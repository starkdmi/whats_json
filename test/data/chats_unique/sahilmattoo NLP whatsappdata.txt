02/04/2019, 13:50 - +91 96633 30703: Would like to see each one of our concern is addressed at the earliest. I feel there is no point taking a week and more and consolidating the concerns and looking to get it addressed since we will losing the weeks  in our course schedule right
02/04/2019, 14:58 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: As i sugested  all of you that after this weekend session we can have a discussion

02/04/2019, 15:00 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: Every individuals concers are different and comes witha backing of different requiremenst every one has
02/04/2019, 15:00 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: As said i shall address all ur issues
02/04/2019, 15:01 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: And i will meet u all over the meeting bridge
02/04/2019, 15:03 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: Requesting you all not to discuss on this meeting here
02/04/2019, 15:03 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: All of u can reach out to me over call any time between 10 am to 7pm on week days
02/04/2019, 15:04 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: And i will always be there  to give a best possible resolution if its possible
02/04/2019, 18:50 - +91 96633 30703: Thanks Abhijeet
04/04/2019, 20:13 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: Hey all as discussed with u sahil  shall address all the queries. 

As discussed please share ur querys on eda if any to me
04/04/2019, 20:14 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: So that sahil can address them appropriately
04/04/2019, 20:14 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: And well enough
06/04/2019, 06:49 - +91 96633 30703: Hi Abhijeet, i shared the queries on EDA. Apart from answering our queries, bottom line for EDA we may need to have dedicated session and would advise to use multiple different datasets (atleast 5-10 or more) amble no of datasets to guide us and that only will help us to understand better and ask more queries. Otherwise queries or questions will be subjective only to the dataset(Pima) what we encountered and being used for guidance in mentor session right.

06/04/2019, 07:01 - +91 96633 30703: Without guiding us with multiple cases, examples, challenges and approaches to handle that, mentorship session will be frankly  not helpful. My suggestion is may we spend more or good  time in understanding on EDA as this portion would take around 70-80% of our work in model building.
06/04/2019, 09:21 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: Hey veera. Eda is major protion of the work but that doesnt mean we are only doing it in the 1st module. 

Every data set u get in this program has to go through eda. So u get enough examples along ur way to learn
06/04/2019, 09:23 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: Now coming to a dedicated  session. We minght now not need that currently i mean( now or today.)

06/04/2019, 09:24 - +91 96633 30703: Thanks Abhijeet, that works hopefully get us into the comfort and helps us work independently

28/08/2019, 21:05 - Abhijeet GLIM Ml Mentoring: *Teacher's Day Special*

Dear Students, 

Do you remember the time you struggledüôáüèª to understand a tough concept, dealt with a challenging ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ derivation or felt that your problem was unsolvable ü•¥? 

In your program journey with us, you might have encountered gurus üë®üèª‚Äçüè´üë©‚Äçüè´ who kindled a fire üî•  that ignited your minds üß† with the knowledge you have today. They might have helped you learn new things ü§©, guided you through challenges , supported you through your problems üòá or just made you laugh üòÅ.   

We invite you to take the occasion of Teachers Day to record a 30-second video üé• as a tribute to such Gurus. We would be honored to share these videos with them as well as host some of these videos on our social media channels to showcase their contributions to your learning journey. They would be thrilled to hear from you, and would cherish your messages for years to come.

*How to send your messages*

üëâüèªStep 1: Record üé§ a 30-second video (or less) talking about the impact the Guru(s) has had on your learning journey.  You can talk about what you think is unique about them, or what part of them you admire the most, if they‚Äôve gone out of their way to help you, or just about their personality and how they made learning fun. *Talk from your heart ‚ù§*- it makes a difference. 

üëâüèªStep 2:  Send the video to the program office via email/WhatsApp by 1st Sep 2019.

*Let your GURU feel GREAT too üòä*

05/09/2019, 10:59 - Shabana GlIM: Good Day, Everyone, we are planning to compile all the concerns and queries related to the Recommendation systems. Could you all please mention what are the concerns you are facing in regards to the content?
05/09/2019, 11:55 - +91 88251 91907: I hope this doesn't impact the time allotted for Deep learning
05/09/2019, 11:55 - Shabana GlIM: Nope it wouldnt
05/09/2019, 11:55 - Shabana GlIM: This is jusr for us to work on improving the content
05/09/2019, 11:57 - +91 88251 91907: I felt that the content was not organised properly for which I couldn't connect topics together for a flow
05/09/2019, 11:58 - +91 88251 91907: Many things related to NLP was given , I am sure it was necessary and also gave some introduction how to deal with text data , yet that added to the confusion
05/09/2019, 11:59 - +91 88251 91907: Recommendation system is mostly data mining and programming and the more we practice the more clarity we will have.
05/09/2019, 12:00 - +91 88251 91907: But if you guys happen to improve the content then please share them with us too
05/09/2019, 12:31 - +91 96633 30703: Thanks Sahil being a wonderful mentor and a good guide for us to learn all those complex topics and ofcourse really appreciate your effort and patience in answering the questions and ensuring everyone get the concepts clear..... Lucky to have you early in our journey into the data science üôÇ
05/09/2019, 12:31 - Shabana GlIM: Thank you, Stity
05/09/2019, 12:31 - Shabana GlIM: Waiting for others response
05/09/2019, 12:40 - +91 96633 30703: I was going through the content half way and  lost in getting the concepts ... Tough to connect the dots especially on SVD and hybrid methods
05/09/2019, 12:41 - +91 96633 30703: Not sure whether it requires  way of practicing and understanding it clearly through mentor guidance instead going through the contents
05/09/2019, 13:12 - Shabana GlIM: Thank you Veeramuthu
05/09/2019, 13:38 - +91 97167 24536: Hi Shabana, if possible please add metadata of Amazon Electronic dataset also, which has product name and user review against their product ID, as it is not available as open source. It will help us to try various  RS by using comments and reviews.
05/09/2019, 13:52 - +91 97167 24536: Happy Teacher's Day @919620202750 ...., Thanks for your extra efforts, clarifications of tough topics in a way that we can understand it, and for being such a good mentor....üôÇ
