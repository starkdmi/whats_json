This will involve you dressed in robes, with a photographer, photos on campus. This shall be followed by a celebration dinner at a restaurant of your choice. Or of my choice! In fact, I shall pick the restaurant!!

11/03/2022, 01:45 - sam: DUBLIN 

The past few days of anxiety dissapated as I donned my headphones, played some music and started my way through Sydney airport. Despite not having left the city, I felt like I had begun my travels, and this filled me with an immediate peace to replace the sadness at waving goodbye to my parents. 

No one wants to hear about a bunch of flights, but I would like to brag that I secured a row of 3 and row of 4 on my first and second legs - one of the few perks of covid I suppose. 

Coming into arrivals in Dublin, I saw grandpa waiting for me. A big grin filled my face and we embraced. A short (and terrifying) drive later and I had the same experience with grandma. She was nitter-nattering before I had even finished saying hello. 

The next week was filled with many wholesome walks (the Dodder river, Trinity College, Powerscourt Gardens), numerous museum-esque visits (Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, EPIC museum etc). We also visited the highest pub in Ireland to have a Guiness - they taste so much better over here. Apparently its something to do with the water, the frequency they are poured and how often the tap and its pipes are cleaned. Its also amusing to walk into a pub and see EVERYONE drinking the same drink. 

Hanging out with the grandparents has been lovely. I know its a massive highlight for them to have me around, and all I have to do is smile and look pretty. Nah but really they're so sweet and funny - I don't think I ever realised how savage grandma was as well. She ironed my shirts and I didn't notice or make a comment to her... I didn't hear the end of it. Grandpa is also quite funny. He was telling a story about having many guinesses as a young lad and was looking for a synonym for 'drunk' and came up with 'jolly'. So next time I hit the drinks, I think I'll be getting very jolly. 

We finished off our last night at the opera, Carmen, which was certainly an interesting experience, albeit a long one. 

I have to say, grandpa's driving is the single most terrifying mode of transport I've ever experienced. I've been down narrow mountain trails on a motorbike with trucks flying the opposite direction that have been less nerve racking than sitting in the front seat of this 80 something year old's Mercedes. Its like every single facet of a bad driver has been combined into one creature: no indication, no concept of staying in a lane, ignoring red lights, overconfidence, braking suddenly, braking last second - I could go on. 

Anyway I'm at the airport now so lets just say I'm feeling more confident about my flight to London than I am about grandma and grandpa's drive home from the airport. 

I've never had a chance to spend time alone with the grandparents so I'm really glad I could have such a lovely week with them. Time for London adventures!

15/03/2022, 03:11 - sam: LONDON PT.1

As I stepped off the plane into London for the first time in 11 years, Spotify decided to change my music from techno randomly. Of all things to come on, my favourite British grime artist CASISDEAD comes on with 'Before This'. Unbelievable. 

My first evening was spent catching up with Nyall and Michelle and it was great to see them. Michelle and I visited the old house in Radlett the next morning and I was getting memory after memory popping up in my head as we drove through the main street and pulled up in the drive. We went for a walk in the woods, where I used to walk almost weekly. There was no one on the track at all and it was a beautiful day. I was busy telling Michelle stories about Amber, our first dog, a golden retriever, on the trail. It was a very sentimental experience and I was smiling the whole way. Once again, the hand of serendipity intervened in my day... a golden retriever comes trotting round the corner ahead of us... I almost cried. We hadn't seen anyone on the track at all so far. It was at this point that I realised that London is quite a special place to me. Little did I realise I would be reminded of this fact many more times in the upcoming days. 

Nyall and I had a hit of tennis (I lost, but got him back in chess) before dinner, where Sara, Lauren and Marc Charles (yes I will write his full name) came for 'FND' (the abbreviation for Friday night dinner that they text and even say out loud). It was a really great night catching up with everyone. We chatted until past midnight before realising the time. Then we had to compete with each other in Wordle and Semantle. 

We all (bar Marc Charles) headed into Paddington the next morning for brunch and a stroll before the theatre. It was fantastic to see the historic city bustling with life: street performers and markets, old and modern architecture competing, people everywhere. We went and saw 'A Number', a play, which was dramatic and interesting. 

So Nyall stumbled upon some England vs Ireland rugby tickets the day before and needed to leave the play early. Unsure of where we were seated, he covered his rudeness (of leaving during a play) up by informing all the staff he may need to duck out to the toilet because of a 'medical condition'. When the time came to leave for the rugby, Nyall left and a staff member offered to call him an ambulance!!! 

That evening, I caught up with all of my old school friends from HJPS. The chemistry immediately returned and we were laughing like lifelong friends from the start. It's hard to express how lovely it was to see them all, happy and healthy, after so much time. So much had changed and yet, it felt like nothing had changed at all. We were transported back 13 years to a time without responsibility or stress. We first had some drinks at a Weatherspoon (bit of a hole but definitely authentic), headed to Puttshack to play some mini golf and have some more drinks and then Alex, Oli, Daniel and I left the others to go out in Camden. 

It was dark in Camden. Litter was strewn across the streets. Characters walked up and down the pavement: goths, crackheads and partygoers. We headed to a pub called The World's End. I walked in and was immediately stoked. Metal was blasting from the speakers and there were punks and goths everywhere: drunk, sad, shouting and making out with one another. A quick beer and laugh and we headed to Electric Ballroom and danced like we weren't fed up of clubbing, because for an evening that was true for everyone. 

The next day my brain was angry with me, but I had no time for a hangover, only a Sunday lunch with the family at a classic pub, a blazing fireplace keeping us company by our table. And then, it was time for the game with Nyall. 

When you first arrive in England as a resident, people ask you who you support in football before they ask you your name. I used to say Arsenal, because JJ supported them. But after a few months, it was true - football was life and Arsenal became my team. 
¬†¬†¬† If you asked me a year ago what football team I supported, I probably would have said no one. After so long in Australia with no friends following (Ben and JJ excluded), it just wasn't relevant anymore. 
¬†¬†¬† As Nyall and I got closer to the stadium, I felt my hairs begin to stand on end. The tube was packed with supporters. We hopped off and fans here and there were chanting already. Packed like sardines, we filed out of the station. My hangover faded into the distance as we came into the open. Thousands of fans were walking in unision to the home of Arsenal. I was one of them already: a fan. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† It was again quite emotional for me to walk into the Emirates Stadium. Crossing the bridge to the stadium and seeing the banners of legends: Henry, Bergkamp, Viera. The fans were now in full force and RED ARMY and ARSENAL were screamed every moment by hundreds of fans at once. What a moment. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† The game was great quality. Arsenal were in great form and √òdegaard was a highlight to see. Two goals for Arsenal and a dominant peformance against Leicester. By the end of it, I was joining in with RED ARMY and ARSENAL chants. It was wonderful experience in all. My first premier league match. 

I got a lift home with Harry and went over to his house to hang out with him and Alex. We had time for a proper catchup and I think we made good progress on the 11 years we had missed. We got on so well that I was still stoked to catch them for breakfast the next morning! I'm on my way to Chelmsford now to see my Grandpa Don, Naomi, Mark and the kids.

28/03/2022, 18:36 - +61 424 993 883: Well you were 2 games behind when we spoke yesterday, so clearly you have the momentum. But you also might crumble in these crucial games whereas dad will enter with a ruthless ‚Äòbusiness end‚Äô mentality...

22/04/2022, 15:52 - Flower: The federal seat of North Sydney (my electorate) has 3 good candidates. The incumbent is Liberal Trent Zimmerman- he‚Äôs hugely popular and will very likely win. Catherine Renshaw (human rights law professor) is running for Labor. Kylea Tink (former Camp Quality CEO) is running as an Independant
22/04/2022, 16:01 - Oddball: <Media omitted>
22/04/2022, 16:12 - sam: Labor but I haven't looked at candidates
22/04/2022, 16:12 - sam: Not that I can make a difference in East Killara
22/04/2022, 17:58 - Massive Water Dragon: I‚Äôm voting for Nicolette Boelle

25/04/2022, 21:20 - +61 424 993 883: The newfound access to the prestigious Killara CBD will result in wheelchair users across the state flocking to visit / live in Killara. Property prices will skyrocket. The Killara Inn will never have another vacant room again. Lindfield and Gordon will crumble once their only competitive advantage over Killara is obliterated. We are witnessing a revolution.
25/04/2022, 21:51 - Massive Water Dragon: Yes Benas üòÇ
25/04/2022, 22:05 - sam: It is also appalling that it has taken this long for them to make the station accessible

26/04/2022, 05:36 - +61 424 993 883: Expensive undertaking for small station like Killara, especially given both stations either side of it have lifts

07/05/2022, 02:49 - sam: I would like to share an excerpt from my journal that I think @61428567518 should particularly enjoy, but all will find amusing:

[Conversation in a hostel in the South of France]

Anyway, Livia was telling me about how she really respects people that do what they believe strongly in. As an anecdote, she started telling me about her time in San Sebastian [Spanish area bordering France] and how she came across this community of people living outside of Western Civilisation. The way she encountered these people was by pure coincidence. She was looking for somewhere to have a coffee and she stumbled into a cute looking cafe called... Yellow Deli!!! Apparently she spent a while talking to a staff member about their way of life and accepted an invitation to visit their village in the mountains the next day. She went and spent the following day with them but left before night because although they were very welcoming, it was a strange vibe at night. I then looked on Google Maps at the Yellow Deli she was talking about and it looked almost exactly the same as the one I know from Katoomba. I proceeded to tell her about my own encounters with Yelleth Delleth. What a coincidence!
07/05/2022, 07:37 - Oddball: üëç
07/05/2022, 08:15 - Flower: Wow that is Greve
07/05/2022, 08:16 - Flower: Yeah pretty sure they started in the US then spread their yellow deli wings around the world
07/05/2022, 08:16 - Flower: Spreading delicious sandwiches and child abuse

24/05/2022, 19:31 - Oddball: Is there a but
24/05/2022, 19:32 - Massive Water Dragon: A bit suspicious that no other boats were going out‚Ä¶.

Things changed quickly, giant waves üåä and somewhere between frightening and terrifying, few passengers screaming üò± in terror. Life jackets üõü distributed and returned
24/05/2022, 19:32 - Massive Water Dragon: <Media omitted>
24/05/2022, 19:33 - Oddball: That‚Äôs reckless of them
24/05/2022, 19:33 - Oddball: Putting money over your safety
24/05/2022, 19:33 - Massive Water Dragon: Very bedraggled, saturated, NEVER EVER EVER going on a boat again and that includes the Manly ferry. Totally reckless of them.
24/05/2022, 19:33 - Oddball: They would have known the conditions
24/05/2022, 19:34 - Oddball: Demand your money back - just on principle- and copy in tourist office- they‚Äôll kill people
24/05/2022, 19:35 - Massive Water Dragon: The man without the life jacket - his poor wife was a screaming wreck on the floor of the boat. She was hysterical, even Clare who was screaming appeared calm compared to the poor French lady.
24/05/2022, 19:35 - Massive Water Dragon: No issue with refund, they wouldn‚Äôt dare not.
24/05/2022, 19:36 - Massive Water Dragon: I‚Äôm just waiting for my heart beat to return to something near normal.

Remember Eddy‚Äôs Chinese Restaurant which then became several other Chinese restaurants? 

Accepting guesses for the new business which has opened!
15/06/2022, 10:27 - Lani Peasant: Have you all also seen the new sign at the koola lights that points in the wrong direction
15/06/2022, 10:27 - Lani Peasant: It says ‚Äòeast Killara shops‚Äô and is pointed towards lindfield
15/06/2022, 10:28 - Massive Water Dragon: Lol yes!!

Your guess Lani? However if you k is because you‚Äôve seen it, please don‚Äôt participate.
15/06/2022, 10:28 - Lani Peasant: No I haven‚Äôt seen it
15/06/2022, 10:29 - Lani Peasant: I guess the freezer store is expanding
15/06/2022, 10:30 - Massive Water Dragon: So we now have a cafe, bakery, random frozen meats, estate agent, bottle shop, chemist, hairdresser, doctor, dentist and a brand new business.
15/06/2022, 10:30 - Flower: Is it a hot dollar store
15/06/2022, 10:30 - Massive Water Dragon: No
15/06/2022, 10:31 - Massive Water Dragon: Clue. It is something a member of our family would use.
15/06/2022, 10:31 - Flower: Oh it‚Äôs a pool shop with specialty chlorine
15/06/2022, 10:32 - Massive Water Dragon: Brilliant guess. But no.
15/06/2022, 10:33 - Lani Peasant: This list makes it sound notably less crappy than it is
15/06/2022, 10:34 - Massive Water Dragon: It is not crappy. It is class (and not Greve)
15/06/2022, 10:34 - Massive Water Dragon: It actually raises the quality of the East Killara Shopping Village.
15/06/2022, 10:36 - Flower: Is it a boutique T2 store
15/06/2022, 10:37 - Massive Water Dragon: No. Decent guess. Wrong member of the family. It‚Äôs highly specific.
15/06/2022, 11:22 - Flower: Is it a Japanese kimono store
15/06/2022, 11:34 - Massive Water Dragon: And which family member would this be for Benas?
15/06/2022, 11:34 - Massive Water Dragon: But no.

10/07/2022, 19:13 - sam: Just watched Ben is Best's Joe Berry speech - amazing! I actually found it really interesting, obviously due to the kingly delivery. I was just wondering
1. Was that recording in front of the dinner at the race course or recorded earlier and the replay shown?
2. Is there a youtube link for the q&a?
3. Is there a youtube link for the winner announcement?
Amazing stuff joe benny!

11/07/2022, 08:48 - Flower: Thank of! 
1. That was the presentation at the Coca Cola head offices earlier in the day. It wasn‚Äôt shown at the dinner
2. Yeah a proper recording of the presentation (not just an awkward camera streaming at front of room) will be uploaded which includes the first half of the q&a (they don‚Äôt show the rest as the general answer questions are ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô), but dunno when it will be uploaded
3. Yeah think this will be uploaded too but isn‚Äôt there uet
11/07/2022, 09:01 - Oddball: Did they upload in prior years? I can‚Äôt see anything. Perhaps ask the Auld fella. Howard asked previously too.

13/07/2022, 16:57 - Oddball: That in itself is reputational

Johnny, who helped ben get into aldi, is earning at least >$250k a year at IMC after 1.5 years there - I would expect more than that though.

In school, they both competed at the international maths olympiad and earned bronze, a phenomenal achievement. 

A current student at killara high just won GOLD in the international maths olympiad. This is ENORMOUS.

10/09/2022, 20:48 - sam: Hi fam, if you havent heard, Canva has decided to put me in the same team (Data Warehouse) as I interned in, despite me requesting that I was moved and signing a contract under the group of teams I was more interested in (Backend). Its looking likely that Ill need to spend 3 to 6 months wasting my time in a team im not interested in, delaying my career progression, reputation and general enjoyment/interest in my new role. I am thinking of sending an email to HR for them to view on monday morning before they start dealing with my situation. They essentially have monday and only monday to deal with it, so I was thinking it was a good idea to start off HRs day with a clear message of how this decision has impacted me as well as some suggestions from me. I dont want to sound passive aggressive, and also canva is super casual and personable so you dont need to worry about that side of things, I was just hoping that sending an email along these lines is acceptable and non aggressive. Thanks!
10/09/2022, 20:48 - sam: Hi Van, 

I hope are having a good weekend! 

I've been thinking about our conversation yesterday and I have had a few ideas I would like to suggest. 

Naturally, I'm not super familiar with the process of seeing which team has space (if that's even a feasible option right now), but if it's helpful to you in terms of targeting specific teams for potential last minute space, this is the list I compiled during my internship of the teams that I found most desirable to join: video, photo editing, editing product, editing platform, print, presentations, pro suite and teams product. 

I mentioned that the learning curve in the Data Warehouse is large, meaning that if I were to change team after 3 or 6 months, then I would not have had time to learn enough to contribute anything valuable to the company. It seems that the alternative would be to complete a minor, autonomous project in the meantime - something more suited to an intern. Pardon my assumption, but these sorts of intern projects appear to use less resources than the incorporation and training of a new grad. If it is going to be the case that I spend the first stint of my grad role completing this kind of project, then I would think it could be much more productive that I completed an equivalent project in Backend instead. This way, whatever I worked on would teach me some transferable skills for when the resources became available for me to be incorporated as a grad. Furthermore, the few days I spent in Backend at the end of my internship revealed that there is a huge backlog of features that still need addressing - so the work definitely exists for me to do. 

I will be honest; this situation has disappointed me. I was extremely excited to join Canva and give everything to a new team in Backend, and so finding this out right before my start date has been a bit distressing. I signed a contract as a Backend Engineer and have been sent a new contract, with a new role that I'm not happy with, just days before my start date, which I believe is quite unprofessional. With just a bit more notice, I have no doubt that this situation could have been resolved. 

Lastly, I believe that our Monday meeting hasn't quite been booked in yet. I recall you suggesting a meeting at noon but I'm more than happy to meet later in the day if this takes more time. 

Thanks!
Sam
10/09/2022, 20:53 - Oddball: Sam - as a first draft it‚Äôs a start but it need‚Äôs tightening- a lot. Some wording definitely needs changing and may not reflect well. Let‚Äôs discuss- suggest strongly not to send yet. Dad

12/09/2022, 15:23 - sam: Thanks all for the team effort yesterday in raising my spirits and crafting an immaculate email. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll be joining the team I'm not keen on with a transition in February. They are making an exception for me in order to move me earlier than twelve months, which is the consolation.
12/09/2022, 17:41 - Flower: Consolation 1 is that you got to travel, 2 is joining backend in a few months, and 3 is you can join a million social clubs while you‚Äôre in the peasant team, then just stay in the ones you want by the time you hit backend in Feb so you can hit the ground running without (as many) distractions
12/09/2022, 20:59 - sam: A positive way to view it so thanks ben! I will do my best to remain stoic in front of the company.

Anyway just thought you should know I was rushed to Hospital on Wednesday with a suspected Heart attack but it‚Äôs a false alarm and all tests proved negative. It was a shit experience but outcome brill. Posssible clot but not sure and got some more tests next week.
16/09/2022, 22:11 - Oddball: Shell‚Äôs note-
Hi , it was quite a shock , I called an ambulance straight away , fortunately nyall was coherent all the time and has been tested comprehensively in the hospital.   He feels fine now, no more episodes of pain and has gone to have a gentle game of tennis doubles this morning. 
It‚Äôs very unlike Nyall to complain - so that was the scary part . 
He will go to a rapid chest clinic next week - and I want him to get checked out with a cardiologist.   

Thanks for messaging xx

01/11/2022, 12:05 - Lani Peasant: Oh poor thing
02/11/2022, 15:42 - Flower: We‚Äôre running a company-wide survey to ask if people would feel comfortable with us reversing the mandatory covid vaccination policy
02/11/2022, 15:42 - Flower: Aka allowing non-vaccinated people to be hired
02/11/2022, 15:43 - Flower: Thoughts?
02/11/2022, 15:44 - Massive Water Dragon: I think we have to move with the times, and COVID is not considered to be under control. I believe it is no longer necessary to enquire as to staff's vaccination status. So yes, a reversal is supported by Ther
02/11/2022, 15:44 - Massive Water Dragon: Now* not Not!
02/11/2022, 15:45 - Lani Peasant: Nup, speaks to the character of these people, don‚Äôt hire people that won‚Äôt listen to direction
02/11/2022, 15:47 - Massive Water Dragon: It is no longer a direction but a recommendation
02/11/2022, 15:47 - Lani Peasant: Yes but it was a direction when they refused
02/11/2022, 15:48 - Massive Water Dragon: That was then, this is now
02/11/2022, 15:48 - Massive Water Dragon: People have strong views on vaccines, which is frankly none of our business
02/11/2022, 15:48 - Lani Peasant: I completely disagree, it‚Äôs a matter of public health
02/11/2022, 17:50 - Flower: I agreed with terminating the unvaccinated when we brought the policy in at the time, and I agreed with the policy. But am also open to reversing it now to help fix critical staff shortage nationally. Much harder to recruit people in rural areas with the policy in place
02/11/2022, 17:54 - sam: Reverse it
02/11/2022, 17:54 - Oddball: So would you stop all unvaxed kids from childcare and school
02/11/2022, 18:06 - Lani Peasant: It‚Äôs not the child‚Äôs fault their parent is an idiot so no, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good thing
02/11/2022, 18:09 - Flower: Def not a good thing, but now that it‚Äôs not a massive public health issue it‚Äôs probs a good thing to integrate the anti-vaxxers in society where possible (ie letting them stack shelves to help the economy)
02/11/2022, 18:10 - Lani Peasant: But what about this
02/11/2022, 18:11 - Flower: I agree with that^ but we don‚Äôt have the luxury of choosing candidates based on character
02/11/2022, 18:11 - Flower: We used to, but not anymore
02/11/2022, 18:12 - Oddball: Diversity of views in democracy. If they don‚Äôt follow management policy then they are out
02/11/2022, 18:12 - Oddball: They may even have to give me a job
03/11/2022, 18:27 - Massive Water Dragon: None of you will believe the job offer I just got!!!!!
03/11/2022, 18:27 - Lani Peasant: Nespresso manager
03/11/2022, 18:27 - Lani Peasant: Rebetzin
03/11/2022, 18:27 - Flower: COO/CFO at Copyright Agency?
03/11/2022, 18:28 - Massive Water Dragon: Lol you lot!!!!!
03/11/2022, 18:28 - Massive Water Dragon: Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm highly qualified to do‚Ä¶..
03/11/2022, 18:29 - Lani Peasant: Mousse maker
03/11/2022, 18:29 - Flower: Salmon r√ºlard gatekeeper
03/11/2022, 18:29 - Massive Water Dragon: Your Rebetzin guess is closer
03/11/2022, 18:29 - Massive Water Dragon: Fancy typing Benas!
03/11/2022, 18:30 - Oddball: Janice‚Äôs job
03/11/2022, 18:31 - Massive Water Dragon: Dad is closest
03/11/2022, 18:31 - Lani Peasant: Stuart‚Äôs job
03/11/2022, 18:31 - Lani Peasant: Your old job?!
03/11/2022, 18:32 - Massive Water Dragon: My old job, no Janice, no director, reporting directly to the EDD‚Ä¶..who is Stuart, and he says he‚Äôll move the CAU to Chatswood if I‚Äôll take it!!!!!
03/11/2022, 18:33 - Lani Peasant: Omg
03/11/2022, 18:33 - Lani Peasant: Will you do it
03/11/2022, 18:33 - Lani Peasant: More money?
03/11/2022, 18:33 - Lani Peasant: Chatswood is huge
03/11/2022, 18:34 - Flower: Oh wow
03/11/2022, 18:34 - Flower: Big wow
03/11/2022, 18:34 - Lani Peasant: May the record state that I guessed it
03/11/2022, 18:34 - Flower: Fixed term 24 month contract then retire
03/11/2022, 18:38 - Massive Water Dragon: Well I think he‚Äôs all talk as he can‚Äôt move CAU to Chatswood!!
03/11/2022, 18:40 - Flower: Where‚Äôs Janice?
03/11/2022, 18:58 - Massive Water Dragon: Not sure, being moved sideways maybe. CAU is being moved to entirely different program area, hence now under Stuart. 

I feel I‚Äôve moved on, don‚Äôt think I could go back, it nearly killed me. It was the best and worst job ever.
03/11/2022, 18:59 - Oddball: Can I apply?
03/11/2022, 18:59 - Massive Water Dragon: The only reason I‚Äôm even mulling is because it‚Äôs Stuart. But I‚Äôve mulled now and am done.
03/11/2022, 18:59 - Massive Water Dragon: No you don‚Äôt work hard enough!

‚Ä¢ Nova Peris okay but one dimensional 
‚Ä¢ Allegra Spender very very very good

Of course his diet is so much better than mine that it‚Äôs a wonder it‚Äôs not me with all this instead of him as he eats so sensibly!  Off to bed now.  Xxx
