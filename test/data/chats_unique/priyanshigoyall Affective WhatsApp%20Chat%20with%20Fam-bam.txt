10/28/17, 10:08 PM - Sahil: Ok i am in the room
10/28/17, 10:12 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: I am coming
10/29/17, 12:28 AM - Sahil: <Media omitted>
10/29/17, 12:28 AM - Sahil: Something to eat..?
10/29/17, 8:19 PM - Kunal Usc: Room booked from 11-2
10/29/17, 8:19 PM - Kunal Usc: Leavey
11/2/17, 4:44 PM - Kunal Usc: How many substrings can be formed from a string of length n? - O(n^2)
11/2/17, 4:44 PM - Kunal Usc: Why?
11/2/17, 4:44 PM - Kunal Usc: Or how?
11/2/17, 4:48 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Because
11/2/17, 4:49 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Starting with substrings of length 1, you'll get n substrings
11/2/17, 4:49 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: And if you consider a substring of length n, there will be just 1. So, you basically sum all of the cases in between
11/2/17, 4:51 PM - Kunal Usc: Hmm?

abc

{a,b,c, ab, bc, abc}
11/2/17, 4:51 PM - Kunal Usc: Is ac not included because substring are continuous?
11/2/17, 4:52 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: One sec
11/2/17, 4:53 PM - Sahil: Kahan hai yeh question..?
11/2/17, 4:53 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Nope. It has to be continuous no
11/2/17, 4:55 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: So, you start with n substrings of length 1 and then n-1 of length 2..and 1 string of length n
11/2/17, 4:55 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: And all the cases in between
11/2/17, 4:55 PM - Kunal Usc: Got it
11/2/17, 4:55 PM - Kunal Usc: So take my example and solve
11/2/17, 4:56 PM - Kunal Usc: String = abc
11/2/17, 4:57 PM - Kunal Usc: Victor's slides
11/2/17, 4:57 PM - Kunal Usc: DP II
11/2/17, 4:57 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Yes. So, when you take the series n+ n-1+ n-2...1, you get  n√ó(n+1)/2.

Here n=3, so you get 6 substrings no
11/2/17, 4:58 PM - Kunal Usc: Got it
11/2/17, 4:58 PM - Kunal Usc: Cool, thanks
11/2/17, 4:58 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: I had looked it up sometime back
11/2/17, 4:58 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: üòÖ
11/2/17, 4:59 PM - Kunal Usc: Coooool
11/2/17, 4:59 PM - Kunal Usc: Got to pay more attention to O() rather than n^2 in O(n^2)
11/2/17, 4:59 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Yeah

1/8/18, 11:51 AM - Kunal Usc: B O S S
1/8/18, 12:00 PM - Kunal Usc: NLP has no project anymore?
1/8/18, 12:00 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs 40% assignments
1/8/18, 12:00 PM - Kunal Usc: And 4 exams apparently
1/8/18, 12:00 PM - Kunal Usc: LOL
1/8/18, 12:02 PM - Sahil: Kahan likha hai

1/8/18, 12:04 PM - Kunal Usc: Absolute grading is a murder
1/8/18, 12:04 PM - Kunal Usc: Look at those numbers
1/8/18, 12:05 PM - Kunal Usc: Zero error margin
1/8/18, 12:05 PM - Sahil: Hmm immersive mei group project hai

1/8/18, 12:07 PM - Kunal Usc: It should be fun
1/8/18, 12:07 PM - Sahil: Haan
1/8/18, 12:08 PM - Kunal Usc: Arora, if you take it, I‚Äôll take it

3) NLP and Immersive

1/8/18, 12:13 PM - Sahil: Will attend class
1/8/18, 12:13 PM - Sahil: First
1/8/18, 12:13 PM - Kunal Usc: I‚Äôm sure NLP will kill my GPA
1/8/18, 12:14 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: How come you are taking nlp?
1/8/18, 12:14 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs demanding. But so is Immersive
1/8/18, 12:14 PM - Kunal Usc: Please read all the chats :P
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: NLP literally has: 
1) Assignments 
2) Reading assignments 
3) Exams (FOUR)
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: Who keeps 4 exams?
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: Lol
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Sahil: Last exam can be taken online

1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: Exam is exam
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: Online or written
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: People were majorly disappointed about the project
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Sahil: It has 5% weightage
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: Exactly
1/8/18, 12:15 PM - Kunal Usc: 5 percent is 5 marks here :P
1/8/18, 12:16 PM - Kunal Usc: Have you seen the grading guidelines? Absolutely anal
1/8/18, 12:16 PM - Kunal Usc: 92 above - A
90 above - A-
1/8/18, 12:16 PM - Kunal Usc: Looks at that gap
1/8/18, 12:17 PM - Kunal Usc: It also doesn‚Äôt mean that if the grading guidelines are stringent that the course will be easier
1/8/18, 12:17 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: What is the scene with immersive? Absolute grading?
1/8/18, 12:17 PM - Kunal Usc: Nope
1/8/18, 12:17 PM - Kunal Usc: As in, there‚Äôs no grading guidelines as such
1/8/18, 12:17 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs based on the final project
1/8/18, 12:18 PM - Kunal Usc: Class participation - 10%
Personal webpage - 20%
Team webpage - 20% 
Project - 50%
1/8/18, 12:18 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: That sounds like something you'd like üòõ
1/8/18, 12:18 PM - Kunal Usc: Haha
1/8/18, 12:19 PM - Kunal Usc: My first priority is still blockchain
1/8/18, 12:19 PM - Kunal Usc: NLP is way too demanding
1/8/18, 12:19 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Email the prof
1/8/18, 12:19 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: For blockchain
1/8/18, 12:19 PM - Kunal Usc: IR is a fresh fresh start
1/8/18, 12:19 PM - Kunal Usc: * Immersive
1/8/18, 12:20 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: That'll help your case
1/8/18, 12:20 PM - Kunal Usc: Immersive is starting from -10.
1/8/18, 12:20 PM - Kunal Usc: Saying what?
1/8/18, 12:21 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: So, if a prof wants you in his class, you can get the course easily without the department clearance. You just have to convince him to take you in
1/8/18, 12:22 PM - Kunal Usc: Lol
1/8/18, 12:22 PM - Kunal Usc: ‚ÄúConvince him‚Äù
1/8/18, 12:25 PM - Kunal Usc: Did you drop your request?
1/8/18, 12:41 PM - Sahil: Immersive and IR would be easy on grades
1/8/18, 12:49 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Nope
1/8/18, 12:49 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: I will drop it today
1/8/18, 12:49 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Exactly
1/8/18, 12:50 PM - Kunal Usc: I really doubt it
1/8/18, 12:50 PM - Kunal Usc: IR is NOT as easy as we think it is
1/8/18, 12:50 PM - Kunal Usc: Immersive is technically absolute
1/8/18, 12:51 PM - Kunal Usc: Drop now
1/8/18, 12:52 PM - Kunal Usc: Immersive should be fun but
1/8/18, 12:52 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: It won't affect you any way. You will get preference over me
1/8/18, 12:52 PM - Kunal Usc: Lol! Who said
1/8/18, 12:53 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: GPA
1/8/18, 12:53 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Also, are you coming for NLP today?

1/8/18, 1:03 PM - Kunal Usc: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll take NLP
1/8/18, 1:03 PM - Kunal Usc: I‚Äôll take Immersive worst case
1/8/18, 1:03 PM - Kunal Usc: Or MSD
1/8/18, 1:03 PM - Kunal Usc: So I‚Äôll skip NLP
1/8/18, 1:04 PM - Sahil: do you know anyone who has taken VR earlier
1/8/18, 1:05 PM - Kunal Usc: This is the first time
1/8/18, 1:05 PM - Sahil: hmm

3/23/18, 2:36 PM - Kunal Usc: Everyone‚Äôs blowing out of proportion as always
3/23/18, 2:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: It isnt cool what happened
3/23/18, 2:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Anyway
3/23/18, 2:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Elon Muskk
3/23/18, 2:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: He'd be amazing
3/23/18, 2:36 PM - Kunal Usc: It was a legit error
3/23/18, 2:37 PM - Kunal Usc: None of them who‚Äôre complaining have 2 billion users on their platform
3/23/18, 2:37 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: They are required by the law to disclose that this happened
3/23/18, 2:37 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Uber did it too
3/23/18, 2:37 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: With their driver data leak
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Kunal Usc: He‚Äôs 33 years old
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Kunal Usc: When it happened, he was legit 28
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: That is no excuse.
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Kunal Usc: And it wasn‚Äôt even his fault
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Kunal Usc: Cambridge said they deleted the data
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Kunal Usc: He believe them
3/23/18, 2:38 PM - Kunal Usc: * believed them
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: And never followed up
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Kunal Usc: He can‚Äôt go to their house and check
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Real solid argument
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Kunal Usc: That‚Äôs my point
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs okay it happened
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Kunal Usc: Not like he‚Äôs saying it didn‚Äôt
3/23/18, 2:39 PM - Kunal Usc: No one made a big deal when it happened to Uber
3/23/18, 2:40 PM - Kunal Usc: The only reason everyone is crying now is - it was political
3/23/18, 2:40 PM - Kunal Usc: And it sort of favored Trump
3/23/18, 2:40 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: It's coming too late and only because NYT was investigating it
3/23/18, 2:40 PM - Kunal Usc: If Hillary would‚Äôve won, no one would‚Äôve cared
3/23/18, 2:40 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Exactly why it was more harmful. The whole idea of fair elections
3/23/18, 2:40 PM - Kunal Usc: But it‚Äôs also legit possible that he didn‚Äôt know
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Not true
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: It's not even about the outcomr
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Kunal Usc: Because after it came out, is only when he understood what happened
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Outcome
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs an error
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs a legit error
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Kunal Usc: And it‚Äôs okay
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Kunal Usc: Errors happen
3/23/18, 2:42 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: People have faced worse for far less

3/23/18, 2:42 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Not a small deal
3/23/18, 2:41 PM - Kunal Usc: Extremely ironic that people want to go and rant about it on ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù
3/23/18, 2:46 PM - Kunal Usc: It‚Äôs an error
3/23/18, 2:46 PM - Kunal Usc: Let it go
3/23/18, 2:46 PM - Kunal Usc: Not like he did it intentionally
3/23/18, 2:46 PM - Kunal Usc: The world is too sensitive
3/23/18, 2:46 PM - Kunal Usc: Everyone needs to chill
3/23/18, 2:46 PM - Kunal Usc: He‚Äôs taken measures now so that it doesn‚Äôt happen

8/25/18, 3:20 PM - Kunal Usc: I was thinking we could join (or they could join us)
8/25/18, 3:20 PM - Kunal Usc: But
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Kunal Usc: I just checked out the maps and it seems like too much of a distance to cover
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: It iss
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Kunal Usc: LA - Lake Tahoe - 7 hours drive
Lake Tahoe - Big Sur - 5 hours drive
Big Sur - LA - 5 hours drive
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Kunal Usc: So I don't think that makes sense
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Kunal Usc: Okay?
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Yeah
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: So what else
8/25/18, 3:21 PM - Kunal Usc: I feel that we should just do Big Sur and back?
8/25/18, 3:22 PM - Kunal Usc: Since I assume only Sanket(h) can drive?
8/25/18, 3:22 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Yeah. Big Sur sounds doable
8/25/18, 3:22 PM - Kunal Usc: Not too may things to do in Big Sur apart from gobbling in the gorgeous views of the coast
8/25/18, 3:22 PM - Kunal Usc: And hikes
8/25/18, 3:22 PM - Kunal Usc: And drinks

8/25/18, 3:24 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Also
8/25/18, 3:25 PM - Kunal Usc: It's convenient for them to make reservations since it's only 2 hours either way for them
8/25/18, 3:25 PM - Kunal Usc: Yes
8/25/18, 3:25 PM - Kunal Usc: Ask him and tell me

8/25/18, 3:25 PM - Kunal Usc: Either way, I'm telling Neha no because it won't work out for us

8/25/18, 3:34 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Now that we are not meeting your friends anyway, we could do someplace closer no?
8/25/18, 3:34 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Like San Diego, similar feels with drinking and chilling

8/25/18, 3:37 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: I feel like big Sur with one person driving is going to be slightly stressful, especially with flight timings and it doesn't make sense to come back on a Sunday after traveling that far
8/25/18, 3:37 PM - Kunal Usc: +1
8/25/18, 3:37 PM - Kunal Usc: San Diego doesn't have that much to see also apart from that Sea World thing

9/23/18, 1:00 PM - Kunal Usc: Lol
9/23/18, 1:00 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: I emailed Su lei
9/23/18, 1:00 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: We have to create a graph, btw
9/23/18, 1:00 PM - Kunal Usc: Did we even figure out false positives and negatives are?
9/23/18, 1:01 PM - Kunal Usc: Oh! So that‚Äôs goood
9/23/18, 1:01 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Yeah dude
9/23/18, 1:01 PM - Kunal Usc: That‚Äôs the first step
9/23/18, 1:01 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: So our first assumption was correct
9/23/18, 1:01 PM - Kunal Usc: About
9/23/18, 1:01 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: We have a precision value but our recall is 0, making our F1 zero
9/23/18, 1:04 PM - Kunal Usc: Exactly
9/23/18, 1:04 PM - Kunal Usc: I was asking Bharat too
9/23/18, 1:04 PM - Kunal Usc: And he isn‚Äôt clear too
9/23/18, 1:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: <Media omitted>
9/23/18, 1:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Built the confusion matrix
9/23/18, 1:36 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Verifies our theory
9/23/18, 1:37 PM - Kunal Usc: Oh!
9/23/18, 1:37 PM - Kunal Usc: Is that what we just spoke about?
9/23/18, 1:37 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: <Media omitted>
9/23/18, 1:38 PM - Kunal Usc: 16 = TP
14 = FN?
9/23/18, 1:38 PM - Kunal Usc: Got it
9/23/18, 1:38 PM - Kunal Usc: 16 people chose AB? 
14 people chose CD? 

The theory predicted AB?
9/23/18, 1:39 PM - Kunal Usc: So 14 is because it falsely identified CD as the negative class
9/23/18, 1:39 PM - Kunal Usc: Right?
9/23/18, 1:39 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: Yes
9/23/18, 1:39 PM - Kunal Usc: Gotchya

9/23/18, 1:46 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: This one was testing only
9/23/18, 1:46 PM - Priyanshi Goyal: But automating will take time
