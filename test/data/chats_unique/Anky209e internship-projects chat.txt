6/2/22, 11:01 AM - Kesaven SM: You need dataset for 3 classes right?
6/2/22, 11:01 AM - Anky: no just 2
6/2/22, 11:01 AM - Anky: normal and disease
6/2/22, 11:02 AM - Kesaven SM: For disease ( we need to classify as acne or eczema )
6/2/22, 11:02 AM - Kesaven SM: So 3 class right?
6/2/22, 11:02 AM - Anky: ya then three
6/2/22, 11:03 AM - Anky: if they need to classify between acne and eczema
6/2/22, 11:03 AM - Kesaven SM: Yeah that's what they need
6/2/22, 11:05 AM - Anky: I have a one more like experimental way but I dont think it will be efficient every time
6/2/22, 11:05 AM - Kesaven SM: What is that?
6/2/22, 11:07 AM - Anky: if they have dataset for two classes of acne and eczema. I will train model for that but when we will give it normal skin it will tell its a disease but with very low probablity what we can do is set a threshold for that probality if its less tha that its normal skin.
6/2/22, 11:08 AM - Kesaven SM: I don't think this will work out all the time
6/2/22, 11:08 AM - Anky: y
6/2/22, 11:08 AM - Anky: yes
6/2/22, 11:08 AM - Kesaven SM: Can you find the dataset ?
6/2/22, 11:08 AM - Anky: no there is datset for just skin disease
6/2/22, 11:13 AM - Kesaven SM: So there is no dataset for the 3 classes?
6/2/22, 11:13 AM - Anky: no
6/2/22, 11:13 AM - Kesaven SM: So what can we do?
6/2/22, 11:14 AM - Anky: do those students have dataset for 2 classes
6/2/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TfQy_3qIlWiEgcYuLwr74rVNAoLW42a_?usp=sharing
6/2/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: We have to ship this system to an student
6/2/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: Can you please run in your system?
6/2/22, 11:24 AM - Anky: wait will run it after this shipping
6/2/22, 11:24 AM - Kesaven SM: Yeah
6/2/22, 11:44 AM - Kesaven SM: hey

6/2/22, 11:44 AM - Anky: i am trying their network is slow
6/2/22, 11:45 AM - Kesaven SM: we need to find a way for skin disease
6/2/22, 11:45 AM - Kesaven SM: As I told u earlier
We need to give raw input and then extraction and classification should be done in our project
6/2/22, 11:45 AM - Kesaven SM: Bt u just give us the code only for classification
The input is already preprocessed image
Then what is the use the project
6/2/22, 11:46 AM - Kesaven SM: actually, the skin disease students are asking about all the background process that is happening?
6/2/22, 12:08 PM - Kesaven SM: Hey
6/2/22, 12:09 PM - Anky: yes sir
6/2/22, 12:09 PM - Kesaven SM: Explanation done?

2) Desicion tree
3) SVC
6/13/22, 11:19 AM - Kesaven SM: SVM We need
6/13/22, 11:19 AM - Anky: and random forest is of three types with tweaked parameters
6/13/22, 11:19 AM - Kesaven SM: Yeah that's fine
6/13/22, 11:20 AM - Anky: SVC is with the worst accuracy
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: That's fine
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Anky: SVC is a  Subset of SVM
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: Oh I see
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Anky: SVM is not an actual algo its a class
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: Okay
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: Then can you please add decision tree alone !?
6/13/22, 11:21 AM - Kesaven SM: They just need the code for this algorithms
6/13/22, 11:22 AM - Kesaven SM: SVM and Decision Tree and random forest
6/13/22, 11:22 AM - Kesaven SM: They don't see the accuracy and all
6/13/22, 11:22 AM - Anky: these are already present
6/13/22, 11:22 AM - Anky: I explained him
6/13/22, 11:22 AM - Kesaven SM: Can we have a seperate folder for each algorithm?
6/13/22, 11:22 AM - Kesaven SM: It's a different student
6/13/22, 11:23 AM - Anky: it will be diffrent notebooks they will have problem running it we can do one thing I can add markdown and divide notebook in diff parts
6/13/22, 11:23 AM - Anky: So they will know where each algo is
6/13/22, 11:24 AM - Kesaven SM: Yeah
6/13/22, 11:24 AM - Kesaven SM: They can see only random forest now
6/13/22, 11:24 AM - Anky: ok
6/13/22, 11:24 AM - Anky: I will add markdown
6/13/22, 11:24 AM - Kesaven SM: Yeah please do
6/13/22, 11:24 AM - Anky: they should try to read code
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Kesaven SM: Also seems like SVM and Decision Tree has few lines of code I guess
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Anky: Its few lines
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Anky: thats all
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Anky: like just importing classes and training
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Anky: I will add comments
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Anky: So they feel good
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Kesaven SM: Ok
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Kesaven SM: Please do that now and send me the code
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Kesaven SM: It's really urgent
6/13/22, 11:25 AM - Anky: yea
6/13/22, 11:34 AM - Anky: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 11:34 AM - Anky: here is the updated file
6/13/22, 11:34 AM - Kesaven SM: Ok
6/13/22, 11:34 AM - Anky: Added markdown and divided diffrent algorithms
Added more comments for SVC and Dtree
6/13/22, 11:35 AM - Kesaven SM: Okay what you have in your task list now?
6/13/22, 11:35 AM - Anky: Brain one only Its downloading
6/13/22, 11:35 AM - Kesaven SM: Complete brain tumor and let me know
6/13/22, 11:35 AM - Anky: ya
6/13/22, 11:36 AM - Anky: I can do more ML web app projects
6/13/22, 11:36 AM - Anky: Or like web development

6/13/22, 11:36 AM - Kesaven SM: Yeah but we have to make sure it's unique projects
6/13/22, 11:37 AM - Kesaven SM: And it has to be completed within 1-2 days
6/13/22, 11:37 AM - Anky: well I gave u ideas I had
6/13/22, 11:37 AM - Kesaven SM: Tracing IP address and details of unidentified participants while academic sessions.

"Background: The links for academic sessions/webinars/CREs are shared by few students to miscreants, who then login into the meeting/sessions using the same link by using ID’s or names of other identified participants.
 After login into the meeting, miscreant/mischievous students creates indiscipline, confusion and use foul abusive languages to disturb the whole meeting.
Summary: Covid Pandemic /Lockdown has resulted in frustrations among students,It has affected their mental health as well, resulting in unwanted behaviours and activities which disturbs the whole class, and the decorum of the session/academic activities.
 The links for academic sessions/webinars/CREs are shared by a few students to miscreants, who then login into the meeting/sessions using the same link by using IDs or names of other identified participants.
 After login into the meeting, miscreant/mischievous students create indiscipline, confusion and use foul abusive languages to disturb the whole meeting.
 Objective: 1. Solutions need to be devised so that the intruders/miscreants are identified.
 2. They should not be able to use IDs and Names of the identified Participants/Students .
 3. It should get easy for the Host to block such intruders which does not happen usually.
 4. Messages (which are usually disturbing and offensive) need to be blocked in such a way that they are not shown in the chat box or displayed during the session."
6/13/22, 11:37 AM - Kesaven SM: Can you do this?
6/13/22, 11:39 AM - Anky: So what exactly I have to create like a webapp for meetings or just a script which blocks IP address
6/13/22, 11:39 AM - Anky: but this list will be of no use if we cant block them
6/13/22, 11:39 AM - Kesaven SM: This is the problem statement
6/13/22, 11:40 AM - Anky: Ya I readed it but not specific
6/13/22, 11:40 AM - Kesaven SM: You can tell me how we can solve this problem
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Kesaven SM: I'll be back in few mins
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Anky: Just one thing I have that is to create our own webapp and use Ip collecting and ban that range of ip to never attend any meeting
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Kesaven SM: Can you again share that?
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Anky: I dont have it
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Kesaven SM: Okay
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Kesaven SM: Complete brain tumor and let me know
6/13/22, 11:41 AM - Anky: ya

6/13/22, 12:55 PM - Anky: yes
6/13/22, 12:56 PM - Anky: It was using old functions in code which were having errors
6/13/22, 12:57 PM - Anky: so instead of changing whole  code functions its easy  and fast to create streamlit app
6/13/22, 12:57 PM - Kesaven SM: So it's sorted?
6/13/22, 12:57 PM - Anky: yea mainly

## Creating a Web Client:
### It will be a webapp for screen recording instead of using GUI person can just open a browser tab while working and start recording on the go.
(We will also create GUI if person needs it to use)

## Uploading recording to cloud on the go
### If a person wants to share recording  with someone he dont have to forward it to every person using too much data instead of that just upload it to S3 bucket and share with just 1 link.
