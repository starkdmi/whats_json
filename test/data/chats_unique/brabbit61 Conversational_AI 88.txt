27/04/2019, 12:08 - Sannidhi Kumar: Do we have that
27/04/2019, 12:08 - Sannidhi Kumar: This is mpi
27/04/2019, 12:21 - Jenit Jain: No
27/04/2019, 12:21 - Jenit Jain: Shit
27/04/2019, 12:21 - Jenit Jain: Then don't have ut
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Sannidhi Kumar: Bro
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Sannidhi Kumar: What's the plan for ai
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Jenit Jain: Going to do all the bad things today
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Jenit Jain: Ontology and all
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Jenit Jain: And the first sessional graph algos
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Jenit Jain: You?
28/04/2019, 10:36 - Sannidhi Kumar: Same same

28/04/2019, 10:37 - Sannidhi Kumar: Where are u doing q from
28/04/2019, 10:37 - Sannidhi Kumar: Wanna solve together?
28/04/2019, 10:37 - Sannidhi Kumar: Prev year papers have many
28/04/2019, 10:39 - Jenit Jain: I'll do the conceptual part
28/04/2019, 10:39 - Jenit Jain: You send every question you solve
28/04/2019, 10:39 - Jenit Jain: Just the q
28/04/2019, 10:39 - Jenit Jain: Then we'll chexk
28/04/2019, 10:39 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah cool
28/04/2019, 10:40 - Sannidhi Kumar: So basically I'm doing chapters 3 5 12 13 14 today
28/04/2019, 10:40 - Sannidhi Kumar: Maaaybe 2 also if I get time
28/04/2019, 10:41 - Jenit Jain: Greedy

28/04/2019, 16:10 - Jenit Jain: Did you start 😂
28/04/2019, 16:11 - Sannidhi Kumar: ive done 10 pages so far 🙈😂
28/04/2019, 16:11 - Jenit Jain: I'm doing 2 3 12 13 15
28/04/2019, 16:11 - Jenit Jain: 10 more than me
28/04/2019, 16:11 - Jenit Jain: Urghh
28/04/2019, 16:11 - Jenit Jain: You remember those food stalls?
28/04/2019, 16:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: 😂😂😂😂
28/04/2019, 16:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: even im doing 2
28/04/2019, 16:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: doing 2 rn actually
28/04/2019, 16:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: which ones?
28/04/2019, 16:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: revels?
28/04/2019, 16:13 - Jenit Jain: no recently outside the 13th block
28/04/2019, 16:13 - Sannidhi Kumar: yepp
28/04/2019, 16:13 - Sannidhi Kumar: i went to those
28/04/2019, 16:14 - Jenit Jain: dude i ordered 5 cinnamon buns from that girl through instagram
28/04/2019, 16:14 - Jenit Jain: i'm waiting to have those before studying
28/04/2019, 16:14 - Jenit Jain: 😂😂😂
28/04/2019, 16:14 - Sannidhi Kumar: 😂😂😂
28/04/2019, 16:14 - Sannidhi Kumar: bro i had tried the brownie
28/04/2019, 16:15 - Sannidhi Kumar: nutella one
28/04/2019, 16:15 - Sannidhi Kumar: didnt like it only
28/04/2019, 16:15 - Jenit Jain: but the cinnamon buns looked too good even that day
28/04/2019, 16:16 - Jenit Jain: dw it'll be up on my instagram
28/04/2019, 16:16 - Jenit Jain: LOL
28/04/2019, 16:16 - Jenit Jain: cant wait
28/04/2019, 16:16 - Jenit Jain: only thing i can do to procrastinate
28/04/2019, 16:17 - Sannidhi Kumar: 😂😂😂
28/04/2019, 18:34 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ohhoo
28/04/2019, 18:34 - Sannidhi Kumar: Clarifying doubts and all on the group xD
28/04/2019, 18:36 - Jenit Jain: i still havent started man
28/04/2019, 18:36 - Jenit Jain: i just cant
28/04/2019, 18:36 - Sannidhi Kumar: Bro I'm still on the 10th page 😂😂
28/04/2019, 18:37 - Jenit Jain: lets just start at 7
28/04/2019, 18:37 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ok
28/04/2019, 18:37 - Sannidhi Kumar: That gives us 23 min
28/04/2019, 18:51 - Jenit Jain: 9
28/04/2019, 18:51 - Sannidhi Kumar: sigh
28/04/2019, 19:00 - Sannidhi Kumar: it's time to begin
28/04/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: How much did you do
29/04/2019, 08:51 - Sannidhi Kumar: Chap 3
29/04/2019, 08:52 - Sannidhi Kumar: U?
29/04/2019, 09:08 - Jenit Jain: 2.1😂
29/04/2019, 10:46 - Sannidhi Kumar: Wow xD
29/04/2019, 10:46 - Sannidhi Kumar: I did 14 now
29/04/2019, 10:54 - Jenit Jain: I'll catch up
29/04/2019, 10:57 - Sannidhi Kumar: Good good xD
29/04/2019, 10:57 - Sannidhi Kumar: I'm gonna do chap 2 now
29/04/2019, 10:58 - Sannidhi Kumar: I think I'll read all these chapters
29/04/2019, 10:58 - Sannidhi Kumar: First
29/04/2019, 10:58 - Sannidhi Kumar: And then solve q
29/04/2019, 11:05 - Jenit Jain: So first studying the questions and then studying the other chapters?
29/04/2019, 11:06 - Sannidhi Kumar: Will read all these, then solve q from all these
29/04/2019, 11:06 - Sannidhi Kumar: It will be around 6 in the evening by that time
29/04/2019, 11:06 - Jenit Jain: Cool
29/04/2019, 11:06 - Sannidhi Kumar: Then read the rest
29/04/2019, 11:06 - Sannidhi Kumar: What's chap 15??
29/04/2019, 11:06 - Sannidhi Kumar: I think we have only 14?
29/04/2019, 11:07 - Jenit Jain: Ha toh that my bad
29/04/2019, 11:07 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ya cool
29/04/2019, 14:24 - Jenit Jain: in uniform search algo, we check if it is a goal state if that is the node that we'll expand next (as it is in the start of the priority queue). We can keep expanding a node continuously down the tree without expanding the other children of the root if the path cost to those children is too high compared to the current node right?
29/04/2019, 14:25 - Jenit Jain: its not like bfs in which you have to go the sibling before expanding the children right?
29/04/2019, 14:25 - Sannidhi Kumar: We can expand either the children or the siblings of the nose
29/04/2019, 14:25 - Sannidhi Kumar: *node
29/04/2019, 14:26 - Sannidhi Kumar: Depending on which has the lower cost
29/04/2019, 14:26 - Jenit Jain: Cool
29/04/2019, 14:26 - Jenit Jain: how much done
29/04/2019, 14:26 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 14:27 - Sannidhi Kumar: And oh I missed 14
29/04/2019, 14:28 - Jenit Jain: full 14 done?
29/04/2019, 14:30 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah its damn small
29/04/2019, 14:31 - Sannidhi Kumar: Wbu
29/04/2019, 14:34 - Jenit Jain: just 2 and 3
29/04/2019, 14:34 - Jenit Jain: i'll start 5 now
29/04/2019, 15:29 - Jenit Jain: what are stuff and things
29/04/2019, 15:30 - Jenit Jain: stuff is basically a part of something and retains the same intrinsic properties even when subdivided. Right? and what about Things
29/04/2019, 15:36 - Sannidhi Kumar: Which chap
29/04/2019, 15:36 - Jenit Jain: 12
29/04/2019, 16:07 - Jenit Jain: It's only .1 .2 .5 .6
29/04/2019, 16:07 - Jenit Jain: For the 12th chapter
29/04/2019, 16:09 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 16:10 - Jenit Jain: Arre ya I did the full thing shish
29/04/2019, 16:23 - Sannidhi Kumar: What
29/04/2019, 16:24 - Sannidhi Kumar: That's a lot lmao
29/04/2019, 16:57 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah, but idk what they mean when they say that stuff "specifies" no intrinsic properties. Does it mean the same thing?
29/04/2019, 16:57 - Jenit Jain: yeah exactly the definition is the problem
29/04/2019, 16:57 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah
29/04/2019, 16:58 - Sannidhi Kumar: Idek what kind of q they will ask from this chap dude
29/04/2019, 16:58 - Sannidhi Kumar: Gotta see old papers
29/04/2019, 16:58 - Sannidhi Kumar: Things is not even defined btw
29/04/2019, 17:01 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:06 - Jenit Jain: we dont have that proving
29/04/2019, 17:06 - Jenit Jain: havent seen it tho
29/04/2019, 17:06 - Jenit Jain: they might expect us to like just write about it
29/04/2019, 17:07 - Jenit Jain: theres a para on optimality of A*
29/04/2019, 17:44 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:44 - Sannidhi Kumar: Try this
29/04/2019, 17:45 - Jenit Jain: okay
29/04/2019, 17:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 17:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: I'm getting some diff ans for dfs and uniform cost
29/04/2019, 17:54 - Sannidhi Kumar: Bro even a* I have no clue what she's done
29/04/2019, 17:55 - Jenit Jain: wait for 10
29/04/2019, 17:55 - Jenit Jain: i'll do and then we'll check
29/04/2019, 17:55 - Sannidhi Kumar: Cool cool
29/04/2019, 18:08 - Sannidhi Kumar: That arrow points from C to F btw
29/04/2019, 18:10 - Jenit Jain: dfs is also s a g1
29/04/2019, 18:10 - Sannidhi Kumar: But it says dont take the one that loops
29/04/2019, 18:12 - Jenit Jain: i think its written in the text book that we use explored states so that it doesnt go in infinite loop
29/04/2019, 18:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: That's for graph search right
29/04/2019, 18:12 - Jenit Jain: so when it goes back to A, no other node will be traversed from that A noed
29/04/2019, 18:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: I guess this is tree search?
29/04/2019, 18:12 - Jenit Jain: how is all this diff
29/04/2019, 18:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: What do u mean
29/04/2019, 18:13 - Sannidhi Kumar: Actually in tree search
29/04/2019, 18:13 - Sannidhi Kumar: It gets stuck in that loop
29/04/2019, 18:13 - Jenit Jain: Oh
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: wait divya is confirming
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: okay yeah so according to graph search it should be s a g1
29/04/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: why are you getting A* diff
29/04/2019, 18:17 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah got the same
29/04/2019, 18:18 - Sannidhi Kumar: Took the arrow wrong
29/04/2019, 18:20 - Jenit Jain: so if they havent specified which one (tree or graph ) then do we just assume it to be graph ?
29/04/2019, 18:22 - Jenit Jain: dude if the path cost from S A G1 was less than S A B C G2 then we would consider the first sequence only right?
29/04/2019, 18:23 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ok uniform cost also I got the same thing
29/04/2019, 18:23 - Sannidhi Kumar: Looks like no?
29/04/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: haan exactly because i remember he always drew the explored states on the side
29/04/2019, 18:24 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yup
29/04/2019, 18:25 - Sannidhi Kumar: So only dfs we're not sure of now
29/04/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: also in A* algo, once we find a final state, we expand the other frontiers also till the value till that node is greater than the goal state so see if there are more optimal parts
29/04/2019, 18:25 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yaa but that's because he solved only uniform cost and a* in class 😂
29/04/2019, 18:25 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yep
29/04/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: bro how is this person even connecting A and C. there is no direct link in the graph
29/04/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: its a decent assumption so only graph based algos
29/04/2019, 18:26 - Sannidhi Kumar: That's whattt
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: eh fuck it
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Sannidhi Kumar: Let's see what divya says
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: our dfs is correct
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: i didnt send her the question
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ohh
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: wait i'll ask the dfs
29/04/2019, 18:27 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ya ask ask
29/04/2019, 18:28 - Sannidhi Kumar: Because the textbook does not tell us what to do when there's a loop
29/04/2019, 18:28 - Sannidhi Kumar: But for bfs we keep that explored state right
29/04/2019, 18:28 - Sannidhi Kumar: Graph based
29/04/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: yes yes
29/04/2019, 18:42 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 18:45 - Jenit Jain: This is toh 8 puzzle problem
29/04/2019, 18:45 - Jenit Jain: Dude in the paper it's written missing info may be assumed according
29/04/2019, 18:46 - Jenit Jain: So just mention explored states are used
29/04/2019, 18:51 - Sannidhi Kumar: Hmm ok
29/04/2019, 18:51 - Sannidhi Kumar: What do we write under time complexity for each depth?
29/04/2019, 18:51 - Sannidhi Kumar: It's not the asymptotic one right
29/04/2019, 18:54 - Jenit Jain: That only we have to write no
29/04/2019, 19:03 - Sannidhi Kumar: Howw
29/04/2019, 19:04 - Sannidhi Kumar: Asymptotic is when u have infinite modes
29/04/2019, 19:04 - Sannidhi Kumar: *nodes
29/04/2019, 19:04 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 19:04 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 19:04 - Sannidhi Kumar: Same for 2c
29/04/2019, 19:04 - Sannidhi Kumar: Check please 🙈
29/04/2019, 19:11 - Jenit Jain: This seems right
29/04/2019, 19:11 - Jenit Jain: Time complexity part ido
29/04/2019, 19:11 - Jenit Jain: This is I'll check
29/04/2019, 19:21 - Jenit Jain: Everything is right but what's that 62 thing
29/04/2019, 19:27 - Sannidhi Kumar: That's in case nodes are tested during expansion
29/04/2019, 19:28 - Jenit Jain: Accha then yeah sort
29/04/2019, 19:28 - Jenit Jain: No what plan
29/04/2019, 19:30 - Sannidhi Kumar: How much are u done with?
29/04/2019, 19:30 - Sannidhi Kumar: I did half of 14
29/04/2019, 19:31 - Jenit Jain: 2 3 12 13 14
29/04/2019, 19:31 - Jenit Jain: I'll do the rest from divyas notes
29/04/2019, 19:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ohh why not do the textbook?
29/04/2019, 19:48 - Jenit Jain: I know those things decent enough
29/04/2019, 19:48 - Jenit Jain: And Divya reads the text and writes extra notes
29/04/2019, 19:48 - Jenit Jain: She said it's fine 😂
29/04/2019, 19:49 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ohh 😂😂
29/04/2019, 21:12 - Jenit Jain: We don't have algos no
29/04/2019, 21:20 - Sannidhi Kumar: Dont think so
29/04/2019, 22:09 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 22:09 - Sannidhi Kumar: Dude
29/04/2019, 22:09 - Sannidhi Kumar: Why aren't the values of alpha and beta being passed down the tree?
29/04/2019, 22:28 - Jenit Jain: Yeah they aren't updating properly
29/04/2019, 22:36 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah the scheme is completely wrong 😂
29/04/2019, 23:15 - Jenit Jain: In objects and categories what does the rectangle and the double rectangle represent
30/04/2019, 02:12 - Sannidhi Kumar: I think double rectangle is for binary relations..
30/04/2019, 02:13 - Sannidhi Kumar: But both are used when the relations apply to individual objects and not categories
30/04/2019, 05:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: Bro we have agent programs?!
30/04/2019, 06:39 - Sannidhi Kumar: <Media omitted>
30/04/2019, 06:39 - Sannidhi Kumar: What rule did they use here?
30/04/2019, 07:39 - Jenit Jain: There's no retune rule as such
30/04/2019, 07:40 - Jenit Jain: Just normalise so that there probabilities add to 1
30/04/2019, 08:00 - Sannidhi Kumar: How does P(cavity,toothache,catch) = <0.108,0.016>
30/04/2019, 08:00 - Sannidhi Kumar: It should be just 0.108?
30/04/2019, 08:08 - Jenit Jain: The second probability is for ~ cavitiy
30/04/2019, 08:08 - Jenit Jain: We include that too to get both the probabilities in a vector format
30/04/2019, 08:09 - Jenit Jain: They are fusing the above 2 equations
30/04/2019, 08:09 - Jenit Jain: Also did you even sleep wth
30/04/2019, 08:19 - Jenit Jain: Also in the water jug problem, you just try to get the answer through intuition through the graph right
30/04/2019, 08:29 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah ik
30/04/2019, 08:29 - Sannidhi Kumar: But I thought joint probability gives only one value wtf
30/04/2019, 08:29 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ya lol on and off
30/04/2019, 08:29 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yes there are many solutions
30/04/2019, 08:30 - Jenit Jain: Man I'll read it again and see. Think if you don't form a vector also it should be fine
30/04/2019, 08:30 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ok cool
30/04/2019, 08:30 - Sannidhi Kumar: Also did u do completeness of resolution and all?!
30/04/2019, 08:31 - Jenit Jain: Wtf is this
30/04/2019, 08:45 - Sannidhi Kumar: So proof shit
30/04/2019, 08:45 - Sannidhi Kumar: I hope they dont ask all that
30/04/2019, 08:45 - Sannidhi Kumar: *some
30/04/2019, 08:50 - Jenit Jain: Fuck proofs
30/04/2019, 13:17 - Jenit Jain: in proof by refutation you prove kb ^ ~ a is a nullset by being false
30/04/2019, 13:17 - Jenit Jain: and in proof by resolution, you just apply the formula till you get the required 'a' right
30/04/2019, 13:27 - Sannidhi Kumar: I think both are the same?
30/04/2019, 13:27 - Jenit Jain: No no
30/04/2019, 13:28 - Jenit Jain: Also Turing test is acting humanly no
30/04/2019, 13:45 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yes
30/04/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: How was it 🙈🙈🙈
30/04/2019, 17:28 - Sannidhi Kumar: Decent

20/07/2019, 00:32 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yesss
20/07/2019, 11:11 - Sannidhi Kumar: Hello! I'm happy to share that i will also be heading for my masters this year! I had to be hush about it until I got my visa to not affect my chances of continuing work at Microsoft if I didnt - but i got it yday, so i can finally share the news with you all! 
I got acceptances into MS CIS at University of Pennsylvania, MS CS w/ a data science specialization at USC, and Connective Media Cornell Tech which results in a dual degree of MS Information Systems from Cornell University and MS Information Science from Technion. I was the most excited about Connective media - it lets me specialise in data science, work on problems with companies and build products from ground up through the two years. My excitement must have shown since Cornell University gave me a partial scholarship too, and that sealed my decision of picking Cornell Tech. 

Also happy to share that last December i had the chance to go to PACLIC, Hong Kong to present a paper on NLP work i did during my 8th sem. This paper has recently been published by ACL!

If any of you are planning on doing your Masters, or want to explore NLP some more, I'm always open to help! 😊

S:c
E
26/08/2019, 22:31 - Jenit Jain: Letters are less in mice na
26/08/2019, 22:35 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah but why is u mapped to epsilon. Why not someother letter?
26/08/2019, 22:36 - Jenit Jain: I think they are just keeping it as the middle letter
26/08/2019, 22:36 - Jenit Jain: But only o or u can be mapped
26/08/2019, 22:36 - Jenit Jain: So
26/08/2019, 22:42 - Sannidhi Kumar: You could map 'u' to 'c' and 's' to epsilon also right?
26/08/2019, 22:42 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yassss

26/08/2019, 23:47 - Sannidhi Kumar: Q was honestly v weird
26/08/2019, 23:47 - Sannidhi Kumar: Do MBO for police dept
26/08/2019, 23:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: Come up with quantifiable measures for Peter drucker
27/08/2019, 09:46 - Sannidhi Kumar: Are u free for like 5 min, I have doubts in the e insertion transducer
27/08/2019, 09:48 - Jenit Jain: I just woke up so just text
27/08/2019, 09:55 - Sannidhi Kumar: Oh fuck it's too hard to type that out, so basically, I cant understand how the trap state traps "series", "series" could have e insertion also done right?
27/08/2019, 09:55 - Sannidhi Kumar: And similarly even foxes can go to trap state?
27/08/2019, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: According to the fst yes it can. But I think it is not deterministic. And since for normal ones there is a transition epsilon to e, I think all the regular ones follow that path and all the rest go from q2 to q5 when they incur the s in the intermediate state (^s# part)
27/08/2019, 11:10 - Sannidhi Kumar: Ohh ok thanks
27/08/2019, 11:48 - Sannidhi Kumar: What's the 3 level morphology for children?

27/08/2019, 11:57 - Jenit Jain: Her children thing is 100% wrong
27/08/2019, 11:57 - Jenit Jain: It was hw that no one did and she didn't solve it in class
27/08/2019, 11:58 - Jenit Jain: Mapping is always from one letter to another. It can't be d:dren. I'm sure about that
27/08/2019, 11:59 - Sannidhi Kumar: Yeah that's what
27/08/2019, 11:59 - Sannidhi Kumar: That's why i asked
