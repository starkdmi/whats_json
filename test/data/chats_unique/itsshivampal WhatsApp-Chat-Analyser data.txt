4/6/21, 1:48 PM - +91 16 91994: Also from my experience I can share that a lot of times the pronunciation is very similar and is really hard to differentiate, so at the end practice becomes the key and then you'll know when to use which one
4/6/21, 1:49 PM - +91 16 91994: Kind of similar to English, in English also we learn spellings, that's how we know which vowel we have to use.

Korean is indeed difficult but i see as, they are humans too and if they can speak so i can master is too, in sometime.
4/6/21, 3:19 PM - +91 17 26326: Hello everyone! 
I‚Äôm Rhythm from Mumbai. The pandemic somehow got me to give K dramas a shot and I think it may have been one of the best decisions ever. I‚Äôve fallen in love with the language and culture ever since and thus wanna learn Korean to be able to understand it first hand :) I‚Äôve learnt the basics of Hangul from YouTube and wish to improve my vocab and sentence forming for starters. I also discovered this fun application called Drops if you guys wanna try, it‚Äôs a gamified version of learning vocab and one of the best applications I‚Äôve seen for language learning. Looking forward to learning with you guys! :)

Actually what I have understood is that language could be barrier , though they have courses in English as well. Their curriculum is also very different. They teach whole computer science but not specific majors like we have here in India like data science and all. I am targeting only SNU, other universities are not very good in global ranks. snu is amazing tho.
4/6/21, 3:48 PM - +91 60 04528: Hi guys 
Kalyani here from Mumbai. I want to pursue my masters from South Korea because they‚Äôve got some exceptional modules. 
But before that, I‚Äôll have to achieve at least a Level 5 in TOPIK. As my course is partially in Korean. Hence I‚Äôm here to learn the language üòÑ

I‚Äôm a movie buff and have always been intrigued by Korean Cinema! That‚Äôs how I figured out about the courses there.

4/7/21, 9:18 AM - +91 59 59465: Question!! Do we have someone who is teaching and helping us learn or is it just us texting here and getting pdfs. and voice messages.  cause, for me, I need someone to at least lead me into some verbal teachings.
4/7/21, 9:20 AM - +91 18 00680: I think there will be a formal teacher teaching us. Coz that's what was mentioned in the community
4/7/21, 9:21 AM - +91 3 895 054: Yeahhh... I guess we have our mentor
4/7/21, 9:22 AM - +91 64 64951: Me too üíú

4/7/21, 9:25 AM - +91 64 64951: I think it's hwaiting
4/7/21, 9:27 AM - +91 18 00680: Actually hwaiting / fighting is a derived word so neither is actually wrong or rightüòä
4/7/21, 9:28 AM - +91 57 52886: I think it's actually fighting but their pronounce is different
4/7/21, 9:29 AM - +91 64 64951: Ohh i didn't know that bcoz a lot of words are similar to English so I thought its hwaiting and not fighting thanks for letting me know üòä
4/7/21, 9:29 AM - +91 18 00680: Its derived from english and since hangul doesn't have any letter for "f" so its pronounced that way
4/7/21, 9:31 AM - +91 18 00680: So fighting can be written as "ÌååÏù¥ÌåÖ (paiting)" or "ÏôÄÏù¥ÌåÖ (hwaiting)" in hangul
4/7/21, 9:32 AM - +91 18 00680: So in english fighting is hhe word üòÅ
