5/1/17, 12:29 AM - Maqbool Hussain: ایک مزدور اور اس کی بیوی پریشان بیٹھے تھے ۔ بیوی نے پوچھا تم کیوں پریشان ہو ؟ 
مزدور بولا : "میں جن صاحب کی کوٹھی پر مزدوری کر رہا ہوں ، کل ان کی چھٹی ہے۔ جس دن ان کی چھٹی ہوتی ہے ، وہ کوٹھی پر آ کر ایک ایک انچ کا جائزہ لیتے ہیں ، کوئی نقص نکل آے تو ٹھیکیدار ہم مزدوروں کے پیسے کاٹ لیتا ہے ۔ بس یہی پریشانی ہے ۔ ۔ ۔ اور تم بتاؤ تم کیوں پریشان ہو ؟"
بیوی بولی : "جن ڈاکٹر صاحبہ کے گھر میں کام کرتی ہوں ، کل ان کی چھٹی ہے ۔ جس دن ان کی چھٹی ہو اس دن سر پر کھڑے ہو کر کام کرواتی ہیں ۔ کہتی ہیں کہ ایک ایک tile میں تمہاری شکل نظر آنی چاہیے ۔ پتہ نہیں کل کس بات کی چھٹی ہے !"
ان کا چھوٹا بیٹا بولا :" میں بتاتا ہوں ، کل یومِ  مزدور ہے ۔ اس لئے سب بڑے صاحب چھٹی کریں گے!"
مزدور اور اس کی بیوی نے حیرت سے بیٹے کو دیکھا اور پوچھا :"تمہیں کیسے پتہ ؟"
بیٹا بولا : "آج استاد کہہ رہا تھا کہ صبح 7 بجے سروس سٹیشن پہنچ جانا ۔ 7 بجے سے دیر ہوئی تو پسلیاں توڑ دوں گا ۔ کل یومِ  مزدور ہے اور صاحب لوگوں کی چھٹی ہے ، گاڑیوں کا زیادہ رش ہو گا ۔ ۔ ۔ "

5/1/17, 2:30 AM - Aqeel Ibrahim: Love was a lesson we tried to learn
There were no exams to pass or fail
Only heartbreaks
Renew our faith

Life was a lesson we've tried to learn
There were no tests to pass, no license to gain
Only win or lose
Renew our faith

Renew our faith, let us see
Fifties child was right to believe
Peace and love were our needs
The need to be free

War is a lesson we've had to learn
We had to learn to kill, to destroy and burn
But our spirits cry
Renew our faith

Peace is a lesson we've yet to learn
A prize for all mankind who race for the gain
Of love and harmony
Renew our faith

Renew our faith, let us see
Fifties child was right to believe
Peace and love were our needs
The need to be free

Renew our faith, let us see
Young and old we're right to believe
Peace and love are our needs
The need to be free -- Fifties Child, BJH

5/4/17, 4:00 AM - Waseem HS: A newly married couple was walking through a garden, suddenly a dog ran towards them.

They both knew it will bite  them..

The husband lifted his wife and let the dog bite him rather than his sweetheart

The dog stopped before them, unsure what to do, barked a little while and ran away.

The husband put his wife down, expecting a hug and a few kind words of gratitude from her.

But his wife shouted
 "I have seen people throwing stones and sticks at dogs, this is the first time I am seeing someone trying to throw his wife at a dog"!!

Husband...   "😱😱😱😱"

Moral : A Wife is a Wife 

No One ELSE Can MIS-UNDERSTAND a Husband Better, than a Wife.

5/6/17, 6:30 AM - NAVEED AHMAD AWAN HS: 2 black men get onto a bus in New York. They sit down & engage in an animated conversation. 

The lady sitting next 2 them ignores them at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears 1 of them say the following:

"Emma cums first.
Den I cum.
Den two asses cum together.
I cum once-a-more!
2 asses, they cum 2gether again.
I cum again and pee twice.

Then I cum one lasta time."

The lady can't take this any more and shouts "You foul- mouthed sexobsessed Indian, in this country we don't speak aloud in public places about our sex lives however extraordinary they are."

"Hey, coola down lady,' said the man. "Who talkin' about sex?
I'm a justa tellin' my frienda how to spell Mississippi."

 "Azaan in Church"
A Christian  American group are calling for peace and they have chosen Azaan due to its great spiritual effect. They approached an Islamic Centre and asked for someone to go to their church and recite Azaan as part of their annual ceremony in a very big cathedral. A young man was nominated and he said he hesitated a great deal and performed Istikhara prayer then agreed to take part and attend the ceremony.
He says: Azaan had a great impact on them, they were stunned and as soon as I finished, many of them followed me outside the church leaving the ceremony. 
They cried and asked me to translate Azaan that had had a great impact on their souls.

5/6/17, 12:36 PM - Asif Iqbal HS: Michael Hart, The author of the book: " The 100 most influential people ", that took him 28 years to complete. He ranked Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon Him) number one on the list.

He was giving a lecture in London, he was booed and interrupted. People were complaining why he ranked the Prophet number one.

He said:" The Prophet Mohammad stood in the middle of Makkah in the year 611, he said to the people :"I am the Prophet of Allah". 

Four people believed in him, his best friend, his wife and two kids! 

Now, even after 1400 years, The number of Muslims has gone over 1 billion and still expanding, He could not have been a liar, because a lie will not last 1400 years, nor could you fool 1 billion people.
Another thing, even after all this time, millions of Muslims will not hesitate to sacrifice their lives over one word that would hurt their Prophet.

Is there one Christian willing to do that for Jesus?

After that there was dead silence in the whole auditorium.

5/9/17, 5:05 AM - Waseem HS: 1990 میں صدر غلام اسحاق خان نے اپنے صدارتی اختیار 58 ٹو بی کو استعمال کرتے ہوئے بے نظیر بھٹو کی حکومت کو کرپشن کے الزامات کے تحت برطرف کر دیا۔ نواز شریف نے صدر کے اس 
اقدام کا بھرپور انداز میں خیر مقدم کیا۔

1993 میں صدر غلام اسحاق خان نے اپنے اسی اختیار کو دوبارہ استعمال کرتے ہوئے کرپشن کے 
الزمات کے تحت ہی نواز شریف کی حکومت ہٹانے اور اسمبلیاں توڑنے کا حکم جاری کیا تو نواز 
شریف نے صدر کا یہ حکم ماننے سے انکار کر دیا۔

نواز شریف نے صدر کے اس حکم کو سپریم کورٹ میں چیلنج کر دیا اور سپریم کورٹ نے 26 مئی 
1993 کو اپنا ایک انتہائی متنازع فیصلہ سنایا جس میں وضاحت کی کہ کرپشن اور بیڈ گورننس سے 
آئین شکنی نہیں ہوتی لہذا صدر مذکورہ صورتوں میں اسمبلیاں نہیں توڑ سکتے۔
ایوان صدر اور نواز شریف کے درمیان تنازع جاری رہا جس پر باالآخر پاک فوج نے مداخلت کی اور 
دونوں سےا ستعفی لے کر معاملہ ختم کر دیا۔

1997 میں نواز شریف دوسری بار ملک کے وزیراعظم بنے تو اس نے فوری طور پر 14ویں آئینی ترمیم کرتے ہوئے صدر کی اسمبلیاں توڑنے کا اختیار ختم کر دیا۔ اس آئینی ترمیم کے بعد وزیراعظم کسی کے سامنے جوابدہ نہ رہے۔ نواز شریف نے مزکورہ آئینی ترمیم میں ایسی شقیں ڈالیں جس کے بعد پارلمنٹ بھی اس کی مرضی کے خلاف کوئی فیصلہ کرنے کے قابل نہ رہی۔
کچھ اراکین پارلیمنٹ نے اس آئینی تریم کے خلاف سپریم کورٹ سے رجوع کیا۔ سپریم کورٹ نے 
درخواست سماعت کے لیے منظور کر لی تو نواز شریف سخت طیش میں آگئے اور کھل کر سپریم 
کورٹ پر تنقید کی۔ جس پر سپریم کورٹ نے ان کو توہین عدالت کا نوٹس بھیجا۔

حالات خراب ہوتے دیکھ کر صدر پاکستان اور پاک فوج کے اس وقت کے سربراہ نواز شریف کو 
سمجھانے آئے اور درخواست کی کہ اس معاملے کو اچھے طریقے سے حل کریں۔ نواز شریف نے 
ضد کی کہ " چیف جسٹس سجاد علی شاہ کو اپنا عہدہ چھوڑنا ہوگا" ۔ ساتھ ہی نہایت جارحانہ انداز میں نہ صرف سپریم کورٹ میں اپنے مرضی کے ججز تعینات کرنے شروع کر دئیے بلکہ جسٹس سجاد علی شاہ کے قریب سمجھے جانے والے ججوں کی تنزلی بھی کر دی۔ جن ججوں کی تنزلی ہوئی 
انہوں نےنواز شریف کے اس حکم کے خلاف کوئٹہ ھائی کورٹ میں اپیل کر دی اور بہت سے ججز 
چیف جسٹس سجاد علی شاہ کے ساتھ کھڑے ہوگئے۔ 
اسی دوران پشاور ھائی کورٹ سے ان دو ججز کی معزولی کا حکم آگیا جنکی تنزلی ہوئی تھی اور 
پشاور ھائی کورٹ کے چیف جسٹس سعید الزماں صدیقی نے خود کو سپریم کورٹ کا عبوری 
چیف جسٹس قرار دےد یا۔
تاہم چیف جسٹس سجاد علی شاہ اپنی کرسی پر موجود رہے اور نواز شریف کے خلاف کیس کی
سماعت جاری رکھی جس پر 30 نومبر 1997 کو عین اس وقت جب کیس کی سماعت جاری تھی نواز شریف کے کیبنٹ کے وزراء اور بہت بڑی تعداد میں پارٹی اراکین نے سپریم کورٹ پر حملہ کر دیا 
اور عدالتی کاروائی روک دی۔

چیف جسٹس نے پاک فوج سے مدد طلب کرتے ہوئے فورا 14 ویں آئینی ترمیم کو منسوخ کر دیا اور 
صدر کے اختیارات بحال کر دئیے۔ پاک فوج نے حالات کی نزاکت کو دیکھتے ہوئے چیف جسٹس کا
یہ حکم ماننے سے معذوری ظاہر کی۔ نواز شریف نے فوری طور پر صدر فاروق لغاری کو استعفی 
دینے پر مجبور کر دیا اور وسیم سجاد کو عبوری صدر مقرر کرتے ہوئے چیف جسٹس سجاد علی 
شاہ کو برطرف کر دیا۔
یوں نہ صرف اپنی مرضی کا صدر مقرر کیا بلکہ سپریم کورٹ میں بھی اپنی مرضی کے ججز تعئنات 
کرنے میں کامیاب ہوگئے۔

جنرل جہانگیر کرامت جنرل وحید کاکڑ کی جگہ نئے چیف آف آرمی سٹاف مقرر ہوئے۔ انکی مدت
ملازمت جنوری 1999 میں ختم ہونی تھی۔ لیکن نیشنل سیکورٹی کاؤنسل میں پاک فوج کا نمائندہ شامل کرنے کی تجویز پر نواز شریف نے غضب ناک ہو کر اکتوبر 1998 میں جنرل جہانگیر کرامت سے 
زبردستی استعفی لے لیا۔ پھر کئی جنرلز کی سینیارٹی کو نظر انداز کرتے ہوئے پرویز مشرف کو 
چیف آف آرمی سٹاف بنا دیا۔
پاک فوج نے نواز شریف کے اس فیصلے کو خاموشی سے برداشت کر لیا۔

لیکن کارگل جنگ میں پسپائی کے فیصلے کے بعد پاک فوج اور نواز شریف میں موجود سرد مہری 
نے باقاعدہ اختلافات کی شکل اختیار کر لی۔ نواز شریف کے اس فیصلے نے ایک جیتی ہوئی جنگ
ہروا دی۔

اسی سال 1999 میں نواز شریف نے پاک فوج کے ان جوانوں کی لاشیں قبول کرنے کے انکار کر دیا 
جو افغان جنگ میں طالبان کا ساتھ دیتے ہوئے شہید ہوئے تھے۔ اس پر پورے ملک خاص کر پاکستان
کے مغربی علاقوں میں پرزور احتجاج ہوا۔ نواز شریف نے دباؤ میں آکر وہ لاشیں قبول کر لیں لیکن 
ساتھ ہی حکم جاری کیا کہ پاک فوج ملا عمر کی امداد بند کر دے۔ پرویز مشرف نے نواز شریف کا 
حکم ماننے سے انکار کر دیا اور ملا عمر کی امداد جاری رکھنے کا فیصلہ کیا۔ 
پاک فوج کے ساتھ معاملات مزید خراب گئے۔

اگست 1999 میں دو انڈین ائر کرافٹس نے پاکستانی نیوی جہاز مار گرایا جس میں نیوی کے 16
افیسرز شہید ہوگئے۔ نواز شریف نے معاملے کو نظر انداز کر دیا۔ اپنے وزیراعظم کی اس بے حسی نے نیوی پر بہت برا اثر ڈاال اور اس وقت کے نیوی ایڈمرل عبد العزیز مرزا بھی نواز شریف کے 
خلاف ہوگئے۔

پاک فوج پر قابو پانے کے لیے نواز شریف نے 12 اکتوبر 1999 کو اس وقت کے آرمی چیف پرویز 
مشرف کو برطرف کر کے ان کی جگہ پر اپنے وفادار جنرل ضیاالدین بٹ کو لگانے کی کوشش کی۔ 
اس وقت جنرل مشرف سری لنکا دورے سے واپسی پر تھے اور انکا جہاز ہوا میں تھا۔ نواز شریف
نے حکم جاری کیا کہ کراچی ائر پورٹ مذکورہ جہاز کے لیے سیل کر دیا جائے۔ لینڈنگ کی صورت
میں اس وقت کے آئی جی سندھ کو آرمی چیف کو گرفتار کرنے کا حکم جاری کیا۔ 
جہاز کے کیپٹن نے ری فیولنگ کے لیے نواب شاہ ائرپورٹ پر اترنے کی اجازت مانگی تو نواز 
شریف نے حکم جاری کیا کہ یہ ری فیولنگ انڈیا میں کروائی جائے۔ یوں پاکستان کے حاضر سروس
چیف آف آرمی سٹاف کو انڈیا بھیجنے تک پر تیار ہوگئے۔

پاک فوج کے ساتھ جاری اس خطرناک کھیل پر باالاخر پاک فوج کے کئی اعلی جرنیلوں نے بغاوت 
کردی اور نہ صرف جنرل ضیاالدین بٹ کو گرفتار کر لیا بلکہ ملک کی کئی اہم عمارات کا کنٹرول 
بھی سنبھال لیا اور جہاز کو کراچی ائر پورٹ پر اترنے کا حکم دے دیا۔ جس کے بعد پرویز مشرف
نے پورے ملک میں مارشل لاءنافذ کرنے کا اعلان کر دیا۔

یہ نواز شریف کو وہ ماضی ہے جس کو مٹایا نہیں جا سکتا۔ اقتدار کی حوس میں وہ اپنے ہی ملک کے 
ریاستی اداروں کے خالف مسلسل برسرپیکار رہے اور ہر حد عبور کر لی۔ 
نواز شریف کی یہ ھوسناک جنگ آج بھی جاری ہے جسکا مشاہدہ اس وقت پوری قوم کر رہی ہے۔ تاہم 
یہ جنگ لڑنے کے لیے اس کے پاس جھوٹ، مکر، چالبازی، فریب اور دھوکے کے سوا کچھ نہیں۔ امید ہے کہ اس بار یہ جنگ فیصلہ کن ہوگی !

5/9/17, 8:26 AM - Ahmer Baig HS: It is very unlikely that we will ever be able to voyage into outer space & see the wonders of the universe the way future space travelers will.

 For us the next best experience would be a long night flight.However, from the inside of an aircraft cabin you will not see much & more often than not most passengers sleep.

 The pilots in the flight deck are lucky as they get to see the night sky like no one else.If one could create a time lapse video from the cockpit during a long night flight it would be simply awesome.Magical in fact.

 A Boeing 777 pilot did just that! On a flight from Zurich to Sao Paolo in South America this creative Senior First Officer created an amazing time lapse video as his plane flew over three continents.Keeping him company is the Milky Way,millions of stars & meteors of the Perseid Meteor shower.

During the flight he switches on the landing lights to greet pilots of other flights as they shoot by over head.

The accompanying music is perfect.

The pilot shot the sequences using a Sony A7S camera which has very high ISO ratings.He also used a fast f 1.4 lens.To shoot a time lapse like this from the cockpit of a plane travelling at near the speed of sound is simply amazing.

5/10/17, 11:12 AM - Saifullah Uae: Joke of the year 
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Made me laugh:

Two beggars in London

Ali and Habib are beggars.
They beg in different areas of London ...

Habib begs just as long as Ali does,  but only collects £2 to £3 every day.

Ali brings home a suitcase FULL of £10 notes, drives a Mercedes, lives in a mortgage-free house and has a lot of money to spend.

Habib asks Ali :-
'I work just as long and hard as you do but how is it that you bring home a suitcase full of £10 notes every day?'

Ali says, 'Look at your sign, what does it say'?

Habib's sign reads
'I have no work, a wife and 6 kids to support'.

Ali  says No wonder you only get £2- £3

Habib says... 'So what does your sign say'?

Ali shows Habib his sign....
It reads,

'I only need another £10 to move back to Pakistan'.

5/11/17, 11:28 AM - mashood yunus: stick up a thumb, if you had one of such lovely "Rambo" fathers ... (my mother is also a "Rambo" mother and I was the oldest hence stuck with them as they "worked hard" to make me the role model oldest child so other kids remain "seedhay".  I made sure the "hard work" was passed on to my 5 siblings - complete with details and styles (which mukka should be launched at what angle of the face) 😈😈😈
5/11/17, 11:30 AM - mashood yunus: 👍🏿  here is my thumb :)  lovely lovely parents with awesome memories.  so glad I was beaten on a regular basis 🤣
5/11/17, 11:30 AM - Imran Farhat HS: ایک مسلمان حج کرکے آیا تو سیدھے اپنے محلے کی دکان پر گیا اور دکاندار کو کہا کہ میرا کھاتہ نکالو۔
دکاندار بہت خوش ہوگیا کہ شاید اس کے تین سال کے ادھار ملنے والے ہیں ۔
جونہی اس نے کھاتہ کھولا تو مسلمان نے کہا  " میرے نام کے ساتھ حاجی لکھ دو۔"😂😂😂😂
5/11/17, 11:30 AM - mashood yunus: uf :)  I am rolling all over the floor and it is a sight to behold!
5/11/17, 11:32 AM - Ziad asghar: When you mention your past, how can you not mention a certain sridevi???
5/11/17, 11:48 AM - mashood yunus: I cann't hear you, I cannot read and I am not responding (I cannot believe, I am responding)
5/11/17, 11:50 AM - mashood yunus: and also because for most past, the crush was hidden from parents (or so I thought).  mil gayaa chaen khabees aadmi ...   since you were my neighbor, I have every reason to believe, some of my Abu's beatings were because of you "filling his ears"
5/11/17, 11:51 AM - Ziad asghar: If they don't know, we can still tell them..

5/11/17, 5:45 PM - Aqeel Ibrahim: When this beatup is considered pyaar then that leads to severe issues later in life..
5/11/17, 5:46 PM - Aqeel Ibrahim: Beatup can accompany pyaar...the correct way. .. problem happens when beatup is the only channel of communication
5/11/17, 5:50 PM - mashood yunus: No comments. Saif, i am closing this topic here. It is going in some other direction now

اے میرےالله اپنے پیارے حبیبﷺ کے صدقے جس نے مجھے یہ دُعا بھیجی ہے اُس کے تمام گُناہوں کو معاف فرما اور ہر کام میں کامیابی عطا فرما اور اُس کا نَصیب کھول دے۔ اٰمئین!
اپنے لئے ضرور دُعا کرؤایں نجانے کس کی زبان سے آپ کی تقدیر کھول جائے۔ 
نوٹ: آج کے دِن اگر یہ دُعا آگے فارورڈ نہ کر سکیں تو واپس مجھے ہی بھیج دیں۔

5/15/17, 7:20 AM - Imran Farhat HS: I love this Story, this is the funniest thing I'm reading this week! 😂😂😂😂😂😂

A woman went shopping. At the cash counter, she opened her purse to pay.

The cashier noticed a TV remote in her purse.

He could not control his curiosity and asked,

"Do you always carry your TV remote with you?😕"

She replied " No, not always, but my husband refused to accompany me shopping today because of football match, so I took the remote."

*Moral: Accompany and support your wife in her hobbies.....*🙍🙍🙍🙍🙍🙍🙍

The story continues....😏

The cashier laughed and then returned all the items that lady had purchased.

Shocked at this act, she asked the cashier what he was doing.

He said, "your husband has blocked your credit card.........."😲😲😲😲😲😲

*MORAL: Always respect the hobbies of your husband.*😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒

Story continues....

Wife took out her husband's credit card from purse and swiped it. Unfortunately he didn't block his own card.

*Moral: Don't underestimate the power and wisdom of your WIFE..*

Story continues...

After swiping, the machine indicated, 'ENTER THE PIN SENT TO YOUR MOBILE PHONE'.......

*Moral: When a man tends to lose, the machine is smart enough to save him!*

Story continues....

She smiled to herself and reached out for the mobile which rang in her purse.

It was her husband's phone showing the forwarded SMS.

She had taken it with the remote control so he doesn't call her during her shopping.

She bought her items and returned home happily.

*Moral: Don't underestimate a desperate woman!*😷😷😷😷😷

Story continues....

On getting home, his car was gone.😈😈😈😈😈

A note was pasted on the door

"Couldn't find the remote. Gone out with the boys to watch the premiership match. Will be home late. Call me on my phone if you need something".😇😇😇😇

Dawn... He left with the house key too.

😂😂😂😂

*Moral: Don't try to control your husband.
You will always lose😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯

Don't laugh alone. Please share

Hijr and Hijrat on unprecedented levels in/from Muslim lands. Only careful handling produces Heroes. Otherwise pure madness. Ummah and its Ulema are the most cluless ever in History. Allah help us all. The Great Deceiver is in action.

5/17/17, 4:24 PM - HS saqib Kamran: طویل بیس سال بعد  کسی نا مانوس نمبر سے اس کی کال آئی تھی. لائن پر مسلسل خاموشی اور دبی دبی سسکیوں سے میں نے اس کو پہچان لیا تھا. اس کی آخری کال بھی سسکیوں اور ہچکیوں کے درمیان ختم ہوئی تھی. اور آج دو عشرے گزرنے بعد بھی میں نے انہی ہچکیوں اور سسکیوں سے اس کو فوری پہچان لیا تھا. 
میرا دل انتہائی  شدت سے دھڑکنے لگا تھا گویا کہ آج وہ پسلیوں کے پنجرے سے رہائی پا لے گا. وسوسوں اور اندیشوں کے عجیب سے سنپولیے میرے دل میں رینگنے لگے اور میں ان لمحوں کو یاد کرنے لگا جب آخری بار میں نے اس کے ہاتھ اپنے ہاتھ میں لے کر وعدہ لیا تھا کہ وہ مجھے بھول جائے گی اور خود کو حالات کے سپرد کر دے گی کہ اسی میں ہم دونوں کے خاندان کی عزت اور بھلائی تھی. اور اس نے میری بات مان لی اور دو عشرے ایسے گزرگئے تھے کہ گویا وقت کی ایک ہی کروٹ میں سما گئے تھے اور آج؟
آج جب وقت اور حالات کی قید سے فرار ہو کر اس نے مجھے کال کر دی تھی تو اندیشوں کے ایک طوفان نے مجھے جکڑ لیا تھا. 
کیا اب زندگی کی وہ قربانی جو ہم نے ایک دوسرے کے لیے دی تھی ضائع ہونے والی تھی؟ کیا وہ حالات سے بغاوت کا اعلان کرنے والی تھی؟ کیا ہماری بمشکل سنبھلی زندگی میں کوئی اور افتاد آنے والی تھی؟
یہ سوچ سوچ کر میری روح تک دکھنے لگ گئی تھی اور سسکیوں کی بلند ہوتی آواز میری نسوں پر برق بن کر گرنے لگی تھی. مجھے شدید گھٹن اور حبس کا احساس ہونے لگا, جسم پر کپکپی طاری ہو گئی اور میں نے اپنے ہی پسینے میں تر بتر ہو کر پنکھے کے بٹن کی طرف ہاتھ بڑھایا تو یاد آیا کہ بجلی حسبِ معمول صبح سے گئی تھی اور کسی بے وفا کی طرح ابھی لوٹ کر نہیں آئی تھی. 
مجھے اب سسکیوں کے درمیان ہچکیوں کی آواز سنائی دینا شروع ہو گئی اور میرا دل اچھل کر حلق میں آ گیا. آخر میں نے بمشکل ہمت مجتمع کی اور فقط اتنا ہی کہہ پایا،

" پینو آخر ہویا کی اے؟ کجھ بول تے سہی"

(What happened peeno? At least say something.")

اس نے ہچکیوں کے درمیان کہا،

" وے بشیریا میں تیری اک گل منی سی، تینوں میرا واسطہ توویں میری اک گل من لئیں"

اور یہی وہ لمحہ تھا جو میرے لئیے اعصاب شکن ثابت ہو سکتا تھا. اور یہیں مجھے اپنے آپ کو سنبھالنا تھا. میں نے دیوار کا سہارا لے کرایک لمبا سانس لیا، دل پر ہاتھ رکھ کر خود کو آنے والی افتاد کیلئے تیار کیا, تھوک نگل کر گلے کو تر کیا اور فقط اتنا ہی کہہ پایا،

"بول پینو!"

دوسری طرف چند ثانیے کے لیے بالکل ایسی گھمبیر خاموشی چھا گئی جیسے کسی طوفان سے پہلے چھا جاتی ہے اور اس کے درمیان اسکی منمناتی ہوئی التجا بلند ہوئی،

"ایس واری گنجیاں نوں ووٹ ناں دیویں"

میں ہیلو ہیلو کرتا رہ گیا مگر شاید اب مزید بیس سال کے لیے لائن خاموش ہو چکی تھی.۔۔۔😜😜😜

5/18/17, 5:47 AM - ‪+92 300 9506088‬: رزق کے چار دروازے ہیں۔ پہلے تین تو صرف مسلمانوں کے لیے ہیں اور چوتھا ساری دنیا کے لیے ہے یعنی مسلم، غیر مسلم ، بت پرست ، دہریے وغیرہ

رزق حاصل کرنے کا سب سے پہلا دروازہ نماز ہے۔ جو شخص بھی نماز کا اہتمام کرتا ہے اللہ پاک اس کو برکت والا رزق عطا فرماتے ہیں۔ اہتمام یہ ہے کہ نماز کے وقت سے پہلے یا وقت ہوتے ہی اس کی تیاری میں لگ جانا اور وقت پر نماز ادا کرنا۔

رزق حاصل کرنے کا دوسرا دروازہ استغفار ہے۔ جو شخص کثرت سے استغفار کرتا ہے اللہ پاک اسے غیب سے رزق عطا فرماتے ہیں کیونکہ ایک حدیث کا مفہوم ہے کہ جو کثرت سے استغفار کرتا ہے اللہ پاک اسے ہر غم سے نجات عطا فرماتے ہیں، ہر پریشانی میں راستہ دیتے ہیں اور ایسی جگہ سے رزق عطا فرماتے ہیں کہ جہاں اس کا گمان بھی نہ ہو۔ علماء کرام فرماتے ہیں کہ کثرت کا مطلب ہے کہ کم از کم تین سو مرتبہ۔ تو جو روزانہ تین سو سے زیادہ مرتبہ استغفار کرے گا ان شاءاللہ اسے بہترین رزق ملے گا.

رزق حاصل کرنے کا تیسرا دروازہ تقویٰ ہے۔ تقویٰ کے معنی گناہوں سے بچنا ہے۔ یاد رہے کہ مسلمان کے ذمہ ہر نیکی کرنا نہیں ہے لیکن ہر گناہ سے بچنا ہر مسلمان کے لیے لازم ہے۔ جو ہر گناہ سے بچتا ہے وہ اللہ کے ہاں متقی کہلاتا ہے۔ اس کا آسان طریقہ یہ ہے کہ ہم ہر کام کرنے سے پہلے یہ دیکھ لیں کہ اس کام سے اللہ اور اللہ کے رسول صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے منع تو نہیں فرمایا۔ اگر منع فرمایا ہے تو ہم رک جائیں تو جو تقویٰ اختیار کرے گا اللہ پاک اسے بغیر محنت کے رزق عطا فرمائیں گے۔ جو اللہ کا ہوجاتا ہے تو پھر اللہ اپنے بندوں کو اسکی خدمت پر مامور فرمادیتے ہیں۔

رزق حاصل کرنے کا چوتھا دروازہ ذریعہ معاش اختیار کرنا ہے اور یہ دروازہ سب کے لیے ہے، کوئی کافر ہو یا مسلم، بتوں کو پوجنے والا ہو یا آتش پرست۔ اگر وہ معاش کا کوئی ذریعہ اختیار کرے گا تو اللہ اسے رزق عطا فرمائیں گے۔

مجھے افسوس اس بات پر ہے کہ مسلمانوں کی اکثریت نے پہلے تین دروازے بھلا دیے اور آخری دروازے کو ہی لازمی سمجھ لیا۔ جبکہ ان تین دروازوں سے رزق حاصل کرنا بہت آسان ہے.یہاں کوئی میری بات سے یہ مطلب نہ لے کہ ملازمت ، کاروبار یا معاش کا کوئی بھی دوسرا ذریعہ جو ہم نے اختیار کیا ہوا ہے اسے چھوڑ کر بیٹھ جائیں اور کام نہ کریں۔ کام ضرور کریں لیکن اگر ہم چوتھے دروازے کے ساتھ ساتھ پہلے تین دروازوں کو بھی استعمال کریں گے تو ہم تھوڑی محنت میں ہی زیادہ رزق ملے گا۔ ہماری مشقت کم ہوجائے گی۔ اور ہماری کمائی غیر ضروری جگہوں پر نہیں لگے گی اور ہمارا مال ضائع نہیں ہوگا .گھر میں رکھی ہوئی مرغی کو آپ اس کی خوراک ایک جگہ برتن میں رکھ کر دے دیں تو وہ کم وقت اور کم مشقت میں اپنا پیٹ بھر لے گی اور اگر وہی خوراک آپ پورے صحن میں بکھیر دیں تو اسے وہی خوراک حاصل کرنے کے لیے وقت بھی زیادہ لگے گا اور مشقت بھی
۔
اب فیصلہ آپ پر ہے کہ آپ کس دروازے کو اختیار کرتے ہیں ؟

5/18/17, 11:17 AM - Saifullah Uae: ایک بادشاہ کے پاس 12 انچ کا گھوڑا تھاجس کی شہرت دور دورتک تھی. ایسا محیرالعقول جانور. ایک دن وزیر نے پوچھ ہی لیا کہ عالم پناہ ایسی نادر شے کہاں سے ملی. بادشاہ نے رازداری سے بتایا کہ قبرستان کے قریب ایک بزرگ ہیں ان سے جو مانگو وہ دعا دیتے ہیں اور عجیب سے عجیب مانگ پوری ہو جاتی ہے. بس ایک مراد مانگنے کی اجازت ہوتی ہے. اور وہ بزرگ ذرا اونچا سنتے ہیں 

وزیر نے سوچا بادشاہ لوگ تو آدھے پاگل ہی ہوتے ہیں میں کوئی کام کی چیز مانگ آتا ہوں وہ گیا اور بزرگ سے مانگا 
 حضرت ایک بوری ہیرے کی عطا ہو جائے
 حضرت نے دعا کی اور غیب سے ایک بوری "زیرے" کی آگئی
 وزیر بڑا سٹپٹایا کہ مانگا ہیرا اور مل گیا زیرا...بزرگ کے بوڑھے کانوں کو گالیاں دیتا بادشاہ کے پاس پہنچا
 جہاں پناہ ہیرا مانگا مگر بڈھے بابا کے کان ستیاناس ہوں زیرا دے دیا!!"

بادشاہ نے ٹھنڈی آہ بھری 
"کیوں بے تیرے خیال میں میں نے 12 انچ کا گھوڑا مانگا تھا؟"

مارکیٹ میں ایک عورت کو دونوں ہاتھوں میں بھر بھر کے مہندی لگوانے کے بعد یاد آیا کہ وہ  کار پر اکیلے آئی ہے، اور واپس کس طرح جائے گی.
.
وہ پریشان کھڑی تھی کہ، تبھی اس کے ایک پڑوسی نے اسے پہچان لیا اور پھر اسی کی  کار میں اسے گھر تک چھوڑ دیا.
.
گھر پہنچنے پر پڑوسی کو یاد آیا کہ ، وہ اپنی کار اور بیوی دونوں کو تو، مارکیٹ میں ہی چھوڑ آیا ہے  !!!!

5/22/17, 4:29 AM - Aqeel Ibrahim: "میرا دل چاہتا ہے
گالیوں کی ایک قمیص تیار کروں
اور ان جذامی مجسموں کو پہنا دوں
جو ہمارے دارالحکومتوں کے قلب میں نصب کر دیے گئے ہیں

نجاست کے یہ مینار
خون آشام چمگادڑوں کے کابک ہیں
اور ایسی آوازوں سے بھرے ہوئے ہیں
جو کسبیوں کے رحم میں گونجتی ہیں

مگر میں کیا کروں
گالیاں بوئی نہیں جاتیں
انہیں کاتا نہیں جا سکتا
اور مجھے خیاطی بھی نہیں آتی ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔
انسان نے اگر صحیح سمت میں ترقی کی ہوتی
تو مجھے ان مجبوریوں کا سامنا نہ کرنا پڑتا
جن کی وجہ سے میری نفرت بانجھ عورتوں کی طرح
ایک خود سوزہ شعلہ بن کر رہ گئی ہے ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔

مجھے ایک آتش فشاں پہاڑ کی تلاش ہے
میں اسے شہد کے چھتّے کی طرح نچوڑوں گا
اور اس کا سارا لاوا ان ایوانوں پر انڈیل دوں گا
جہاں چھپکلیاں فائلوں پر دستخط کرتی ہیں
اور بھیڑیے قوم سے خطاب کرتے ہیں

میں ایک بھونچال بھی ڈھونڈ رہا ہوں
اُن دیواروں پر دے مارنے کے لیے
جن کے پیچھے غلامی کی تاج پوشی ہوتی ہے
اور غداری کو سلامی دی جاتی ہے ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔

کاش یہ چیزیں مجھے جلدی مِل جائیں
ورنہ ریاض اور کویت ہم نسب گیدڑوں کا بیت الخلا بن جائیں گے
دوحہ اور بحرین امریکیوں کے زخم سے ابلتی پیپ میں بہہ جائیں گے
میں اُس دن کے سُورج کو روکنے نکلا ہوں
جو تمہیں دِکھانے آ رہا ہے
قاہرہ اور عمان پر حکومت کرنے والے چوہوں کو
طاعون کا فرمان جاری کرتے ہوئے
بغداد اور تہران کے مسند نشین کوّوں کو
متروک قبرستان میں جفتی کرتے ہوئے
دمشق اور اسلام آباد میں مبروص بوزنوں کو
صدارت کا حلف اُٹھاتے ہوئے۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔

میں سوچتا ہوں آوازیں جمع کر لوں
لیکن زمین پر زیادہ آوازیں دستیاب نہیں
اور جو ہیں ان میں منمناہٹ بہت ہے
ویسے بھی مٹّی کو بولنے یا چیخنے کی مشق نہیں ہے
مجھے تو ایسی آوازوں کی ضرورت ہے
جن میں میرا غصہ پورا سما جائے
جو میری آگ کو خیانت کے بغیر
میرے دشمنوں تک پہنچا دے
ایسی قتال آوازوں کے لیے
مجھے کئی سیارے چھاننے ہوں گے
مگر کہیں یہ نہ ہو کہ آوازوں کا ایک جہنم اٹھائے
میں واپس آؤں
تو اس وقت تک یہ بے شرم کباڑیے
سماعت کا بھی سودا کر چکے ہوں”

You have granted me the honor and privilege of talking to you directly, Have you given this privilege to any other person? Allah Ta'ala replied, O!! Moosa during the last period I am going to send an ummat, who will be the Ummat of Mohammed (SAW) with dry lips, parched tongues, emaciated body with eyes sunken deep into their sockets, with livers dry and stomachs suffering the pangs of hunger- will call out to me (in dua) they will be much much closer to me than you O Moosa! while you speak to me there are 70000 veils between you and me but at the time of iftaar there will not be a single veil between me and the fasting Ummat of Mohammed (SAW) O!! Moosa I have taken upon myself the responsibility that at the time of iftaar I will never refuse the dua of a fasting person!

5/23/17, 2:12 AM - Aqeel Ibrahim: The life of Umar Farooq RA is a beacon of hope for the people who were love deprived (like Umar from his dad). Anger frustration depression self-loathing, extreme views and fear of abandonment were all characteristics of Umar RA before Islam. His anger continued until he became a Khalifa. He became a LEGEND beyond that point.
5/23/17, 2:13 AM - Aqeel Ibrahim: Today average Muslim person is angry and frustrated. They blame it on the circumstances of the World. What they do not know is that this is pent-up anger from childhood.
5/23/17, 2:18 AM - Aqeel Ibrahim: <Media omitted>
5/23/17, 2:48 AM - Aqeel Ibrahim: If you are still wondering what Umar RA is referring to here then here it is. He is referring to the harsh controlling love deprived environment that he went through under his dad. And now he was a Khalifa with no one between him and Allah. Control issues lead to anger.
LOVE your children. Dont control them with anger.

*Reintroducing Ramadan to children*

🌱Children learn more from our actions rather than our words. We need to discuss the importance of the Holy Month of Ramadan with them, and the blessings and benefits it brings.

🌱Teach them that Ramadan is a time for spiritual cleansing, so we must make a great effort to enhance our spirituality.

🌱Help them realize that fasting in Ramadan is not only to refrain from eating and drinking, but much more than that...

*We must be careful not to make Ramadan seem like a burden to them, or a difficult task that they start fearing.*

🌱Our job is only to water and nurture these flower buds; we must let them blossom in the open air of faith, and experience the beauty of Islam themselves. Along with that, we must constantly make extensive duas for them, and for ourselves, that we are all able to achieve a fruitful Ramadan. InshaaAllah.

5/24/17, 7:34 PM - IMRAN SOHAIL HS: By Lt Gen Tariq Khan (retd)

Have been away for a while, was watching matters with concern and disappointment as Pakistan stumbles through one crisis to another. But then am I qualified to say anything at all in the first place? A retired officer of the armed forces, it appears may have no right to criticize, suggest or recommend anything within this sacred democracy. If he does it’s immediately considered a call for ‘Martial Law.’ On the other hand, people such Asma Jehangir, generalize their opinion and call us ‘duffers’, in other words, brainless people who do not have the right to an opinion in the first place. So am I missing the point on account of my lack of intellectual capacity and all that I see are just illusions and that matters are in fact all honkey dory in the Islamic Lands of Pakistan, that I should neither be concerned nor have the right to be concerned? Is that how I am supposed to spend the rest of my life being lectured by their wisdom and their logic as they preach ‘sanity, peace and harmony’? I have listened to the animated arguments of those who wish to befriend India at any cost while their silence on Kashmir at the same time astounds me; I have heard those who want to ‘leave’ Afghanistan alone but suggest no resolution to the our TTP sitting in Kunar or continued Afghan insinuations on the Western Border. It seems that we are always wrong that here is nothing right in what we do. The same people who cried hoarse accusing Musharaf of buckling under US pressure are silent as the Ummah prostitutes itself in a public display of selling body and soul to Trump. I wonder what one would say to the troops today when going into battle to be prepared to lay down their lives for this country. This is probably the only domain where I can claim qualification. So what would one say? Should our men fight and die so that Qadri can be freely celebrated as a murderer or that Mullah Azizi can announce the anniversary of when they shot and killed an officer of the Armed Forces in broad daylight in the Capital of this Country? Should he die for what he is publically accused of by Dawn or for a government that is under trial by a JIT for robbing him, for the linesman who steals his electricity or the DC who lords over him? For a CJ Mr Chaudry and his son or for the land mafia that encroach on his lands, for Dar who exploits his own people as he searches how he can still tax those who pay taxes and protect those who don’t, for ministers who cannot hold a commitment for more than 24 hours; for the liars, cheats, thieves who surround us in every walk of life. Tell me, what will you tell your troops today, lay down their life for what – for this?  

In Saudia, Pakistan appeared like a bride with her trousseau ready, waiting for the first suiter to woe her. With nothing to say, and no contribution, Pakistan sat on the fringes of the coalition hoping a scrap would be thrown her way too. As India was celebrated in the wake of the Kashmir genocide, Pakistan’s sacrifices were trampled upon as a warning was read out to those who aid and abet terrorists on their lands. I wonder who all qualify for such a warning. So how do you motivate your men today – fight the American devil or the Arab?

With dire threats to Iran, the Coalition cannot pretend it is anything else but a sectarian alliance and we with our ‘duffers’ stupidity are in the lead. Though we have no dog in this fight, we have jumped in with glee. I suppose for the apologists of the Ummah, ‘this is our war’ and they have finally found the right war to fight having fought the wrong one for the last so many years. So what should we tell our troops, why have they been fighting when they were fighting? 

Kulbashan Yadev was an opportunity but have we allowed this opportunity to slip through our fingers; was it deliberate or was it incompetence? Afghanistan invaded our territory, has been thrown out and census has been completed but I saw no serious protest or concern. So, I now understand why the social media must be muzzled in this democracy because whereas the evil that surrounds us does pain but the truth is even more painful. We are endangering CPEC, we are becoming unstable in our positions, we do not know our destination, we have no national objectives and we hope that the future will be better but we don’t know why. There is no accountability whether it’s a PIA Plane on a narco mission or Ayyan Ali laundering money, there is no one responsible for foreign policy failures or government in collapse. So who and what should he fight for?

My question then remains, and I would like someone to educate me, ‘With are territorial spaces threatened, with our sovereign rights set aside, our international standing ground to dust, what then should this soldier fight for, what exactly should we tell him? Good luck to all, hope we survive this but then ‘duffers’ such as me have always painted gloom and despair and maybe I am missing the point as well as the party where everyone is celebrating as I stand on the margin watching the show go on.

Maybe as a citizen and a citizen I am, and not as ‘duffer’ of the armed forces, I still have the right to ask questions in this hobbled democracy and have right to demand answers from this parliament, even though it appears to me as an irrelevant parliament:

1. How was Pakistan allowed to attend the Saudi Coalition when the Parliament had ruled that we shall not be a part of it?

2. Why is the Parliament silent on making the Dawn Leaks a public document?

3. Why is the Parliament quiet on the Abbottabad Commission?

4. Does the Parliament have any concern for the alleged Border Violations and do they have any constructive recommendations?

5. Has the Parliament called the Committee on Kashmir to ask how they justify their existence? Or is there any direction by the Parliament on this matter.

6. Will the Parliament debate and discuss the unconstitutional debt accumulated and debt servicing?

7. Will the Parliament question the government on their handling of the Kulbashan Case.

8. Will the Parliament insist on making public all CPEC ‘deals’?

Moosa during the last period I am going to send an ummat, who will be the Ummat of Mohammed (SAW) with dry lips, parched tongues, emaciated body with eyes sunken deep into their sockets, with livers dry and stomachs suffering the pangs of hunger- will call out to me (in dua) they will be much closer to me than you O Moosa! while you speak to me there are 70000 veils between you and me but at the time of iftaar there will not be a single veil between me and the fasting Ummati of Mohammed (SAW) O!! Moosa I have taken upon myself the responsibility that at the time of iftaar I will never refuse the dua of a fasting person!

5/27/17, 12:29 PM - M Amir Balouch HS: علاقے کی سب سے بڑی محل نما کوٹھی ۔کے بڑے
 اور سب سے ٹھنڈے کمرے میں سیٹھ صاحب ویڈیو کال کرنے میں مصروف تھے ۔
یہ کال مدینہ مسجد نبوی میں کی جا رہی تھی ۔
جہاں آج سیٹھ صاحب نے اپنے والد والدہ اور دوسرے قریبی مرحومین کے ایصال ثواب کے لیے ۔ ۔
کاروبار میں برکت کے لیے ۔
صحت و سلامتی کے لیے ۔ 
مسجد نبوی میں پانچ سو افراد کی افطاری کروانا تھی ۔ ۔
وہ ویڈیو لنک کے ذریعے انتظامات کا جائزہ لے رہے تھے ۔ 
وہ خوش تھے ۔ ۔اس ثواب کا اندازہ کر کے جو اس افطاری سے انہیں ملنے والا تھا ۔ ۔
علاقے میں واہ واہ بونس میں تھی ۔
ابھی افطاری ہوئی ہی نہیں تھی ۔کہ ہر جگہ ان کی سخاوت کے چرچے تھے ۔
ایک دو بندوں کی افطاری کرانی بھی مشکل ہوتی ہے اور سیٹھ صاحب نے مدینہ سے دور رہ کر مدینہ میں پانچ سو افراد کی افطاری کروائی ہے ۔ ۔
ماشاءاللہ جی ماشاءاللہ ۔ ۔۔ 
۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ 
بڑی سی کوٹھی سے دو فرلانگ کے فاصلے پر ۔مٹی پھتر گارے اور لکڑی سے بنے بے ہنگم مکان کے اونچے نیچے صحن میں بیٹھی اماں جنتے افطاری کا سامان تیار کر رہی تھی ۔ 
کجھور مہنگی تھی ۔ سو اس کی جگہ گڑ تھا ۔ جو سال کے سال ۔ ۔مظفرگڑھ سے آتا تھا اور اماں محفوظ کر لیا کرتی تھی ۔ 
اس کے علاوہ ۔تخم ملنگا ملے پانی میں لیموں کی جگہ نمک ذرا ذیادہ کردیاتھا ۔ ۔
فاصل چاچا پاس ہی چھلنگا چارپائی میں بیٹھا ۔تقریبا دسویں بار پوچھ رہا تھا ۔
پانی ٹھنڈا ہوا کہ نہیں ۔ 
اماں نے ہاتھ پانی کی بالٹی میں ڈالا ۔ اور بولی ۔ 
ہاں ٹھنڈا ہے ۔ ۔سارا دن چھاوں میں پڑا رہا ۔ ۔ٹھنڈی ریت پر ۔ اوپر بوری تھی گھڑے پر ۔ اب بھی ٹھنڈا نہ ہو گا ۔ ۔ ۔ ؟
تجھے لگتا ہے آج روزہ کچھ ذیادہ ہی لگ گیا ہے ۔
ہاں بھلی لوک ۔ آج تو پیاس سے دم نکلے جا رہا ہے آج برف نہیں آئی کہیں سے ۔ 
اماں جنتے کے بجائے ۔لڑکا دانش بولا ۔
ابا گیا تھا میں ۔ آنٹی رخسانہ کے گھر پر وہ کہتی ہیں کہ بجلی ہی نہیں برف کیا بنے ۔ ۔
ابا ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ 
دانش تھوڑا چپ کر کے پھر بولا ۔
ہاں پتر ۔
ابا آج وڈے چوہدری جی نے مکے مدینے میں افطاری کرائی ہے ۔ ۔ پانچ سو بندوں کی ۔ ۔
بوڑھا فاضل حیران سا ہوا ۔ 
مکے مدینے ۔ ۔ ۔ادھر کوئی نہیں تھا ۔ افطاری کرنے والا ۔ 
ابا وہاں ثواب ذیادہ ہوتا ہے نا ۔ وہ وڈا گھر ہے نا رب کا ۔ 
ہمیں بھی کبھی کرا دیتے تو ۔ ۔ثواب ہی ہونا تھا ۔ 
بوڑھے فاضل نے حسرت سے کہا ۔ ۔
برف ہی دے دیتے تو ۔
ہائے ہائے دانش کے ابا کچھ خوف خدا کر ۔
پر ابا ادھر ثواب کم ہوتا ہے نا ۔

 
پتا نہیں پتر ثواب تو دینے والا جانے ۔ ۔ ۔ مولوی صاحب تو کہتے ہیں قریب والے کا حق ذیادہ ہوتا ہے ۔ ۔

5/27/17, 12:47 PM - M Amir Balouch HS: ایک ضروری اعلان سماعت فرمائیں 

حکومت نے 1.6 بلین روپے کے رمضان پیکج کا اعلان کر دیا ہے ۔۔۔ 260 میلین آبادی کے تناسب سے 28 دنوں میں ایک پاکستانی کو مبلغ 7 روپے ملیں گے ۔۔ یعنی 0.3 پیسے ہر دن کے حساب سے ۔۔ اِس وقت ایک سموسے کی قیمت 15 روپے ہے ۔۔ اِس حساب سے حکومت کے دئیے ہوۓ پیکج کی مدد سے ، ایک آدمی پورے رمضان میں آدھا سموسہ خرید سکتا ہے ۔۔ اب آدھا سموسہ تو مارکیٹ سے ملنے سے رہا ! لہٰذا آپ کسی دوست کے ساتھ شراکت داری کر کے پورا سموسہ خرید لیں اور آدھا آدھا انجوائے کریں ۔۔ شکریہ 
نوٹ :- لال چٹنی لینا نہ بھولیں ۔۔

5/29/17, 4:36 AM - ‪+92 307 4209212‬: ایسی چیز جس کے کھانے سے روزہ نہیں ٹوٹتا
علی گڑھ کے معروف شاعر "شمیم بستوی " 
 رمضان کے مہینہ میں بازار سے لوٹ رہے تھے ۔ ہاتھ میں تھیلی تھی ۔ تھیلی میں کوئی سامان تھا۔ راستے میں ایک پہچان والے مل گئے ۔پوچھا:
"مولانا کیا لے کر جارہے ہیں "
انہوں نے کہا:
"ایسی چیز جس کے کھانے سے روزہ نہیں ٹوٹتا۔۔"
ان صاحب نے کہا:
 " ایسی چیزوں کا علم مولانا لوگ اپنے پاس چھپا کر رکھتے ہیں اور ہمیں بتایا جاتا ہے کچھ بھی کھاؤ روزہ ٹوٹ جائے گا۔"
انھوں نے تھیلی کھول کر دکھائی ۔ اس میں " جوتے " رکھے تھے...!

5/30/17, 9:52 AM - ‪+92 300 9506088‬: *💛بچوں کو اپنے قریب کیجیے💛* 

📝عربی کے چند کلمات ایک جگہ پڑھے تو ان کی جامعیت نے حیران کر دیا۔ چار کلمات پر مشتمل یہ نہایت قیمتی نصیحتیں گویا والدین کے بچوں کے ساتھ خوشگوار تعلقات کی کلید ہیں…
❗ذرا ملاحظہ فرمائیں:
*اقتربوا من ابناکم… وشاوروھم… وحاوروھم…واکسبوھم… قبل ان تخسروھم…!*
ترجمہ: 
*اپنے بچوں کے قریب رہا کرو …*
*انُ سے مشورے کیا کرو…*
*تبادلۂ خیال کیا کرو…* 
*انُ کے دل جیت لو…* 
*قبل اس کے کہ تم انہیں ہمیشہ کے لئےکھو دو…*
والدین کی سب سے اول اور بڑی ذمے داری، بچوں کی صحیح تعلیم وتربیت ہوتی ہے۔ بچپن اور لڑکپن کا زمانہ بے شعوری وبے خیالی کا دور ہوتا ہے۔ 
اس وقت بچے بڑوں کے رحم وکرم کے محتاج ہوتے ہیں۔ بچے انہی کو اپنا محسن سمجھتے ہیں جو انہیں اپنے قریب رکھتے ہیں، ان سے پیار کرتے ہیں۔ 
*بہترین تربیت جو قربت وانسیت سے ممکن ہے، ڈانٹ ڈپٹ اور مار دھاڑ سے ہرگز ویسی ممکن ہی نہیں.*

سیرت النبی میں بچوں کے ساتھ آپ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کے حسنِ سلوک کا جائزہ لیں تو آپ بہترین مربّی اور بچوں پر رحم کرنے والے نظر آئیں گے۔ 
*آپ ﷺ نے بچوں کے ساتھ نرمی، محبت، عاطفت،الفت  کا درس نہ صرف اپنی تعلیمات ہی کے ذریعہ دیا، بلکہ اپنے عمل سے بھی اس کا ثبوت پیش فرمایا۔*
آپﷺ نے بچوں کے بچپنے کا ہر لحاظ سے خیال رکھا۔ اپنی تمام تر رفعت شان کے باوجود ان کے ساتھ کھیلے بھی اور کبھی ان پر سختی نہیں فرمائی۔ 
اپنے پیارے نواسوں سے آپﷺ کی محبت و شفقت کے کئی واقعات ہم سنتے پڑھتے رہتے ہیں کہ کیسے *وہ عین نماز کی حالت میں بھی لاڈ سے آپ ﷺ پر سوار ہوجاتے تھے اور آپﷺ ناراض تو کیا ہوتے، ان کے لیے سجدے کو طویل فرما لیتے۔*
ایک بار آپﷺ حضرت حسن کو چوم رہے تھے۔ ایک دیہاتی نے اعتراض کرتے ہوئے گویا حیرت کا اظہار کیا آپﷺ نے فرمایا:
*اگر اللّہ نے تیرے دل سے رحمت کو نکال دیا تو میں کیا کرسکتا ہوں؟!*
ایک بار ایک اور ایسے ہی موقع پر جب ایک صحابی نے حیرت کا اظہار کیا تو فرمایا کہ جو شخص رحم نہیں کرتا، اس پر بھی رحم نہیں کیا جاتا۔
مسلمان تو مسلمان ،حضور نے تو کفار کے بچوں کے ساتھ بھی نرمی کی تلقین فرمائی۔ ایک یہودی کا لڑکا آپ علیہ السلام کی خدمت میں آیا کرتا تھا۔ وہ ایک دفعہ بیمار ہوگیا۔ آپﷺ نے از خود تشریف لے جا کر اس کی عیادت فرمائی۔ اس بچے کے سر ہانے بیٹھے، پھر اس بچے سے فرمایا: اسلام قبول کرو، اس بچے نے اپنے والد پر نظر ڈالی۔ والد نے بھی کہا:ابوالقاسم (ﷺ)کی اطاعت کرو، لہٰذا وہ بچہ مسلمان ہوگیا۔ آپﷺ یہ کہتے ہوئے نکلے:
"تمام تعریفیں اسی اللّہ کے لئے ہیں جس نے اس کو آگ سے بچالیا۔"
*آج اس اسوہ حسنہ کی روشنی میں ہم اپنے سلوک کا جائزہ لیں تو معلوم ہو گا کہ کفار اور غیر کے بچے تو الگ، ہم اپنے بچوں، اپنے خون کے ساتھ کیسا بیگانے کا سا سلوک کرتے ہیں؟*
باپ کی درشت مزاجی کی وجہ سے بچہ پڑوسی انکل کے زیادہ قریب، باپ سے دور ہوتا ہے…
بات بات پہ مارنا، چلانا، برا بھلا کہنا بچوں کو نہ صرف ڈھیٹ بنا دیتا ہے بلکہ ان کو ماں باپ سے دور بھی کر دیتا ہے… 
*پھرہوتا یہ ہے کہ بچے اس جذباتی خلا کو باہر والوں سے پر کرنے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں…* 
باہر پھرتے سفاک درندے ایسے ہی معصوموں کا شکار کرنے گھات لگائے بیٹھے ہوتے ہیں… سو وہ انہیں جھوٹی محبت کے جال میں پھانس کر ان کا جذباتی و جنسی استحصال تک کر بیٹھتے ہیں۔
گھر میں خود بچے سے متعلق امور میں بھی اس سے کوئی مشورہ نہیں ہوتا، نہ اس سے رائے لی جاتی ہے اور نہ اس کی پسند ناپسند کا خیال رکھا جاتا ہے… 
ہر وقت، ہر بات میں بس اپنی مرضی چلائی بلکہ باقاعدہ ٹھونسی جاتی ہے… 
آہستہ آہستہ والدین اور بچوں کے درمیان ایک ایسی اجنبیت کی دیوار کھڑی ہونے لگتی ہے کہ پھر بچہ کسی جذباتی کشمکش کا شکار ہو جائے، اس کے ساتھ کچھ غلط ہونے لگے تو وہ چاہتے ہوئے بھی اپنی بات والدین سے شیئر نہیں کر پاتا… 
اور یوں یہ صورت حال کبھی خدانخواستہ ناقابل تلافی نقصان کا باعث بن جاتی ہے۔
*یاد رکھیے …👏🏻*
انگلی پکڑ کر چلانے والے ہاتھ جب ہاتھ چھوڑ دیں تو پھر جانے کون کون انگلیاں پکڑتا ہے اور کس کس سمت لے جاتا ہے۔ 
اپنے احساسات کو جھنجھوڑئیے اپنی غفلت کو دور کیجیے۔ 
مستقبل کے ان ہونہار نونہالوں کو اپنے سے قریب کیجیے، ان سے مشورے کیجیے، انہیں اہمیت کا احساس دلائیے، گاہے ان کے ساتھ تبادلۂ خیال کیا کیجیے اور ان کے دل جیت لیجیے… 
قبل اس کے کہ آپ انہیں ہمیشہ کے لئے کھو دیں…!
*اللّہ سبحان و تعالی ہم سب کو  سلیم عطا فرمائے اور اچھے والدین بننے کی توفیق عطا فرمائے*
