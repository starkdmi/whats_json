11/08/2021, 15:45 - +91 99893 76385: 1. COVID-19 related Research Topics: Applying ML/DL technique.

		Auto Preventing transmission Methods: Detect mask wore or not? Properly wore or just available?
					 Detect Social Distance following or not?

		2. Federated Learning (Advanced DL): How to process COVID samples with privacy.

	Object Detection Areas:

		3. Post attendance based on image of a class room. It may be any audience scenario.

	4. Employees Attendance tracking based on entry and exit instead of Bio-metric punch-in/out.

					
	I suggest to do some analysis in the above topics.

19/09/2021, 15:25 - +91 93483 43310: A/C temp control
19/09/2021, 15:26 - +91 99893 76385: If only PA, then it's already there. False advertising
19/09/2021, 15:26 - +91 76829 26742: Sir here ai means to assit drivers to keep the car in lane and maintain a safe distance from a car in front and cruise control etc
19/09/2021, 15:26 - Saliq Iet Vit: Also hyper advanced ai based safety assistance
19/09/2021, 15:27 - Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: driver-assist functions like Adaptive Cruise Control, Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, etc...

19/09/2021, 15:28 - +91 99893 76385: Need to explore how AI helps for these tasks
19/09/2021, 15:32 - +91 99893 76385: Can you demonstrate/ explain, how can AI helps in these tasks in the upcoming class. @919565556292

19/09/2021, 15:33 - Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: By using camera and sensors at the front of the car.
19/09/2021, 15:34 - +91 99893 76385: If you fix camera and sensors, sufficient? They work themselves?
19/09/2021, 15:34 - +91 99893 76385: I don't want answer like question one answer in CAT1. I want practical scenario
19/09/2021, 15:35 - Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: They definitely will require proper programming for this..
😅
19/09/2021, 15:35 - Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: Ok sir I'll try
19/09/2021, 15:35 - Divyesh Tripathi Prob And Stats: 👍🏻

19/09/2021, 16:13 - +91 86583 22524: Sure sir !!
19/09/2021, 16:56 - Prathik Vit Bbs Batchmate: In the above mentioned car, The AI part of it is only implemented for the personal assistant feature not for the advanced driver assists system (ADAS). ADAS uses various chips called Systems on a chip(SOC), which connects the sensors embedded in the chassis of the car to actuators through interfaces and directly linked to the Electronic Control Unit(ECU). As it is mentioned in the pdf sent above, the ADAS is at autonomous driving level 2. AI only gets implemented in autonomous driving from level 3 onwards till level 5. 

The Personal Assistant system that does use AI, uses Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding, it would give replies mimicing a normal human. It can also have control of the interior features of the car for example, opening the sunroof, or switching the radio station or making a call.
