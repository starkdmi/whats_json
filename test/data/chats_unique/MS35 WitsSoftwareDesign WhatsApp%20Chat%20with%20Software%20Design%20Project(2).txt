2018/08/06, 22:22 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Have you figured how to put the badges
2018/08/06, 22:28 - motsilp: Nah

2018/08/08, 09:50 - You added Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa
2018/08/09, 15:18 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hey guys,our next meeting with Matthew and Richard is on Monday 12pm. I think that's when we will also get the data as well.

There's one thing we didn't seem to concider on our last meeting with Matthew,our project is Test Date and Classroom Scheduling but we seem to only concentrate on the Classroom Scheduling with Matthew. So my question is are we going both projects or just the Classroom Scheduling?
2018/08/09, 15:28 - motsilp: They can decide which parts they want to add to the Product Backlog
2018/08/09, 15:30 - motsilp: So both can be done in order of importance from the Product backlog. It also gives us a lot so that we don't really have to finish everything everything. Remember Terence said that if everything is done done before we run out of time, then the project was too small
2018/08/09, 15:30 - motsilp: Is Richard coming to the meeting as well?
2018/08/09, 15:38 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea from Monday he will be around
2018/08/09, 15:39 - motsilp: We also need a copy of tge venue booking and/or test scheduling forms
2018/08/09, 15:39 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Why?
2018/08/09, 15:41 - motsilp: They can also help with the type of data we need to collect and how to collect it
For example, the venue booking form can show us how the venue booking web page should look
2018/08/09, 15:42 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: But from the data it will tell you what type of data is needed
2018/08/09, 15:43 - motsilp: Doesn't hurt to have as much info as possible ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇ
2018/08/09, 15:43 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: For instance,the data Matthew showed us. That data is from the forms it's just writtien in a spreadsheet
2018/08/09, 15:44 - motsilp: True
2018/08/09, 15:44 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: But if you want it you can ask for it on Monday but for the test there's no form whatsoever
2018/08/09, 15:46 - motsilp: Oh okay
2018/08/12, 19:56 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Good evening guys,

2018/08/25, 15:51 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay cool

2018/08/25, 21:38 - motsilp: I like the first one more
2018/08/26, 00:47 - motsilp: *ATTENTION!!!!!!!!*


Someone who did the course last year told me that most of what we have to do for Sprint 1 is pretty much documentation, minutes, deciding on architecture, setting up Github, Taiga, Travis and Coveralls and making sure that they work, writing a wiki on what our project does and the vision behind it, maybe have a working login/ logout and some small interaction with the database, minutes and agenda of our meetings, have a refined backlog (kinda there), planning out how everything will be done, etc
2018/08/26, 00:47 - motsilp: its mostly writing out documents
2018/08/26, 00:55 - motsilp: @27742262952  @27798872874  do we have Coveralls working yet?
2018/08/26, 01:04 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I have all the minutes in formal writing and the voice recordings I always take during meetings.

Since Mo offered to do most of the documentation we just need to give him whatever he needs to get started
2018/08/26, 01:12 - motsilp: We also need minutes and agenda for the meetings between us
2018/08/26, 01:15 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I have everything
2018/08/26, 01:17 - motsilp: Cool. All we need to do is just type them up and put them on Github
2018/08/26, 01:21 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay
2018/08/26, 01:22 - motsilp: And we all need to commit something on Github. Even if its a .txt with a short meaase
2018/08/26, 01:24 - motsilp: And we need to test something on Travis and Coveralls. Even if that test is saying 1 = 1 is true
2018/08/26, 01:26 - motsilp: So we need a wiki on Github saying what we are making and why and yada yada yada ya
2018/08/26, 01:27 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Just copy it from Taiga because the person who created the project must have at least done that
2018/08/26, 01:37 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/08/26, 01:38 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Go into Taiga right now,it has WIKI
2018/08/26, 01:48 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: I should've uploaded a README.md file that states that
2018/08/26, 03:30 - motsilp: You deleted this message
2018/08/26, 03:32 - motsilp: https://github.com/ProperNotifier/coms3009-propernotifier

This is an example of what our Github should look like. This was made by Mellow and her team last year
2018/08/26, 03:32 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: You're setting all that up?
2018/08/26, 03:35 - motsilp: Nah. Not yet. Imma catch like 30 minutes of shuteye first
2018/08/26, 03:36 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay
2018/08/26, 04:00 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: I'm also getting some info from another groups github from last year.... Will let you know when they give me the repo
2018/08/26, 04:01 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Cool

2018/08/26, 15:42 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: SD probably
2018/08/26, 23:28 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: @27741722354 do you have Discord?
2018/08/26, 23:31 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: I tried using it on my phone but it says I can't authenticate connection so doesn't want to connect
2018/08/26, 23:33 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: But if it doesn't work then just record the meeting and I'll do what I did with the last recording and just ask you if I miss understand anything
2018/08/26, 23:34 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay no problem
2018/08/27, 11:16 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hey guys please don't forget about the meeting at 12
2018/08/27, 11:17 - motsilp: Isn't it 12:30?
2018/08/27, 11:19 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: No 12,the 1st time was 12:30 because Matthew had a meeting before that. Our last meeting was at 12
2018/08/27, 11:19 - motsilp: Fuck. I'm too far
2018/08/27, 11:20 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: It's okay you'll join us or will explain after if we finish early
2018/08/27, 11:20 - motsilp: Thanks
2018/08/27, 12:04 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I'm already at MSB
2018/08/28, 16:37 - motsilp: Guys please Taiga urgently to view the taskboard. I have already allocated tasks but you can change them if you feel they aren't just (I tried to be fiar)
2018/08/28, 17:44 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hloni what reasoning did you use when pointing tasks to every one?
2018/08/28, 17:47 - motsilp: Who is one front end and who is on backend
2018/08/28, 17:48 - motsilp: So you and Matt got frontend
Masi and I have backend
Mo isn't on Taiga so I couldn't allocate to him
2018/08/28, 17:48 - motsilp: You can change it if you want. We need help on the login backend
2018/08/28, 17:49 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Masi is working on that,well last I was informed rather
2018/08/28, 17:49 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: And i alternate between front and back
2018/08/28, 17:50 - motsilp: The LDAP stuff is a mission. We need all the help we can get
2018/08/28, 17:50 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I thought we were following the allocation from one first allocation meeting but it's cool
2018/08/28, 17:50 - motsilp: I am aware of that
2018/08/28, 17:51 - motsilp: Wasn't the initial allocation
Matt and Mo on front
Masi and I on back
You on both?
2018/08/28, 17:52 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Then the task?
2018/08/28, 17:53 - motsilp: I divided the tasks between front and back
2018/08/28, 17:53 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Its cool with go on with your allocation
2018/08/28, 17:53 - motsilp: Or at least I think I did
2018/08/29, 07:56 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hey guys,don't forget about today's meeting
2018/08/29, 08:08 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Today's meeting?
2018/08/29, 08:09 - motsilp: At 11
2018/08/29, 08:15 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: I've got HPC , won't make it
2018/08/29, 08:16 - motsilp: What is HPC?
2018/08/29, 08:33 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: And it's our last meeting before submission and after the meeting we went to yesterday with Hloni we need to discuss a few things since our approach to the project has hit a slight bump
2018/08/29, 08:36 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: When did we decide on having a meeting today? I'd already planned my day
2018/08/29, 08:37 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: When are our daily face to face scrum meetings?
2018/08/29, 08:39 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Every Wednesday for the past 3 weeks I've been at HPC from 10-12, if our meetings are at the time, then I'm sorry
2018/08/29, 08:41 - motsilp: <Media omitted>

2018/08/29, 08:44 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/08/29, 08:46 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: You're joking right?
2018/08/29, 08:49 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Don't worry, I'll cut my session shortüòå
But Ima be late
2018/08/29, 08:51 - motsilp: @27742262952 Which day do you think it is?
2018/08/29, 11:00 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Meeting is at WSS tut room 113
2018/08/29, 11:09 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We're moving to 106
2018/08/29, 11:12 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: Gonna leave my lecture in 10
2018/08/29, 11:14 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay
2018/08/29, 11:29 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: On my way
2018/08/29, 11:43 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: 106 has a class though
2018/08/29, 11:44 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Sorry 107
2018/08/29, 18:50 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Guys,I've got travis ci and coveralls working on the dev branch on github
2018/08/29, 18:51 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/08/29, 18:55 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Guys I just came out of the meeting with Mo and a were going the Sprint 1 rubric and were focusing on wrong this. One we don't even know what architecture were using but were already developing. For Sprint 1 we need documentation mainly and we currently don't have it even if we did it won't be properly. So I need us to discuss some things right now to help Mo and I complete the documantation
2018/08/29, 18:55 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay cool
2018/08/29, 18:58 - motsilp: I'm on the bus right now
2018/08/29, 18:58 - motsilp: I'll respond properly when I get home
2018/08/29, 18:59 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: It's okay im also trying to get to my room
2018/08/29, 18:59 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Must we just start at 20:00?
2018/08/29, 19:00 - motsilp: I know we don't really have an event-driven architecture
2018/08/29, 19:00 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We will discuss everything at 8
2018/08/29, 19:01 - motsilp: But we are probably moving to a OOD
2018/08/29, 19:01 - motsilp: I'll probably still be on the road
2018/08/29, 19:01 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: What time will you be home?
2018/08/29, 19:01 - motsilp: 8:30
2018/08/29, 19:02 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay 9 then to give you time
2018/08/29, 19:14 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah that's fine. Thandi what time did you book the assessment with Terrence on Friday?
2018/08/29, 19:17 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: 12:30
2018/08/29, 19:18 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Oh ok cool,thanks.
2018/08/29, 19:19 - motsilp: Thanks
2018/08/29, 20:04 - motsilp: Does anyone have the actual architecture slides Terence has been using in class?
2018/08/29, 20:27 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Should be on one of the slides
2018/08/29, 21:01 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: We starting?
2018/08/29, 21:02 - motsilp: Yeah
2018/08/29, 21:03 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea. Can we please all have Sprint 1 rubric open for all of us because I want us to actually check on what we have and don't have
2018/08/29, 21:06 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Ok,what next?
2018/08/29, 21:07 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Sorry,didn't see the last part of the message
2018/08/29, 21:09 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We are going to do a checklist, for the first thing on the rubric its basically the documentation of the meetings we have been having with Richard and Matthew and also as group and also adding the meeting Hloni and I had with Mrs Moosa from PIMD on Tuesday  so that fine.
2018/08/29, 21:11 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: What I wanna know is for the second part "Requirements Analysis document" is the WIKI on Taiga has a description of the project?
2018/08/29, 21:12 - motsilp: Taiga has a wiki?
2018/08/29, 21:13 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I'll check
2018/08/29, 21:15 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: It won't show on our end since we didn't create the project
2018/08/29, 21:16 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah it does,Matt still had his account logged on so I can see it.
2018/08/29, 21:16 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: <Media omitted>
2018/08/29, 21:17 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Masi change the number of expected Sprints to 5
2018/08/29, 21:18 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay,done
2018/08/29, 21:18 - motsilp: Enable wiki
2018/08/29, 21:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Done
2018/08/29, 21:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I think you should be able to see it on your taiga right now
2018/08/29, 21:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: On the sidebars
2018/08/29, 21:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: It's the icon that is an openbook
2018/08/29, 21:20 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: yea its visible, I think we should turn everything in those settings on
2018/08/29, 21:21 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay will do.
2018/08/29, 21:22 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: <Media omitted>
2018/08/29, 21:23 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea leave it off
2018/08/29, 21:24 - motsilp: Don't enable Kanban
2018/08/29, 21:25 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I thought Mat was going to complete the WIKI since he is the one who created the project but then thats that. Now which architecture are we using?
2018/08/29, 21:29 - motsilp: It looks like we have a microkernel architecture
2018/08/29, 21:29 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Is that ideal for a web application?
2018/08/29, 21:30 - motsilp: I think so. Everything thing we add can be seen as a plugin.
2018/08/29, 21:31 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I don't understand how is that so
2018/08/29, 21:36 - motsilp: Think of basic adding and viewing as a basic product. Then look at the remaining features we have to implement as a plugin. So look at these as features that add extra functionality:
Email reminders
Cutoff dates
Filtering down the bookings by days and time
Optimisation
Allowing deletion and updating of bookings
Clash resolving
Etc
2018/08/29, 21:37 - motsilp: The basic product can be the website with a login, lectures application and viewing pages, and PIMD being able to view the venue applications
2018/08/29, 21:38 - motsilp: Small things like auto-logout can be added as plugins as well
2018/08/29, 21:40 - motsilp: With a mix of a layered architecture
2018/08/29, 21:40 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I think you're right actually, but the thing is how much of what was mentioned in the first paragraph is actually part of the main functionality?
2018/08/29, 21:41 - motsilp: Mentioned here?
2018/08/29, 21:41 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah
2018/08/29, 21:42 - motsilp: Maybe one
2018/08/29, 21:43 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I'm confused
2018/08/29, 21:45 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: The thing is I feel plugins are like apps to a phone,a phones basic function is to call but we found that other needs may be met by a phone if that makes sense
2018/08/29, 21:46 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: So we have apps that allow you to text,or play games and so forth which are not critical to the system but are nice to have
2018/08/29, 21:50 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Thats what I was going to raise actually,and also isn't that a website is informational it doesn't really take in database and a web application is more interactive whereby there is a communication between the web and database since if certain buttons are pressed data can be fetched and displayed(fetch form for update) and push/send data to the database(venue application information from the application form) (which is what I thought we were doing)
2018/08/29, 21:54 - motsilp: Let's just call it "the system" for now
2018/08/29, 21:54 - motsilp: I like Masi's analogy
2018/08/29, 22:01 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We can't call it the "the system" in the documentation we need to say which architecture we are using and why also that will give us a clear idea of which programming languages to use
2018/08/29, 22:02 - motsilp: This is what I'm proposing:
The basic product is the system with a login. From the login the user can either apply for a venue or view any applications that they have made; or they can view all the applications that have been made if they are PIMD user.

This is a product that sort of mimics the way PIMD works currently and makes their lives easier by having one centralised datasource
2018/08/29, 22:03 - motsilp: Everything else can be added as a plugin that adds in a new feature
2018/08/29, 22:05 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I'm not all for the plugin thingy its just not fitting what I think we are suppose to be doing
2018/08/29, 22:06 - motsilp: In the end we deliver the same working product. It also makes developing easier
2018/08/29, 22:07 - motsilp: It's not like they are going to download them
2018/08/29, 22:11 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Its not about them downloaded them its about understanding the architecture that we are using and how it best fits our project. If we just choosing an architecture for peace sake that was going to be okay but now we have to account for why we use plugins and I personally can't and I feel like we should use something more relative to web application like Model-View-Control architecture, we won't we even have to change the languages we are working in because it does accommodate them
2018/08/29, 22:16 - motsilp: MVC is not an architecture, it's more of a methodology of developing software. Each new feature we add would follow MVC. Four types of architectures were covered in class. These are:
Layered
Microkernel
Event-driven and
Space based
2018/08/29, 22:22 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: <Media omitted>
2018/08/29, 22:23 - motsilp: We don't really have a use for an Event-driven or Space-based architecture. Their main method of operation is not really suited for our project. We could try a layered architecture but that makes adding new stuff a mission and also makes fixing errors and changing stuff a nightmare because everything builds up on something below it in the layers. It also makes deployment a problem because you'll have to redeploy the whole product for any small changes you make or any new features you add
2018/08/29, 22:24 - motsilp: Oh, okay
2018/08/29, 22:27 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: And I don't see the architecture you mentioned on the notes,did he mention them by passing in the lecture?
2018/08/29, 22:28 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Besides Layeres and Microkernel ofcourse
2018/08/29, 22:28 - motsilp: He did microkernel today in class
2018/08/29, 22:28 - motsilp: He did event driven and space based in class today
2018/08/29, 22:29 - motsilp: Even used AWS as an example for space based
2018/08/29, 22:29 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: From the textbook notes?
2018/08/29, 22:30 - motsilp: Yeah
2018/08/29, 22:30 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/08/29, 22:30 - motsilp: This is recommended
2018/08/29, 22:33 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Thanks man
2018/08/29, 22:34 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea I have it
2018/08/29, 22:38 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I think we should do some research I mean what defines an architecture as opposed to an architectural pattern? I mean is the architecture just mainly the framework but then the interaction between parts in the architecture defines the architecture, but then wouldn't that be a pattern. Unless it's just me?
2018/08/29, 22:45 - motsilp: We sound sleepy ü§£ü§£ü§£
2018/08/29, 22:47 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Nah I'm actually on the same page as you
2018/08/29, 22:50 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: üòÇyeah I think we should sleep on it. 

But yeah,I think once we understand the difference between pattern architecture  we can move on quicker. I mean there's a video I watched just now that sorta helps but not really.
2018/08/29, 22:51 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: https://youtu.be/i7aKW7YNOxY
2018/08/29, 22:54 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We really don't have the time to sleep over things because tomorrow is the last day,but by tomorrow say before 12 we should have decided. 

So going "Software Architecture and Design"
2018/08/29, 23:05 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah,but we can make it earlier because if it's both architecture and design its gonna be quite a lot
2018/08/29, 23:07 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Is the WIKI filled in Github?
2018/08/29, 23:10 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I don't think so
2018/08/29, 23:19 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: That should be done as well
2018/08/30, 10:54 - motsilp: hen are we meeting
2018/08/30, 11:01 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: When thandi is done with class. Also I'm not in today so I'll discord in.
2018/08/30, 11:01 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: The are not physically meeting we will talk here or on discord
2018/08/30, 11:03 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: We should use discord,try get it on your PC's,it will make life easier.
2018/08/30, 11:15 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: https://discord.gg/KpNekz
2018/08/30, 11:15 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: This is the link to the group once you've installed dicord and made an account.

2018/08/30, 18:25 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Hey guys,do you need any help with the documentation?
2018/08/30, 18:25 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/08/30, 18:29 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: I uploaded a doc on the drive just with a rough template of what I was thinking just needs to kinda hopefully be done then we can see how to merge onto the wiki. Also I think the taiga notes and checklist needs to be completed and ticked off or not for the  sprint. I'm sure there are other things just at work so will have to see when I get home. Uhmmmm yeah .... üòÖüôà
2018/08/30, 18:29 - motsilp: I'll look into it
2018/08/30, 18:30 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: If you can just add what you can it makes life easier and that cause only  tomorrow after we see Terrance will we know what he like what's with his life
2018/08/30, 18:31 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: Yeah hopefully that works out and that
2018/08/30, 18:32 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay cool.
2018/08/30, 20:29 - motsilp: @27741722354 don't make the ERD. DataGrip can generate onr
2018/08/30, 20:29 - motsilp: One
2018/08/30, 22:24 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Is the WIKI for Taiga and GitHub completed?
2018/08/30, 22:25 - motsilp: Don't think they are
2018/08/30, 22:27 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Masi you can handle that  since he was asking if we new help
2018/08/30, 22:29 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Ok cool
2018/08/30, 22:35 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Ok quick question,do we have a shortened product name?
2018/08/30, 22:36 - motsilp: Venues?
2018/08/30, 22:36 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Or should I go by the acronym  CVA which was on one of the files on the drive
2018/08/30, 22:37 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea CVA sounds okay
2018/08/30, 22:37 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay cool
2018/08/30, 23:41 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Guys could you check out the wiki and tell what you think
2018/08/30, 23:44 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: It's the one on github
2018/08/30, 23:46 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: You just copied the template on the drive that Mo uploaded?
2018/08/30, 23:50 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Nah,I actually just wrote it from what I thought was important. But I'll check out Mo's template thanks.
2018/08/30, 23:54 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: So I put my template on the git and added it. See what you peeps think
2018/08/30, 23:54 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: I looked at it. Looks good and on point
2018/08/30, 23:56 - motsilp: Everyone should put in their student numbers
2018/08/31, 00:10 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I can't see it unless I'm looking at the wrong place
2018/08/31, 00:13 - motsilp: @27798872874 i @27742262952 
Student number please
2018/08/31, 00:15 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: 1432706
2018/08/31, 00:15 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I have them I can put them
2018/08/31, 00:15 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: 1272188
2018/08/31, 00:15 - motsilp: Okay cool
2018/08/31, 00:16 - motsilp: Database and ERDs are nearly done
2018/08/31, 00:18 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Also guys,we need to use that "issues" thing on github.
2018/08/31, 00:18 - motsilp: Anyone know where Matt disappeared off to?
2018/08/31, 00:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: It counts towards github usage. I mean I know we have had no code but I think we can add expected issues
2018/08/31, 00:19 - motsilp: Masi you wrote your name wrong
2018/08/31, 00:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Where?
2018/08/31, 00:20 - motsilp: Unless its Masigita
2018/08/31, 00:20 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Oh fix it please
2018/08/31, 00:20 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I fixed it
2018/08/31, 00:21 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Thanks
2018/08/31, 00:28 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Also the epic section in Taiga for the backlog items with large point numbers
2018/08/31, 00:41 - motsilp: Database design is done
2018/08/31, 00:45 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/08/31, 00:50 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: It looks proper
2018/08/31, 00:51 - motsilp: It is in the Database folder in the dev branch on Github
2018/08/31, 00:52 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Cool
2018/08/31, 01:08 - motsilp: The database creation script in on GitHub in the Database folder in the dev branch
2018/08/31, 02:04 - motsilp: What is required from the epics

2018/08/31, 10:43 - motsilp: Someone please update the Taiga Wiki as well. It is based on the Wiki on Github

2018/08/31, 10:45 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Ok cool,cool,I won't forget
2018/08/31, 10:47 - motsilp: Guys I should be there around 11:30
2018/08/31, 10:47 - motsilp: Anyone wanna meet to discuss stuff?
2018/08/31, 10:51 - motsilp: And also to prepare for the Sprint retrospective
2018/08/31, 10:52 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: I'm heading out in a bit, but I'll meet y'all in the laptop station beforehand
2018/08/31, 10:52 - motsilp: Iighy
2018/08/31, 10:56 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: How can we have Sprint retrospective before sprint review?ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
2018/08/31, 10:58 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I haven't had the chance to look at it so I can't really say at this point
2018/08/31, 11:00 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: Well for sprint retrospect: 

we look back on what we did this spring. 

What we could have done better.

What we going to do next from here.
2018/08/31, 11:02 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: So ain't we suppose to wait for the review
2018/08/31, 11:03 - motsilp: We can practice. That's the whole point of it
2018/08/31, 11:03 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Practice what
2018/08/31, 11:04 - motsilp: Responses to possible things Terence might ask
2018/08/31, 11:05 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: That's not retrospective thou
2018/08/31, 11:08 - motsilp: Do you want retrospection or marks? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇ
2018/08/31, 11:11 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I don't see the point of doing something that's not resprospetive and claiming it see for marks.  Rather say a meet up and prepare for question and not say what you're saying
2018/08/31, 11:42 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: This message was deleted

2018/08/31, 18:28 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I'm not sure,but it should be running by tomorrow.

2018/09/02, 12:53 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea we are
2018/09/02, 12:54 - motsilp: What time?
2018/09/02, 12:55 - motsilp: And until when?
2018/09/02, 12:56 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: That's we will discuss as a whole
2018/09/02, 12:57 - motsilp: Cool
2018/09/02, 21:14 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hey guys what time is everyone comfortable with meeting tomorrow morning?
2018/09/02, 21:21 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: 10 is good for me
2018/09/02, 21:28 - motsilp: 10 onwards
2018/09/02, 21:34 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: 10 it is then. Should I look for a tut room or do yall still prefer the laptop station?
2018/09/02, 21:36 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I think laptop station is fine because its holidays
2018/09/03, 09:03 - motsilp: Guys I'm gonna be a bit late
2018/09/03, 09:11 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I'm also going to be a bit late
2018/09/03, 09:26 - Muhammed "Other Mo" Variawa: Guys I'm going to the hospital quick my friends father has been rushed to the ICU so I just need to help him... I will come straight after
2018/09/04, 08:47 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Guys laptop area is closed
2018/09/04, 08:54 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: So I suggest we meet at tut room 112 at wss behind the chem labs
2018/09/04, 08:56 - motsilp: The door is locked? Or like something's going on in there?
2018/09/04, 08:57 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: The door is locked
2018/09/04, 08:58 - motsilp: Bloody idiots ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇ
2018/09/04, 09:01 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay im coming there I was at MSL just now
2018/09/04, 09:02 - motsilp: Is Busi around?
2018/09/04, 09:04 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I don't know
2018/09/04, 09:37 - motsilp: Guys we don't need a LATE table in the database. That can be handled with an extra column in the BOOKINGS table
2018/09/04, 09:39 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Extra column containing what because the late entries will be having full information details
2018/09/04, 09:40 - motsilp: The LATE table will contain late booking right?
2018/09/04, 09:40 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Ya
2018/09/04, 09:44 - motsilp: Then ALL of the data in BOOKINGS and LATE will contain the same characteristics. Creating an extra table doesn't make sense when you can just add a late column in BOOKINGS to mark that a booking is late
2018/09/04, 09:45 - motsilp: This column could be boolean

2018/09/11, 10:53 - motsilp: Yep
2018/09/11, 11:00 - motsilp: I'm updating the server
2018/09/11, 11:00 - motsilp: and installing stuff
2018/09/11, 11:46 - motsilp: The Apache web server has been configured
2018/09/11, 11:46 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Niceüëå
2018/09/11, 11:46 - motsilp: You can access it from your browser by going to venues.ms.wits.ac.za or 146.141.21.128
2018/09/11, 11:53 - motsilp: MySQL is up and running
2018/09/11, 16:47 - motsilp: The server is running properly. Go to venue.ms.wits.ac.za in your browser to test it
2018/09/11, 16:48 - motsilp: And don't hate. It took a lot of work to sync the folders
2018/09/11, 16:48 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay cool,we ain't going to judge lol.
2018/09/11, 16:56 - motsilp: OOPS. Wait a bit though
2018/09/11, 18:22 - motsilp: Here are the MySQL credentials:

2018/09/15, 09:11 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Hey guys can you please post any issues you are having on github issues
2018/09/15, 09:15 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Cool
2018/09/15, 09:17 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Also guys we have a lot of things that need to be discussed. We need to talk about the structure of the "U" in CRUD html hey.
2018/09/15, 09:19 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Because theres a few boundaries that come with a php backend and so I think frontend needs to know what we can and can not do.
2018/09/15, 09:21 - motsilp: I'll look into it when I get on campus today. I might have an idea. I'll also do R and look into C. C is complex
2018/09/15, 09:22 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Ain't the R and U tasks assigned to someone?
2018/09/15, 09:24 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah that's the thing,I think R  can be coupled with U if you think about it.
2018/09/15, 09:25 - motsilp: R is mostly backend and is assigned to me if I'm not mistaken. That backend part is also a huge part of the front end so I kinda have to do both at the same time
2018/09/15, 09:25 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: R and U are being done by the same person. Can we please stick to the assignment of tasks because we are all going to work on the same thing and not get done
2018/09/15, 09:26 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: R for which user role?
2018/09/15, 09:28 - motsilp: Both
2018/09/15, 09:29 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Backend only or everything?
2018/09/15, 09:32 - motsilp: The PHP is actually going to print the table on the html so its kinda doing frontend as well. The HTML will actually be like 5-10 lines of code max  I might as well do it to because of the way they are linked
2018/09/15, 09:33 - motsilp: The HTML can't really be done separately for that
2018/09/15, 09:34 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: View and read will basically the same thing?
2018/09/15, 09:35 - motsilp: They are the same thing
2018/09/15, 09:35 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: View is .... ok nvm, Hloni said itü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ
2018/09/15, 09:37 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: K
2018/09/15, 09:40 - motsilp: I think U should/could be coupled with D
2018/09/15, 13:58 - motsilp: @27746870601 please book a slot for Friday
2018/09/15, 14:00 - motsilp: I'm good for anytime before 1

2018/09/17, 17:08 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: @Richard is happy with the layout of the pages so but still recommends I use bootstrap
2018/09/17, 17:11 - motsilp: So the venue creation page is good as it stands?
2018/09/17, 17:12 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: I just need to take off the signature stuff and put something like a checkbox to confirm that the info in the form is correct
2018/09/17, 17:13 - motsilp: Cool.
2018/09/19, 07:01 - motsilp: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-post-requests-using-python/

@27798872874 dO you think we can make it work?
2018/09/19, 07:37 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I'll let you know once I've read through it properly.
2018/09/19, 08:07 - motsilp: Iight

2018/09/21, 10:31 - motsilp: At what time?
2018/09/21, 10:33 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Friday scrum meetings are at 10
2018/09/21, 10:35 - motsilp: Oh. Hade keh
2018/09/21, 11:10 - motsilp: What's with the Provisional *Faculty* and *School* Allocations?
2018/09/21, 11:12 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Splitting up the work,it's going to be a lot of work optimizing the whole thing so Matthew suggested I split it up since if I can get the school provisonal venue allocation it's just a few change and additional line for code
2018/09/21, 11:13 - motsilp: Doesn't that cause a new problem though?
2018/09/21, 11:14 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Of
2018/09/21, 11:14 - motsilp: Different school allocations having the same venue at the same time?
2018/09/21, 11:15 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: If a venue is booked its moved from the available list
2018/09/21, 11:15 - motsilp: Oh
2018/09/21, 11:16 - motsilp: Do you have any ideas on how to tackle that?
2018/09/21, 11:18 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea

2018/09/21, 11:30 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: And whoever is working on venue application backend I need some clarity so please text me privately
2018/09/25, 17:10 - motsilp: Guys you should all have your own accounts on the venues server. You can do all your server related dev work on there, safe from everyone else's work

Notes:
I'm still setting up apache on them
You do not have sudo access in these accounts
I also have to modify MySQL access on all of them
2018/09/25, 17:10 - motsilp: PHP works though

2018/10/06, 12:44 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Done
2018/10/10, 10:09 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Meeting is at WSS113
2018/10/10, 22:19 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: The answer is probably no but what the heckü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ, is it possible for us to mess around with Github commit time?
2018/10/10, 22:21 - motsilp: Yes
2018/10/10, 22:22 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Really? How?
2018/10/10, 22:24 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hloni add the LDAP issue  to Github as well because it's still on Tiaga
2018/10/10, 23:32 - motsilp: Not too sure but I looked it up a few weeks ago
2018/10/10, 23:33 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Mind looking it up again?üò∂
2018/10/10, 23:46 - motsilp: https://codewithhugo.com/change-the-date-of-a-git-commit/
2018/10/10, 23:47 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Moratuwaüòõ thanks
2018/10/10, 23:50 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/10/10, 23:58 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2018/10/11, 01:16 - motsilp: It has been done
2018/10/11, 01:21 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Thanks
2018/10/11, 01:21 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Are you alone?
2018/10/11, 01:23 - motsilp: Nah, there are some kids here I don't know
2018/10/11, 01:23 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Lol kids that's rude
2018/10/11, 01:24 - motsilp: Its first years, they haven't earned respect yet
2018/10/11, 01:24 - motsilp: They don't even have Block this year
2018/10/11, 01:24 - motsilp: Weaklings
2018/10/11, 01:25 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ ow wow
2018/10/11, 02:06 - motsilp: I want to swap two thing in the backlog
I want to remove Academic/Administrator Venue Booking Update from Sprint 3 and place it into the Backlog.
In its place, I want to move View Venue Allocations to Sprint 3. 

To me it makes more sense this way. Then Venue Booking Update and Delete can be done at the same time in sprint 4
2018/10/11, 02:07 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: That's cool with me
2018/10/11, 02:07 - motsilp: After all, Terence wants to see the venue allocation at work
2018/10/11, 02:30 - motsilp: @27746870601  please check the changes I have made on Taiga and confirm
2018/10/11, 06:37 - motsilp: Status update: I almost have the create cutoff date stuff working. The html just needs some bootstrap
2018/10/11, 08:16 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Mat is working on that HTML so he should give it to you or you give it to him and input that cut off date part
2018/10/11, 08:18 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea everything is fine
2018/10/11, 08:31 - motsilp: He wasn't on it when I started working on the backend for that so I had to make it so that I could move forward. For that whole part I just need help with moving information around in the session and posts. It's that close to completion. He can work on the CSS if he wants to.
2018/10/11, 08:33 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Remember the cut off date is on the home page of PIMD
2018/10/11, 08:33 - motsilp: I also found a simple way of displaying PHP output for all the viewing stuff so all that needs to happen is again the whole posts and sessions thing there as it's the only thing that's really blocking me
2018/10/11, 08:34 - motsilp: You can just point to it. Not much code from there
2018/10/11, 08:35 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Ok
2018/10/11, 08:35 - motsilp: I just need someone to figure out the sessions and posting thing before I get back so that we can spend more time on adding and allocating
2018/10/11, 08:36 - motsilp: We actually have a good shot at delivering everything we need for tomorrow
2018/10/11, 08:36 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I'm can't got class all day
2018/10/11, 08:37 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: And I'm also working on the Lecture Home page
2018/10/11, 08:37 - motsilp: The NavBar thing?
2018/10/11, 08:38 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: The whole modal thing is easy just that for the application form it's going to be a pain I can't get it to go to the next modal
2018/10/11, 08:38 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Yea
2018/10/11, 08:39 - motsilp: Just add a next button and link it to the next html
2018/10/11, 08:40 - motsilp: Or look up iframes on w3schools. They can allow us to easily cheat our way around it
2018/10/11, 08:42 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay I'll do that
2018/10/11, 08:43 - motsilp: @27798872874 can you work on populating the users and the courses tables on the DB
2018/10/11, 08:55 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay sure
2018/10/11, 08:57 - motsilp: And please look up posts and sessions üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ they are blocking me hard
2018/10/11, 08:58 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay, I'm on my way to campus so I'll be to see what's up.
2018/10/11, 08:59 - motsilp: Cool
2018/10/11, 08:59 - motsilp: Lemme sleep for about two hours
2018/10/11, 08:59 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: 3,sleep 3 hours
2018/10/11, 09:00 - motsilp: ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇ
2018/10/11, 19:56 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Hey guys. Can we all give a quick update of how far is every one with their tasks.

For me I'm done with the Lecture/course admin "homepage",the application form is nearly done just the modal switching left and connecting logout to login page
2018/10/11, 20:13 - motsilp: I'm still trying to sort out the sessions thingy
2018/10/11, 20:18 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Diagrams?

2018/10/11, 20:22 - motsilp: If I can't figure it out Imma die
2018/10/11, 20:22 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: That's me with this modal thing,yona it's convenient but it's a lot
2018/10/11, 20:25 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah I'm having issues increasing the coverage with the tests.
2018/10/11, 20:25 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Are the tests still failing?
2018/10/11, 20:26 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah they are but I'm more worried about the level of coverage,I think I'll get past it but it's being pretty difficult.
2018/10/11, 20:27 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Can you wing it or you need some extra help?
2018/10/11, 20:28 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I'll try wing it,I'll maybe botch a few things if I cant make it work.
2018/10/11, 20:28 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: You'll what?
2018/10/11, 20:31 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Like just make seem like it's working proper.

2018/10/11, 20:50 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: uhm ok its cool
2018/10/11, 21:23 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: <Media omitted>
2018/10/11, 21:45 - motsilp: If a course does not a class or more classes need to be added, that form should allow to register a new class
2018/10/11, 21:47 - motsilp: <Media omitted>

First things first well done to everyone,y'all did well although we had a pretty rough patch it still went ok
2018/10/12, 19:22 - motsilp: <Media omitted>
2018/10/12, 19:23 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Tis what I'm asking
2018/10/12, 19:23 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We're going to discuss is the keep's and discard's first and then the plan for the next sprint
2018/10/12, 19:24 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Okay
2018/10/12, 19:24 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Keeps and discards in what sense though?
2018/10/12, 19:25 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: As in what were we doing that we should keep doing and what should we discard because it's not working
2018/10/12, 19:27 - motsilp: Behaviour or sprint items?
2018/10/12, 19:27 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Both actually
2018/10/12, 19:29 - motsilp: We plan code thoroughly before we start coding
2018/10/12, 19:30 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Can each of us actually state everything in one message
2018/10/12, 19:32 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: This message was deleted
2018/10/12, 19:32 - motsilp: I'm talking class diagrams, object diagrams, psuedocode the works
2018/10/12, 19:34 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: This message was deleted
2018/10/12, 19:34 - motsilp: Sorry, bus is doing the things to me
2018/10/12, 19:35 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Behavior
Keeps:
- Same environmental coding(crossing)
- Clear communication
2018/10/12, 19:35 - motsilp: Discards: Remove the frontend backend divide
2018/10/12, 19:36 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Seconded
2018/10/12, 19:36 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Thirded
2018/10/12, 19:37 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Sprint
Discard:
- Task division
- Everyone working on the same thing
2018/10/12, 19:39 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: ahh you guys don't listen,when I said each of yall should write everything down I was trying to avoid abo"I second that" because only one thing will be covered in that sense. Even if we are have the same things there might be a few that only one of us pick up
2018/10/12, 19:41 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Have we decided on a db structure?
2018/10/12, 19:44 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Not really,Hloni and I just fixed it last week to suit what we think is best. But Masi picked up an issue which we will discuss at the moment lets deal with what I ask
2018/10/12, 19:44 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: asked*
2018/10/12, 19:44 - motsilp: Everyone writes tests, everyone does documentation
We don't write tests for our own code, someone else does
Code documentation (comments, readme)
We start using deadlines
We have a predetermined task allocation approved by majority vote
2018/10/12, 19:47 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Uhm this is part of what we should start doing not keep and discard unless I'm not following
2018/10/12, 19:49 - motsilp: Yeah, it kinda addresses the what we should stop doing
2018/10/12, 19:52 - motsilp: Keep: Discussing problems we come across
2018/10/12, 19:55 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay I guess we can also get into things we should start doing. Adding to that I just wanna point meeting are everything with the same time slots we all agreed on. On the past few weeks I've been having the daily scrum meetings with like only one of you guys even though the other person would think we were just talking but I recorded that as our scrum meetings because y'all stopped coming to meetings.
So something we should start having again is *scheduled "weekly" scrum meetings*
2018/10/12, 20:05 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: So putting the *things to start doing* Masi said he can give us some guide of some sort regarding creating unit tests. @27798872874  when did you say you'll do it again?
2018/10/12, 20:06 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: I think we somewhat informally agreed upon Wednesday
2018/10/12, 20:06 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: We can do it during the meeting if there isn't much to discuss then
2018/10/12, 20:07 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Yeah okay no problem.
2018/10/12, 20:07 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Everyone okay with that?
2018/10/12, 20:07 - motsilp: Yeah
2018/10/12, 20:10 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Okay,anything to add?
2018/10/12, 20:11 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: I even gave up my training sessions on Wednesdays for the meetings
2018/10/12, 20:14 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: I don't understand how you had training  in the first place because you were there and said yest when we chose Wednesday and even came for like 2 weeks after that
2018/10/12, 20:17 - Motheo "Matt" Sekgetho: Coz training was either cancelled or finished early
2018/10/12, 20:19 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: Ok. Next business matter,planning before we code
2018/10/12, 20:30 - Thandi "Royalty" Tshabalala: First I think we should fix the database. Masi please address the problem you picked up
2018/10/12, 20:34 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: The issue was with how we had to insert values into 2 table before we could put in bookings and venues_requests
2018/10/12, 20:36 - motsilp: That does pose a problem
2018/10/13, 07:07 - Masingita "Masi" Rikhotso: Sorry I feel asleep,it doesn't really pose a problem,it was just inconvenient in the past time frame.
2018/10/13, 11:21 - motsilp: So are we in agreement with the database?
2018/10/13, 11:21 - motsilp: Imma try "object"ify all the code and processes we need today
