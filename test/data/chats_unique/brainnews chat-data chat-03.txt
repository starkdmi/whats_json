12/16/17, 12:00 PM - Neville Longbottom: I was talking with hermione about how we both thought the movie was gonna end on a cliffhanger with Luke about to facedown the whole army
12/16/17, 12:01 PM - Neville Longbottom: Like how could you step it up from that point. Lightspeed bomb into the skimmer salt flat fight with the "they really hate that ship" line
12/16/17, 12:09 PM - Luna Lovegood: Yea I thought it was gonna end with Luke standing there on the flats
12/16/17, 12:09 PM - Luna Lovegood: Glad it didnt
12/16/17, 12:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: So glad it didn‚Äôt. It could be like the last one and I‚Äôd be fine

12/17/17, 12:55 PM - Hermione Granger: This is pretty spot on
12/17/17, 12:56 PM - Luna Lovegood: Agreed
12/17/17, 12:56 PM - Hermione Granger: Let's see if RJ fulfills the potential of all this in the new trilogy
12/17/17, 12:56 PM - Luna Lovegood: I just wanna see more shit like the milking scene üòÇüòÇ
12/17/17, 12:56 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahaha
12/17/17, 12:57 PM - Hermione Granger: Gotta go back the 2nd time with some üçÑüçÑüçÑ
12/17/17, 12:57 PM - Luna Lovegood: I'd be a mess
12/17/17, 12:58 PM - Luna Lovegood: I was so emotional already. Sitting in a sea of bros
12/17/17, 1:00 PM - Hermione Granger: HHahahaha
12/17/17, 1:00 PM - Hermione Granger: Bro nerds or straight bros
12/17/17, 1:01 PM - Luna Lovegood: Production company bros. Since it was a private screening put on by rooster teeth. The most broey company in austin
12/17/17, 1:01 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahahahah
12/17/17, 1:02 PM - Hermione Granger: Our audience was mostly nerdy I think
12/17/17, 1:02 PM - Hermione Granger: The dude in front of us interrupted us and chastised Will for not noticing severus Cain's cameo in Dunkirk
12/17/17, 1:03 PM - Neville Longbottom: I read Rian Johnson said basically that JJ has the ability to come in for the next one and say that reys parents are obi wan and etc...
12/17/17, 1:03 PM - Hermione Granger: I'm sure he does
12/17/17, 1:03 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: But then was talking during the whole movie about how cool it was. And got mad when I said jar jar is my favorite char
12/17/17, 1:03 PM - Neville Longbottom: That he basically was allowed carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with her lineage but he can't speak to what happens in the next one
12/17/17, 1:04 PM - Luna Lovegood: Classic
12/17/17, 1:05 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahaha
12/17/17, 1:06 PM - Hermione Granger: After the movie the dude literally jumped up and said "fuck yeah Rian Johnson. Alright so now it goes empire, a new hope, last Jedi!..."
12/17/17, 1:10 PM - Luna Lovegood: Amazing
12/18/17, 1:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: "But the bigger thing was, if you look at for example, the Vader ‚ÄúI am your Father‚Äù moment from Empire [Strikes Back], I think that moment‚Äôs so powerful because it‚Äôs the hardest possible thing that Luke and the audience could hear at that moment.  It takes away the easy answers basically.  We thought he was just a bad guy that we could hate and want to kill, but that one sentence and suddenly it‚Äôs more complicated than that.  It‚Äôs harder than that.

If Rey in this movie, if someone had told her yes, here‚Äôs the answer.  You are so and so‚Äôs daughter.  Here‚Äôs your place in this world.  Here you go.  That would be the easiest thing she and the audience could hear.  It would hand her on a silver platter her place in all this.  The hardest thing for all of us to hear and the thing that she doesn‚Äôt wanna hear and maybe we don‚Äôt either is that no, this is not going to be something where it‚Äôs gonna define you.  And the fact that you don‚Äôt have this is gonna be used against you by Kylo to try and pull him into your orbit.  This is gonna be hard.  And you‚Äôre gonna have to stand on your own two feet and define yourself in this story." Johnson on Rey's parentage
12/18/17, 1:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Dang
12/18/17, 1:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Where‚Äôd you read that
12/18/17, 1:13 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I wanna read rian talk about the story
12/18/17, 1:13 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: theres random bits all over on like slashfilm and io9 split annoyingly into different articles
12/18/17, 1:13 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but since my day job is boring as fuck - I'm digging in :D
12/18/17, 1:19 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahaha
12/18/17, 1:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: Let us know what else you find!
12/18/17, 1:34 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Well one thing I didn‚Äôt catch....

12/18/17, 2:04 PM - Hermione Granger: It's wasn't a room guys. It was a Nimbus 2000
12/18/17, 2:05 PM - Luna Lovegood: Lol
12/18/17, 2:34 PM - Neville Longbottom: I caught them both. Have mixed feeling about the books but I already said like first thing to.will that I was stoked on the last scene except that it looked like a Kirkland broom
12/18/17, 2:35 PM - Luna Lovegood: üòÇüòÇ
12/18/17, 2:35 PM - Luna Lovegood: Kirkland broom
12/18/17, 2:37 PM - Severus Snape: üòÇ I'll say this for the hog boss, that kid has good cleaning training. Right after getting yelled at he's like well let me tend to this random leaf pile
12/18/17, 2:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I want a game that instead of your first few powers being like ‚Äúforce choke‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúforce sweep broom‚Äù and you have to level up till you can lead a rebellion on canto bight
12/18/17, 2:40 PM - Luna Lovegood: I'd play that.

12/18/17, 7:51 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: this came out before the movie obviously - but most of their guesses as to how these will influence it are in the right ballpark
12/18/17, 8:50 PM - Neville Longbottom: Will. YES
12/18/17, 8:50 PM - Neville Longbottom: But also
12/18/17, 8:50 PM - Neville Longbottom: https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/a-list-of-some-of-the-times-the-last-jedi-told-the-olde-1821396631

12/18/17, 10:09 PM - Draco Malfoy: It‚Äôs the best Star Wars maybe. Not sure if it‚Äôs better than empire but maybe.
12/18/17, 10:09 PM - Draco Malfoy: And I loved the frog nuns!!!
12/18/17, 10:10 PM - Draco Malfoy: Need to see it again I guess. Empire had more good sad moments
12/18/17, 10:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: It‚Äôs all about the frog nuns and the milk beasts
12/18/17, 10:11 PM - Draco Malfoy: That milk looked so nourishing
12/18/17, 10:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I loved Luke‚Äôs routine
12/18/17, 10:12 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: How do I get that life
12/18/17, 10:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Giant pole fishing and
Sea cow milking that‚Äôs the life
12/18/17, 10:12 PM - Draco Malfoy: That fish he caught could feed an army
12/18/17, 10:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Guys we are doing it wrong w this City slickin

12/18/17, 10:27 PM - Hermione Granger: I really liked it
12/18/17, 10:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: Loved it
12/18/17, 10:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: 94%
12/18/17, 10:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: Points off for mark Hamill's performance
12/18/17, 10:30 PM - Penelope Clearwater: What? he was great
12/18/17, 10:30 PM - Luna Lovegood: But extra points for the milking
12/18/17, 10:30 PM - Penelope Clearwater: 84
12/18/17, 10:30 PM - Luna Lovegood: I've always hated mark Hamill
12/18/17, 10:30 PM - Penelope Clearwater: He was my fave part. He was like wise but petulant child perfectly mixed
12/18/17, 10:36 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Yeah I thought his performance was super weird and zany but I loved it
12/18/17, 10:48 PM - Neville Longbottom: What
12/18/17, 10:48 PM - Neville Longbottom: luna
12/18/17, 10:48 PM - Neville Longbottom: You gotta appreciate the awkwardness
12/18/17, 10:50 PM - Neville Longbottom: Currently my fav behind empire
12/18/17, 10:51 PM - Luna Lovegood: Ok I was harsh. The vibe was fine I get it. Just not into the guy
12/18/17, 10:53 PM - Neville Longbottom: Lol
12/18/17, 10:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: I'm a little burned by the brevity of benicio del Toro's part
12/18/17, 11:37 PM - Neville Longbottom: I honestly think that was a moment where they were trying to make us understand how special the character of Han Solo was...
12/19/17, 6:48 AM - Luna Lovegood: Go on..
12/19/17, 7:13 AM - Hermione Granger: Did you guys know Benicio was supposed to be the voice of darth maul?
12/19/17, 7:14 AM - Hermione Granger: And also play him actually
12/19/17, 7:15 AM - Luna Lovegood: Weird
12/19/17, 7:21 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: Whaaaat
12/19/17, 7:21 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: Toast
12/19/17, 7:21 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: Twist
12/19/17, 7:32 AM - Neville Longbottom: Whoa
12/19/17, 7:32 AM - Hermione Granger: Appearantly he was casted, then. Backed out when GL decided to cut down his screen-time
12/19/17, 7:33 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: That‚Äôs so wizard hermione
12/19/17, 7:34 AM - Neville Longbottom: "When the movie‚Äôs Han Solo-ish Enigmatic Rogue character, DJ, revealed himself not to have a secret heart of gold, but a not-secret-at-all heart of callous self-interest, and he sold the good guys out to the bad guys because the bad guys could pay him more"
12/19/17, 7:47 AM - Hermione Granger: Guys he's gonna come back so hard core
12/19/17, 7:47 AM - Luna Lovegood: I hope so
12/19/17, 7:47 AM - Hermione Granger: He's gonna be the guy that burns it all down, a la Lando in Jedi
12/19/17, 7:50 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: whats super weird is that even though lucas didnt write or direct 5 or 6 he provided a guiding hand IRT story - the only person doin that now is Kathy Kennedy
12/19/17, 7:50 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: like Johnson keeps saying JJ had no say in what he did and he had a blank slate, and that JJ will have the same for 9
12/19/17, 7:51 AM - Hermione Granger: I don't believe that though
12/19/17, 7:51 AM - Neville Longbottom: But didn't JJ have that for 7
12/19/17, 7:51 AM - Hermione Granger: There has to be a dark room with 6 people in suits a Disney stamping shit
12/19/17, 7:51 AM - Hermione Granger: At Disney
12/19/17, 7:52 AM - Luna Lovegood: I googled Kathy Kennedy and realized she produced like 5 of my 10 fave 90s action movies
12/19/17, 7:52 AM - Draco Malfoy: i think it was Hamill's best performance in a star wars (or any) movie
12/19/17, 7:53 AM - Draco Malfoy: and the acting in general was better in this than like any star wars movie ever
12/19/17, 7:55 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah and like a good portion of spielbergs films
12/19/17, 7:56 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: right penelope but I mean like Lucas provided a guiding hand over the original trilogy - Kennedy is the only one doing that now... the fact that she/they let Johnson like explicity veer in a totally diff direction and ignore what JJ obviously cared about is interesting. but its going to be also interesting if she lets JJ veer right back in 9...
12/19/17, 7:56 AM - Hermione Granger: Best acting performance In any Star Wars goes to Frank Oz in Jedi and empire
12/19/17, 7:57 AM - Hermione Granger: Maybe JJ won't want to
12/19/17, 7:57 AM - Draco Malfoy: true.
12/19/17, 7:58 AM - Hermione Granger: Maybe he knew he was just bringing people
Back in the seats
12/19/17, 7:58 AM - Neville Longbottom: Hahahaha
12/19/17, 7:58 AM - Hermione Granger: It's not impossible that he will do something interesting with 9
12/19/17, 7:58 AM - Neville Longbottom: I've liked a lot of jj stuff
12/19/17, 7:59 AM - Hermione Granger: Either way, Snoke is fucking dead
12/19/17, 7:59 AM - Hermione Granger: As long as JJ doesn't force ghost him back
12/19/17, 7:59 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah snoke was like a red herring
12/19/17, 7:59 AM - Hermione Granger: Or come back with a Snoke clone
12/19/17, 7:59 AM - Draco Malfoy: i guess they'll go back a star wars stories about snoke
12/19/17, 8:02 AM - Draco Malfoy: Benecio will also probably have his own stories, right?
12/19/17, 8:02 AM - Draco Malfoy: and Laura Dern
12/19/17, 8:03 AM - Neville Longbottom: Bummed that dern is done
12/19/17, 8:03 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: me too
12/19/17, 8:04 AM - Neville Longbottom: I hope that Johnson's movies don't have any overlaps
12/19/17, 8:04 AM - Neville Longbottom: Maybe just a few Easter egga
12/19/17, 8:05 AM - Neville Longbottom: I feel like benicio is dead tho
12/19/17, 8:06 AM - Draco Malfoy: i think they were setting him up for a backstory or a future story

12/19/17, 8:18 AM - Draco Malfoy: haha bb8 is a real hero in this movie
12/19/17, 8:24 AM - Luna Lovegood: I loved the casino planet
12/19/17, 8:26 AM - Draco Malfoy: this movie had so much in it its insane
12/19/17, 8:26 AM - Draco Malfoy: need to go see it again asap
12/19/17, 8:28 AM - Hermione Granger: severus new theory for you. BB-8 IS Yoda
12/19/17, 8:28 AM - Hermione Granger: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
12/19/17, 8:28 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: if severus doesnt have fan theories he doesnt like star wars
12/19/17, 8:29 AM - Draco Malfoy: i mean Yoda is one with the force so he is everythign.
12/19/17, 8:30 AM - Draco Malfoy: and bb8 might be a more easy vessel for him to channel than, say, a star destroyer.
12/19/17, 8:30 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Ummm I love that theory
12/19/17, 8:41 AM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha
12/19/17, 8:45 AM - Neville Longbottom: But stairs tho
12/19/17, 8:45 AM - Neville Longbottom: I wish Rian made bb8 encounter stairs
12/19/17, 8:48 AM - Penelope Clearwater: You just shattered the franchise but also doesn‚Äôt he in force awakens? He sorta rolls down them one by one? I somehow remember that
12/19/17, 9:01 AM - Neville Longbottom: putting BB8 in front of stairs is like shooting robocop in the chin
12/19/17, 9:02 AM - Draco Malfoy: He can climb stairs it‚Äôs not that hard
12/19/17, 9:02 AM - Draco Malfoy: He has grippy tools
12/19/17, 9:03 AM - Draco Malfoy: Or uses his head
12/19/17, 9:42 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: Neville remember when you called that his head would fall off in Last Jedi????
12/19/17, 9:42 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: at least someone nailed their fan theories
12/19/17, 9:42 AM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha
12/19/17, 9:50 AM - Luna Lovegood: i was really scared when his head popped off.. but then i realized it was magnetically attached. we should use magnetic attachments more IRL
12/19/17, 9:51 AM - Neville Longbottom: totes agree
12/19/17, 9:52 AM - Luna Lovegood: maybe tim cook will see that part and think, "damn, shoulda kept the magnetic power cord on the macbook"
12/19/17, 9:52 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah I would trade my bod for BB8s any day
12/19/17, 9:52 AM - Luna Lovegood: im still so burned they changed that
12/19/17, 9:52 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah that was weird it was like their last great innovation
12/19/17, 9:53 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah but they‚Äôll charge wirelessly soon, right?
12/19/17, 9:53 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: i guess but then you have to have electronic coasters all around the house
12/19/17, 9:55 AM - Draco Malfoy: Unless they develop a cool apple qi charger that works across devices. Which they prob will and try to sell you a bunch of them for a ridiculous price
12/19/17, 10:01 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Guys in our lifetime: phones that charge from the ambient solar light in the room
12/19/17, 10:01 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Also alien contact
12/19/17, 10:01 AM - Penelope Clearwater: I‚Äôm calling it now

12/19/17, 10:18 AM - Luna Lovegood: yea he looked so weird.. everyone on TV looks so weird now
12/19/17, 10:32 AM - Hermione Granger: you guys should read up on wireless charging via ultrasound
12/19/17, 10:46 AM - Luna Lovegood: ok ok.. back 2 the star bros chat
12/19/17, 11:33 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: back to star wars - heres a hot take i've been thinking about that I just tweeted: Men seem very upset about Laura Dern's character. That she 'should have explained' things to Poe and then nothing bad would have happened. This to me is a weird stance to take because: Why would the acting leader of the Resistance be obligated to share every decision she makes with a insubordinate pilot who just got a ton of people killed, destroyed critical equipment, and was recently demoted?

In the middle of a war why would a general take the time to explain to every idiot hot-head soldier why their idiotic hair brained plans are stupid? They would expect the chain of command to function so they could get actual work done.

I find it very telling that men seem extra furious at Holdo for this, when if she were male it would be expected of her to not waste her time with the idiotic ravings of every pilot. But as a female commander she is expected to treat every male under her command w/ reverence.

What is so funny is that this seems to be the EXACT POINT of her character. She offers a counterpoint to the idea that being a reckless hot head is correct and always pays off. Fans' oversized reaction to that to me only proves how much this point needs to be made.

I think it is very telling that inn fans' eyes is it on her to tell Poe everything when she is in command. Should it not be on him to... follow the orders of his commanding officer? Instead of saying "if Holdo had told him everything lives would have been saved the better stance is: "If Poe just followed orders many lives would have been saved." This to me is a quality that makes the film interesting, not a flaw.
12/19/17, 11:33 AM - Draco Malfoy: i just read this on FB
12/19/17, 11:33 AM - Draco Malfoy: who are these crazy people
12/19/17, 11:34 AM - Draco Malfoy: i actually thought, if anything, i was surprised how nice they were to Poe about it
12/19/17, 11:34 AM - Draco Malfoy: BUT couldn't she have done the lightspeed thing earlier and saved a lot more people, if she already knew she was going to die?
12/19/17, 11:35 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: people are like her character not telling poe is the biggest problem w the movie
12/19/17, 11:35 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: it just like proves the point of the character that they feel that
12/19/17, 11:36 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: she could have but that felt like an idea born in desperation when their secret escape was revealed by poe's stupid plan failing
12/19/17, 11:36 AM - Luna Lovegood: yea i really loved the themes or female leadership vs male leadership
12/19/17, 11:36 AM - Draco Malfoy: agree!
12/19/17, 11:37 AM - Luna Lovegood: i thought it was an important distinction... and it was pretty blatant, but it had to be
12/19/17, 11:37 AM - Luna Lovegood: that whole part was like a thought piece
12/19/17, 11:37 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah
12/19/17, 11:37 AM - Luna Lovegood: a teaching moment
12/19/17, 11:37 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: that audience are failing to learn from lol
12/19/17, 11:37 AM - Draco Malfoy: welllll... is that a surprise?
12/19/17, 11:38 AM - Luna Lovegood: true... but as long as we are talking about departures from past star wars, maybe this is a way to depart from the fan base too
12/19/17, 11:39 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: damn meez
12/19/17, 11:39 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: now THATS a hot take i can get into
12/19/17, 11:39 AM - Luna Lovegood: lol
12/19/17, 11:39 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah, I mean when JJ and KK were walking TFA they made a point of trying to make the series more female focused and to appeal to young women more.
12/19/17, 11:39 AM - Draco Malfoy: *walking = talking
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: but i feel FA did it in the very basic way we see in 2017... drop a female in a role that was male before
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: TLJ for me did it in a much more powerful structural storytelling way
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah this was like a full throated morally aligned film
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah, absolutely.
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Luna Lovegood: yea.. it was an essential part of the storytelling
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Penelope Clearwater: I was surprised they forgave Poe for treason
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Luna Lovegood: same
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Just like ‚Äúoh boys will be boys‚Äù
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Penelope Clearwater: He‚Äôs just locker room talking
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah but there are only like 5 people left
12/19/17, 11:40 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: i mean for better or worse hes the best pilot they have and they also only have like 6 pilots
12/19/17, 11:41 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: seems like he's needed, plus hes SUPER SUPER HOT
12/19/17, 11:41 AM - Luna Lovegood: but its also like... "boys will be boys... and now i'm not gonna respect you or promote you ever you treasonous bastard"
12/19/17, 11:41 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Plus he‚Äôs a WHITEMAN
12/19/17, 11:41 AM - Penelope Clearwater: wheatman

12/19/17, 11:43 AM - Draco Malfoy: on McCcarren park
12/19/17, 11:43 AM - Penelope Clearwater: Jrd!

12/19/17, 11:45 AM - Luna Lovegood: omg lol
12/19/17, 11:45 AM - Draco Malfoy: but what is the consensus, what happened to Luke?
12/19/17, 11:46 AM - Luna Lovegood: he's a puddle man and he lives on the island forever until a young island girl smooches his puddle man lips and then he's snoke
12/19/17, 11:46 AM - Penelope Clearwater: yea thats pretty much the consensus
12/19/17, 11:47 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: wait what?
12/19/17, 11:49 AM - Luna Lovegood: jk draco.. i believe he is "dead"
12/19/17, 11:49 AM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah what?? I took Snoke's death at face value-- Snoke was a red herring who is now dead. His rise/backstory will be documented in stories films (prob one between Return and TFA).
12/19/17, 11:49 AM - Luna Lovegood: but will come back as a vision for some chars
12/19/17, 11:50 AM - Draco Malfoy: oh ok. but like did he just die because it was so hard to do that projection of himself
12/19/17, 11:50 AM - Luna Lovegood: yea i was just havin a giggle
12/19/17, 11:50 AM - Luna Lovegood: yea.. he spent the last of his old man energy

12/19/17, 11:51 AM - Draco Malfoy: but there were so many (all good) jokes in this film
12/19/17, 11:52 AM - Luna Lovegood: great jokes indeed... but is there a chill ass char??
12/19/17, 11:52 AM - Draco Malfoy: i think Poe is supposed to be sort of funny but also he's a dick
12/19/17, 11:52 AM - Draco Malfoy: yeah there could be a cooler cat.
12/19/17, 11:53 AM - Draco Malfoy: remember when he was like "holding" at the beginning and messing with the general
12/19/17, 11:53 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: Maz is chill but I dont really like her as a char
12/19/17, 11:54 AM - Draco Malfoy: oh true and she had a really small role in this film.
12/19/17, 11:54 AM - Draco Malfoy: do you think the guy at the baccarat table or whatever with the pin was actually the guy they were looking for?
12/19/17, 11:54 AM - Draco Malfoy: that she sent them to find
12/19/17, 11:56 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: yes
12/19/17, 11:56 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: justin theroux

12/19/17, 12:08 PM - Luna Lovegood: dang harsh
12/19/17, 12:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i mean shes a random fixer/cantina owner her only real connection was to Han who was gone i'm just not sure what part she would play or why it would be worth jumping through hoops to give her a part

12/19/17, 1:00 PM - Luna Lovegood: on the char design: "They came before the porgs and again, that was a one-word brief: ‚Äúpuffin people.‚Äù Okay, so it was more than a one-word brief‚Ä¶two words: ‚Äúpuffin people.‚Äù And then we were told that they were going to be sort of nuns. They were not necessarily a holy order, by like nuns they were an all-female community of indigenous aliens that lived this slightly monastic lifestyle."
12/19/17, 1:01 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Sign me up
12/19/17, 1:03 PM - Luna Lovegood: yea sounds like a pretty good life as long as no young gun wannabe jedis come to the island and start a ruckus knowhatimean????
12/19/17, 1:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Oh. For sure.
12/19/17, 1:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: starbros who wants to go see it again on friday night
12/19/17, 1:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: for mlz bday
12/19/17, 1:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I could slurp that plan down like a bowl of chowder

12/19/17, 1:18 PM - Luna Lovegood: im fattered
12/19/17, 1:36 PM - Neville Longbottom: Just tryna push my cart up the hill
12/19/17, 1:38 PM - Hermione Granger: Damn I would but I'm going to FL
12/19/17, 1:39 PM - Hermione Granger: Guys another reason was the salt ground was an interesting feature. Both us and Kilo failed to notice that Luke didn't leave red footprints
12/19/17, 1:39 PM - Hermione Granger: Like was particularly blinded by his anger
12/19/17, 1:39 PM - Hermione Granger: Kilo*
12/19/17, 1:43 PM - Luna Lovegood: Ooo nice
12/19/17, 1:43 PM - Luna Lovegood: I missed that
12/19/17, 1:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: ohhhhhhh thats so key i missed that too
12/19/17, 1:55 PM - Neville Longbottom: Oh shit
12/19/17, 1:55 PM - Neville Longbottom: Amazing
12/19/17, 1:56 PM - Neville Longbottom: That's incredible
12/19/17, 1:56 PM - Penelope Clearwater: ehh i noticed dat
12/19/17, 1:57 PM - Penelope Clearwater: <Media omitted>
12/19/17, 1:57 PM - Luna Lovegood: egel eye
12/19/17, 1:57 PM - Luna Lovegood: egle
12/19/17, 1:57 PM - Severus Snape: You missed it bc it makes no sense
12/19/17, 1:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: What doesn‚Äôt make sense about it
12/19/17, 1:58 PM - Draco Malfoy: It‚Äôs a foreign planet with rules we don‚Äôt know
12/19/17, 1:58 PM - Luna Lovegood: lol severus
12/19/17, 1:58 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: oh sorry didnt realize that you understood the workings of a mystical made up power
12/19/17, 1:59 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: in a film series about space monks
12/19/17, 1:59 PM - Severus Snape: Yeah it's ok I've been studying the Jedi for a while
12/19/17, 1:59 PM - Hermione Granger: They distinctly made the point of showing footprints there
12/19/17, 1:59 PM - Luna Lovegood: <Media omitted>
12/19/17, 1:59 PM - Penelope Clearwater: the entire red dust
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Penelope Clearwater: device
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Hermione Granger: When you saw the foot and the soldier goes "salt". So it does makes sense severus
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Penelope Clearwater: was made for that purpose
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Draco Malfoy: Wait severus is snoke????
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Luna Lovegood: also salt is highly conductive so it makes sense that he used the conductive powers of the salt to make his astral projection achievable
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Hermione Granger: And also because the ships whizzing my was a cool visual
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Penelope Clearwater: woah mlz
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Hermione Granger: lol lol
12/19/17, 2:00 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: severus will say "but his lightsaber hit kilos" is what he's building up to
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Penelope Clearwater: thats bc lightsabers are made of the fucking force
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Penelope Clearwater: lol i hate how i sound saying that
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Luna Lovegood: kilo THOUGHT his laser sword hit lukes... lukes projection was that good
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Luna Lovegood: couldnt have done it without the salt tho!
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Penelope Clearwater: salt was the real hero of the movie
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Penelope Clearwater: after the salt nuns and bb-8 in the at-st
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Luna Lovegood: i mean.. look at the history of the world man!
12/19/17, 2:01 PM - Penelope Clearwater: woops fish nuns
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah but it made a sound so I guess Luke‚Äôs power ALSO extends to the audience listening in
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: whats really gunna bake your noodle later is he was projecting a saber he didnt even have
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Luna Lovegood: kapow
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Penelope Clearwater: he was also projecitng a younger verison of himself
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Penelope Clearwater: did we cover that
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Penelope Clearwater: a version that kilo would recognize
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Luna Lovegood: like neo in da matrix
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Penelope Clearwater: also an outfit we never saw him wear
12/19/17, 2:02 PM - Hermione Granger: Lol
12/19/17, 2:03 PM - Luna Lovegood: guns

12/19/17, 2:03 PM - Hermione Granger: Egget suit
12/19/17, 2:03 PM - Hermione Granger: Egger (I can't fucking type)
12/19/17, 2:03 PM - Penelope Clearwater: his outfit while he was projecting was diff then the one he wore on the salt planet
12/19/17, 2:03 PM - Penelope Clearwater: i think one was white and one was black
12/19/17, 2:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: he could have projected himself as a fucking space nun for all he wanted
12/19/17, 2:05 PM - Hermione Granger: Can we all be Italian frog nuns for Halloween ?
12/19/17, 2:05 PM - Hermione Granger: I think that would make me happy
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think they‚Äôre more Irish but ok
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Penelope Clearwater: their language was pretty italian sounding
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Hermione Granger: The island looked more Irish
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Hermione Granger: But they acted more Italian to me üòâ
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Penelope Clearwater: the island is in ireland i think
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Draco Malfoy: Well it‚Äôs Ireland
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: tru tru
12/19/17, 2:06 PM - Hermione Granger: So was their attitude
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah I see what you mean yeah
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Penelope Clearwater: could be turkish
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Neville Longbottom: I feel this
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Penelope Clearwater: i know lots of tiny women like that in turkey
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Penelope Clearwater: doing laundry and complaining in a chorus
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Hermione Granger: They had nonna bodies
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha yep
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Penelope Clearwater: sort of a mediterrenean nonna vibe
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: Irish nuns are scarier
12/19/17, 2:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: <Media omitted>
12/19/17, 2:08 PM - Neville Longbottom: <Media omitted>
12/19/17, 2:08 PM - Hermione Granger: <Media omitted>

12/19/17, 2:10 PM - Penelope Clearwater: actually now that i think of it my grandma looks a lot like the frog nuns
12/19/17, 2:10 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahahahahaha!!!
12/19/17, 2:10 PM - Draco Malfoy: All Mediterranean dna is basically the same
12/19/17, 2:10 PM - Draco Malfoy: So that‚Äôs why
12/19/17, 2:10 PM - Draco Malfoy: My mom has been so shaken by her dna test
12/19/17, 2:11 PM - Draco Malfoy: Cuz she‚Äôs like 1/3 North African/middle eastern or something.
12/19/17, 2:11 PM - Neville Longbottom: hermione where is your head?
12/19/17, 2:11 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah haha that photo is hilarious
12/19/17, 2:11 PM - Hermione Granger: I think another Italian frog nun took the photo and didn't know how to operate the phone camera
12/19/17, 2:11 PM - Hermione Granger: It's also blurry as fuuuucck
12/19/17, 2:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Big question - is @12039186666 gunna see it again w an open mind and open heart
12/19/17, 2:14 PM - Severus Snape: I'll consider seeing it after watching ep 7 to see what that does for me
12/19/17, 2:15 PM - Draco Malfoy: This message was deleted
12/19/17, 2:16 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i recommend the back to back
12/19/17, 2:16 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats what I did and it was very illuminating
12/19/17, 2:16 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah I watched TfA a few days ago
12/19/17, 2:27 PM - Draco Malfoy: can i get a summary of what severus didnt like
12/19/17, 2:28 PM - Severus Snape: Lol. I'm right here
12/19/17, 2:29 PM - Draco Malfoy: if i had said "you" it wouldn't be clear who i was talking about or what i meant.
12/19/17, 2:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: takes more words but this is what i meant: can i get a summary of what you, severus, didn't like?
12/19/17, 2:31 PM - Severus Snape: Later. I'm happy y'all are jazzed (even though this convo has been on mute)
12/19/17, 2:38 PM - Draco Malfoy: lol so to the group: can i get a summary of what severus didnt like
12/19/17, 2:38 PM - Luna Lovegood: dang.
12/19/17, 2:38 PM - Luna Lovegood: dang dang dang.
12/19/17, 2:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I mean... no
12/19/17, 2:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: it was unintelligible the night of and then he clammed up.
12/19/17, 2:39 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Don‚Äôt be mean will
12/19/17, 2:39 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair
12/19/17, 2:40 PM - Penelope Clearwater: It was intelligible you just shouted over him
12/19/17, 2:40 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ok sorry *unintelligible to me*
12/19/17, 2:40 PM - Luna Lovegood: i wanna hear it from severus when he has time
12/19/17, 2:40 PM - Luna Lovegood: sorry... severus, i wanna hear it from you when u have time ;)
12/19/17, 2:41 PM - Draco Malfoy: I was only putting it that way because I assumed it was already argued about in here
12/19/17, 2:41 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: üôÑ saying I shout over people is fine but saying it in reference to severus is balony who was screaming so much winston never got one sentence out and told me about it later
12/19/17, 2:41 PM - Draco Malfoy: Before I joined
12/19/17, 2:43 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: naw it hasnt come up in here just night of
12/19/17, 2:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oh sorry in that case, severus, take your time.
12/19/17, 4:46 PM - Luna Lovegood: What did I guys think about Leia serving outer space
12/19/17, 4:46 PM - Draco Malfoy: Sooooooo was that all force power or do people need to be in space for a while before dying
12/19/17, 4:47 PM - Luna Lovegood: I don't know the exact science but I thought you'd die instantly in space
12/19/17, 4:48 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah But in Star Wars I think the rules are flexible with that
12/19/17, 4:48 PM - Draco Malfoy: So it‚Äôs a combination of that and force power.
12/19/17, 4:48 PM - Luna Lovegood: Cool
12/19/17, 4:48 PM - Draco Malfoy: But I didn‚Äôt love that
12/19/17, 4:48 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I think in our space which we're already not in you can survive like 20 seconds in sapce
12/19/17, 4:48 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and force power def kicked in to guide her back to ship and presumably keep her alive
12/19/17, 4:49 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i didnt mind it - if luke can lift an xwing w the force leia should be powerful enough to move a weightless version of herself
12/19/17, 4:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: I was just surprised she didn‚Äôt die earlier
12/19/17, 4:50 PM - Luna Lovegood: Yea that's my question
12/19/17, 4:51 PM - Luna Lovegood: But I'll take the force explanation. She's badass
12/19/17, 4:52 PM - Luna Lovegood: I guess the camera paused for a moment on her face right before she was sucked out and she looked pretty serene. So I guess she was tapping into that sweet sweet force powa
12/19/17, 4:52 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah I think that shot was slow motion
12/19/17, 4:52 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: if i remember correctly you could see the ice particles move around her
12/19/17, 4:52 PM - Luna Lovegood: I have the same face when I'm about to drop a really solid poo
12/19/17, 4:52 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: which i took to mean she was like creating a safety bubble
12/19/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: oh yeah
12/19/17, 4:53 PM - Luna Lovegood: She was turning into a salt fox
12/19/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: omg i wish
12/19/17, 4:53 PM - Luna Lovegood: Crystal salt fox
12/19/17, 4:54 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: hey guys I'm a crystal salt fox now, you'll have to do the battles without me I just want to chill and sniff things
12/19/17, 4:55 PM - Luna Lovegood: #saltlife
12/19/17, 4:56 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i rewatched prisoner of azkaban for the first time since theaters the other day..... it holds up
12/19/17, 4:56 PM - Luna Lovegood: So good

12/19/17, 8:28 PM - Luna Lovegood: I'm digging the author read
12/19/17, 8:29 PM - Luna Lovegood: Reminds me of the boneshack days and various events surround said shack of bones
12/19/17, 8:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah some parts of it for sure
12/19/17, 8:35 PM - Luna Lovegood: Oh wow. Less parts than I thought. That escalated

12/19/17, 10:15 PM - Penelope Clearwater: TLS*
12/19/17, 10:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I just listened to cat person god damn men r the worst are most men like this
12/19/17, 10:19 PM - Luna Lovegood: I think a lot of men, including myself, have exhibited some of these characteristics
12/19/17, 10:19 PM - Luna Lovegood: Dunno how extreme the particular case was
12/19/17, 10:20 PM - Luna Lovegood: But I gotta think it happens way more than we think
12/19/17, 10:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I mean the ending
12/19/17, 10:21 PM - Luna Lovegood: The ending is beyond imaginable for any of us to do. But I don't think it's like extremely rare. I think it happens
12/19/17, 10:23 PM - Penelope Clearwater: So who is the cat person being compared to
12/19/17, 10:25 PM - Luna Lovegood: Um me. Like all the dumb insecurities that I felt while running around the city in my 20s
12/19/17, 10:26 PM - Penelope Clearwater: yea tehinsecure inner dialogue was prettty spot on
12/19/17, 10:27 PM - Draco Malfoy: I felt a connection to both characters
12/19/17, 10:28 PM - Luna Lovegood: Interesting
12/19/17, 10:29 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I did too jrd. I have def felt rly awkward and disconnected around girls and feared they were having the exact inner dialogue she was having
12/19/17, 10:29 PM - Penelope Clearwater: But usually when I feel that way I stop seeing the person
12/19/17, 10:30 PM - Penelope Clearwater: V powerful story
12/19/17, 10:30 PM - Penelope Clearwater: The narration was great
12/19/17, 10:31 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I rly hated Robert bc I saw what I saw in him what fear myself to be
12/19/17, 10:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: Yea
12/19/17, 10:31 PM - Penelope Clearwater: What I fear myself to be*
12/19/17, 10:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: Same
12/19/17, 10:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: But I think/hope we are more sensitive and aware than him
12/19/17, 10:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: lol I hope
12/19/17, 10:32 PM - Luna Lovegood: Same

12/20/17, 11:57 AM - Neville Longbottom: You guys I saw an article today about how star wars blew it by allowing one person (the dern) to pilot that giant ship all by herself
12/20/17, 11:57 AM - Neville Longbottom: People are ridiculous
12/20/17, 11:58 AM - Draco Malfoy: lol, reasonable to ask, though, why the normally need so many people in the bridge when someone can just do it themselves. but its easy to come up with answers that work.

12/20/17, 12:53 PM - Severus Snape: Love his writing. It's a good summary of why I dislike the film. Not surprising since I'm basically the standin for people not liking the film üòÇüòÇüòÇ
12/20/17, 12:53 PM - Severus Snape: I'll elaborate later. Gotta play canasta now
12/20/17, 12:53 PM - Luna Lovegood: wow severus, ur really teasing us here
12/20/17, 12:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: so, in that article, every time winston is like "such and such happened and this is why i think the movie is good" you're like "such and such happened and this is why i think the movie bad"?
12/20/17, 12:55 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Winston is like insanely good at these articles

12/20/17, 2:29 PM - Neville Longbottom: I guess you're in your room painting
12/20/17, 2:29 PM - Severus Snape: Lol reading it back makes no sense. One too many selves
12/20/17, 2:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: making sense doesnt matter only the emotional experience matters
12/20/17, 2:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: THATS WHAT IM TRYING TO SAY
12/20/17, 2:30 PM - Neville Longbottom: <Media omitted>
12/20/17, 2:38 PM - Severus Snape: I should top ten the aughts and see if wxrashers makes it
12/20/17, 4:30 PM - Luna Lovegood: I just wanna finally hear your take!
12/20/17, 4:36 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah!! Same, I never meant to imply otherwise.
12/20/17, 6:26 PM - Severus Snape: The summary is one I did not like the movie. The Humor fell flat. The plotting was low Marvel tier. The writing was cloying. So even as a "Star Wars Story" I would've left the theater nonplussed. Can you hear me now is not a good way for a movie to engender itself to me. And then only one bomber limps through a characterless fighter battle? I wasn't shocked. The movie did not make strides to improve its impression from that Captain America level for me from there. I don't think it benefits any of us for me to go through each and every scene and point to the exact moment I rolled my eyes. More overall, the movie felt cliched to me.  The problem for me Isn't that the movie was not Star Wars enough  the problem for me is that it was too Star Wars. the wise Master doesn't want to teach the young pupil and then eventually agrees to? The good guy has a chance to join the bad guy and create the universe that they want and then daringly turns them down? every character is ready and willing to sacrifice themselves at any moment and does? The bad guy is full of impotent rage and infinite resources and a non-existent leadership caste? I felt like I was wasting my time with a color by numbers. Two it left me with no sense of mystery. it's not my fault there's an 8 in front of the title. fine, tear down everything that came before, and then I want something else to take its place to feed me. But I left the theater wondering about nothing interested in nothing with no sense of the larger universe or mythology orIntrigue. The resistance left one planet, arrived at another planet, lost 90% of its forces which I thought it had just lost 90% of in the last movie, Rey is still a Dusty slave girl that can move things, the casino Planet doesn't even give a shit that any of this stuff happened.  Galaxy wise, nothing has changed since the last movie. Especially if we are supposed to take into consideration that Luke wasn't going to do shit anyways if left to his devices and that's snike was useless (something this movie carefully showed). Is that different from Empire?, where we left the movie in worse shape than we started? Yes, it's different because Han was captured, because we found out Vader was the father, because we met Yoda and learned what it means to be a Jedi (jedi are just samurai in EP four). Because we learned from Yoda that there is another hope! Do I immediately get tarred in your mind for bringing up an old Star Wars film? Because I'm a fan boy? Okay, then remove the paragraph and Last Jedi still doesn't stand on its own for me. Winston writes that my criticism is that nothing happened. And as I said at the time it basically had the amount of plot development of what I'd expect from a CGI animated half-hour television episode. and then to take two and a half hours and not build for me anything of mystery anything of to question, that is not a redeeming quality for me. I don't leave The Italian Job parentheses 2004 close parentheses saying gee I'm so pleased I don't have to think about anything else that happens to those characters into that world now that the movie's over. 3 and related to 2 is that I also leave the movie with no feeling of magic. I don't have a planet, a ship, a weapon, a new character, a new race that actually says a line, a new bad guy, a new good guy, a memorable line. Does this make for An Actual Film? (Negative credit to my good friend will for infecting Winston and popular culture by turn with this turn of phrase that he knows is awful despite bein useful). Does it make it a Star Wars film for people that aren't fans of Star Wars? Neither, to me it makes it unmemorable and uninteresting. my OGs kno that you will find no bigger defender of Return of the Jedi since 1991 than me, a flawed film. And this film felt most similar to that one, both in plotting and in design. and maybe I fall into a trap by looking at Jedi because I open up to well you're just a Star Wars fan stuck in the past. Okay fine, let's open up valerian, my favorite film from this year Valerian and return are films that succeed at being capital a actual films for me because they live and breathe the things they create, And they create them because they deserve to exist in the world I'm being shown. When the commentary in here is how awesome are porgs? Hashtag porg life hashtag porg Nation, do I chime in and say I didn't think they were awesome? Do I chime in and say that if you want to create a race or characters that are supposed to matter to me, then I need more substance than what I saw in the Last Jedi? Because I do, because I know it's possible, because Valerian has a thousand races and a dozen memorable characters that all live lives and deliver lines and feed the film's world and me the viewer. Submarine Captain, the three secret Keepers, Herbie Hancock, fuckin BIG MARKET, Etc. Is it a coincidence that these characters come from a 30-year history of the comic books that preceded the movie? No, because the artist Infuse those characters with life using care and time and the director respected that life when bringing them to film. my only comment before the movie, as hyped as I was for it, was that I was afraid I was being marketed porgs already and I didn't want characters that just pop in front of the camera and open theirmouths and that's what we got. My other comment was that Snokes capital ship looks lame and uninteresting and I was afraid for the design, and I feel let down there overall too. Does every new movie need Wacky Races and ships and planets to be good? No, but if you're going to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy me then I need the actual movie to have substance and Intrigue and a reason to watch it. And if you want to just do some bullshit? Then Thor 3 left me more satisfied. Lastly, and perhaps most controversially for will, is that I did not believe the motivations of the characters and I did not believe their growth. Do I have to pitch battle bc I don't know what I'm talking about re writing? I did not believe Luke's sulk turn. I did not believe holdos he's a good kid turn. I did not believe rens smoke turn. I did not believe rens constant snarl. I did not believe Rose I saved you dummy turn. It's not that I don't believe that the characters would do those things or change to do those things, its that the plotting drove me to not feel that the characters actually made decisions to do those things. I felt the cliche, that these were written from above, not thought of by the characters. Is that bc of 1 through 4? Yeah, the movie was not getting the benefit of generous film-viewership from me. And this is important to me re the writing also: if you're going to damn durn me then fucking damn dern me. Fucking big little lies me and durn the fucking shit out of me  I don't want a softball Dern I don't want to softball benicio. Dern was an aunt in charge of a ship. Smoke was a purposeless snarl. Benicio was an in and out jafar. Rose wishes she was worthy of Hufflepuff. Too tame, too Star Warstm a Disneytm property, I wanted to be ravaged by these chars. In conclusion, two and a half hours with nothing much happening and nothing much for me to be interested in and infused with cliche and can you hear me now throughout, and I don't shy away from saying that there is pain for me bc I think it was a wasted opportunity to throw out the old stuff (EP 7 I mean)
12/20/17, 6:31 PM - Severus Snape: Does all this make me angry? No, it makes me Melancholy like I wrote on Facebook. What does anger me is that I think people, yourselves included, are too forgiving on world-building and storytelling that I feel is fundamentally flawed. that gets to me because I know that better is possible. And the world wants dumber and easier and stupider. And I don't want to give into that  I'm the it's still real to me dammit guy. Don Quixote as possible. Lord of the Rings as possible. Excalibur is possible. Terminator is possible. Id4 is possible. The wire is possible.i want more and I don't want to be alone in that because no one makes things only for me (yet)
12/20/17, 6:31 PM - Severus Snape: Fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering.
12/20/17, 7:25 PM - Luna Lovegood: command+p

12/20/17, 7:30 PM - Penelope Clearwater: This fire needed some low lying brush
12/20/17, 7:32 PM - Severus Snape: And no luna I wrote this speech to text in WhatsApp lol
12/20/17, 7:32 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Brutal

12/20/17, 7:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: This is v helpful thx
12/20/17, 7:34 PM - Luna Lovegood: i do agree wit dis "Dern was an aunt in charge of a ship. Benicio was an in and out jafar."
12/20/17, 7:37 PM - Luna Lovegood: <Media omitted>
12/20/17, 7:37 PM - Luna Lovegood: i was DEAD when i saw that today
12/20/17, 7:41 PM - Severus Snape: Oh my fucking God
12/20/17, 7:42 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: reading it in dern voice happens so naturally
12/20/17, 7:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: anyone who read on google doc it was missing a section - fixed it
12/20/17, 8:09 PM - Luna Lovegood: I also made a design edit
12/20/17, 8:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I liked that
12/20/17, 8:27 PM - Draco Malfoy: But severus, how did you feel about Cat Person?
12/20/17, 8:27 PM - Severus Snape: I liked it
12/20/17, 8:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: severus I feel like your criticism is very Armand White.
12/20/17, 8:33 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: üòÇI told severus he was going Armond White when left the theater after Valerian
12/20/17, 8:33 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: *when we
12/20/17, 8:41 PM - Severus Snape: What's the takeaway of that Jesus?
12/20/17, 9:52 PM - Luna Lovegood: Who is armond white
12/20/17, 10:12 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: He‚Äôs this film critic that will have often champion hated movies and bash critically acclaimed ones. The example on wiki is he argued I now pronounce you chuck and Larry to be a better gay film than brokeback mountain. People used to think he was trolling but the general consensus now is that he just has a value system for what he cares about in films that is super unique esoteric and hard to understand by anyone that isn‚Äôt him
12/20/17, 10:16 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yeah Will is right. He‚Äôs a gay black man and hated moonlight
12/20/17, 10:16 PM - Draco Malfoy: Gave it like the only bad review
12/20/17, 10:17 PM - Draco Malfoy: But like his criticism is like respected
12/20/17, 10:18 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I think like before he died ebert called him a troll then later apologized and basically was like. No I think he believes everything he says he‚Äôs not a troll he‚Äôs just insane
12/20/17, 10:19 PM - Draco Malfoy: I recorded him for an episode of the Canon podcast and he was a gentleman and friendly.
12/20/17, 10:19 PM - Neville Longbottom: I loved cat person
12/20/17, 10:19 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hated the girl reading the audio
12/20/17, 10:19 PM - Draco Malfoy: Armand White probably hates Cat Person.
12/20/17, 10:21 PM - Neville Longbottom: It sounded like Allison Williams reading
12/20/17, 10:23 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Armond White on last Jedi: ‚ÄúKylo gets reduced to Good-versus-Evil pouting. (Hey, it was only patricide!) Instead of achieving grand operatic depth or the emotional intensity of Fritz Lang‚Äôs Die Niebelugend and John Boorman‚Äôs Excalibur‚Äù both he and severus referenced Excalibur... which I‚Äôve seen 5 times and has nothing to do with last Jedi üòÇ
12/20/17, 10:23 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ‚ÄúThe Last Jedi falls short of the visionary excitement that distinguishes Justice League or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.‚Äù
12/20/17, 10:24 PM - Severus Snape: Ok that's pretty lol wow
12/20/17, 10:24 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Unreal
12/20/17, 10:25 PM - Draco Malfoy: Wow tho
12/20/17, 10:26 PM - Severus Snape: ...yeah. Well I wrote what I wrote for reasons and so did he I guess
12/20/17, 10:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: severus is less alt-right leaning than white has become but the random overlap in the Star Wars review is pretty great. Only a severus or Armond White could throw out don quixote and id4 in the same breath as two great examples of anything. In short... I‚Äôm ready for your film blog and what can I do to make it happen
12/20/17, 10:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: ü§ë
12/20/17, 10:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: penelope The girl reading it was the author
12/20/17, 10:32 PM - Severus Snape: I dunno but I guess engage with my thots
12/20/17, 10:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: Author reads are usually bad
12/20/17, 10:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: But I haven‚Äôt heard it yet
12/20/17, 10:33 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I liked her read more bc I knew she wrote it. If I didn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd dislike it more
12/20/17, 10:33 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I will if you go back and read the thousand of messages I posted about it and engage with those ü§ì
12/20/17, 10:34 PM - Severus Snape: I didn't get those in Google docs app
12/20/17, 10:34 PM - Severus Snape: Oh you mean in this chat?
12/20/17, 10:34 PM - Draco Malfoy: Going to üõè
12/20/17, 10:35 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Yeah lol
12/20/17, 10:35 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: The problem is there is no engaging bc there are no rules of engagement. It‚Äôs clear our entire film value systems are totally different. What matters to you is nonsense to me and I imagine vice verse
12/20/17, 10:35 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Versa
12/20/17, 10:37 PM - Severus Snape: I think that's a cop out
12/20/17, 10:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Lol well I‚Äôm not going back and finding all the stuff I already wrote here
12/20/17, 10:38 PM - Severus Snape: You asked what you could do to make the blog happen so I answered
12/20/17, 10:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: The blog is us fighting about movies? I
12/20/17, 10:40 PM - Severus Snape: Well it could be but I meant more to push my thinking instead of keeping me in a zoo with this almond fellow
12/20/17, 10:41 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I mean he writes for national review and out magazine and has had a very good career within his field...
12/20/17, 10:42 PM - Severus Snape: What about it?
12/20/17, 10:43 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: That‚Äôs pretty good for an almond
12/20/17, 10:43 PM - Luna Lovegood: Sometimes u feel like a nut
12/20/17, 10:45 PM - Severus Snape: I know but you're not engaging his thoughts either. I don't actually need to be engaged (lies) but if you want me to make a blog then I want feedback üòÇ otherwise nbd I'll just stay u guys pet almond
12/20/17, 10:45 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I mean... I kind of win either way?
12/21/17, 6:50 AM - Draco Malfoy: I‚Äôve never seen a marvel movie so your essay doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, Tbh.
12/21/17, 6:57 AM - Draco Malfoy: But that kind of like high minded whackamole jibberish reminded me of Armand white.
12/21/17, 7:51 AM - Luna Lovegood: <Media omitted>
12/21/17, 9:14 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: Might actually be hard to get Star Wars tickets on Friday ü§≠

12/21/17, 1:05 PM - Hermione Granger: So much can be dont with that
12/21/17, 1:08 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think they should make kylo trans
12/21/17, 1:09 PM - Luna Lovegood: I don't want them to hookup
12/21/17, 1:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: they def had more sexual energy than any other pair in like.... any star wars movie
12/21/17, 1:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I think it could be explored in a cool way
12/21/17, 1:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: cuz they also hate each other

12/21/17, 1:11 PM - Draco Malfoy: Hahaha great moment. Sand reminds him of his mom and her death drove him to the dark side. So sand is kind of like a representation of how evil percolates into everything and is hard to get rid of.
12/21/17, 1:12 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ok
12/21/17, 1:12 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i need to watch the prequels with jared's live commentary

12/21/17, 1:16 PM - Hermione Granger: And have a threesome
12/21/17, 1:16 PM - Hermione Granger: (I think I just heard Neville coming)
12/21/17, 1:16 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Hnnnggggfff
12/21/17, 1:16 PM - Hermione Granger: Hahahaha
12/21/17, 3:49 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: remember how kilo turned to the darkside bc he thought luke was going to murder him
12/21/17, 3:49 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: that was so dope
12/21/17, 3:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: ha i'd say that plot point might fall into the michael's right category
12/21/17, 3:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i liked it
12/21/17, 3:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: some light roshomon shit
12/21/17, 3:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: a momentary misunderstanding setting two people on a diverging path
12/21/17, 3:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and luke being so culpable
12/21/17, 3:54 PM - Hermione Granger: It's actually very Looper
12/21/17, 3:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: true
12/21/17, 3:55 PM - Luna Lovegood: yea i liked it
12/21/17, 3:56 PM - Draco Malfoy: how do you think they're going to deal with Leia in ep 9?
12/21/17, 3:56 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I think they 100% wont kill her
12/21/17, 3:57 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: unless they do some massive jump forward in time which is unlikely
12/21/17, 3:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: but they won't do Tarkin rogue 1 shit right, please, no.
12/21/17, 3:57 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i dont think so
12/21/17, 3:58 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i think she'll be doing super impt shit that just doesn't intersect with Kilo
12/21/17, 4:02 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: they do almost infinite things w audio now so they could easily have her communicate vocally
12/21/17, 4:02 PM - Draco Malfoy: wait you think they can more easily replicate her voice than her face?
12/21/17, 4:03 PM - Draco Malfoy: is that true?
12/21/17, 4:03 PM - Luna Lovegood: yea man.. have u seen those videos where they sample a voice and make it say a completely new ting
12/21/17, 4:03 PM - Luna Lovegood: pretty scary
12/21/17, 4:03 PM - Luna Lovegood: but kewl for movies
12/21/17, 4:04 PM - Draco Malfoy: with the adobe software?
12/21/17, 4:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: well that - plus yeah voice data is much simpler... and they can take all the audio they have of her from every shot from the last 2 movies
12/21/17, 4:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: every take every cut scene
12/21/17, 4:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: etc.
12/21/17, 4:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: to frankenstein stuff together
12/21/17, 4:04 PM - Draco Malfoy: eh i dunno i think  its hard to fake an emotive performance even with that software.
12/21/17, 4:05 PM - Draco Malfoy: but im biased
12/21/17, 4:05 PM - Luna Lovegood: i mean.. u would know lol
12/21/17, 4:05 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats probably true I dont even mean w the software
12/21/17, 4:05 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: just stringing lines together. they def did it for pick up ADR on last jedi
12/21/17, 4:06 PM - Draco Malfoy: yeah they could do that if she just has some short lines
12/21/17, 4:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: i think they'd be more likely to find a sound a like
12/21/17, 4:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: and use a combination of the two
12/21/17, 4:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: the thing is-- if they do any of that, they'll need to have a press plan for it
12/21/17, 4:08 PM - Draco Malfoy: like they need their Wired magazine PR plan worked out
12/21/17, 4:10 PM - Severus Snape: Why would luke consider murdering someone in their sleep?
12/21/17, 4:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: to stop another vader
12/21/17, 4:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i mean you litereally thought luke was snoke so.....
12/21/17, 4:11 PM - Penelope Clearwater: i think Rey goes bad
12/21/17, 4:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: which would mean he killed like 5 billion people many who were asleep
12/21/17, 4:12 PM - Luna Lovegood: :(((((((
12/21/17, 4:13 PM - Severus Snape: Why would the Luke in the movie do that
12/21/17, 4:14 PM - Severus Snape: The things I said presumed storytelling before they happened
12/21/17, 4:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: [5:11 PM, 12/21/2017] +1 (203) 273-4690: to stop another vader
12/21/17, 4:16 PM - Severus Snape: So we're to assume luke is evil bc he is jury and executioner bc of things luke imagines?
12/21/17, 4:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i dont know what you mean - again you thought he was going to have killed 5 billion people
12/21/17, 4:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: so you taking some holy stance on luke now doesnt make sesne to me
12/21/17, 4:18 PM - Severus Snape: That's bullshit Will. In my idea he was going to turn evil bc he thought "balance" eg moderates was good. And it would require storytelling to justify
12/21/17, 4:19 PM - Severus Snape: In the actual film he is supposed to be good but that was clearly an evil act
12/21/17, 4:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: right...
12/21/17, 4:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: hence his decades of regret
12/21/17, 4:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and isolation
12/21/17, 4:20 PM - Severus Snape: So I'm not supposed to be on his side
12/21/17, 4:21 PM - Severus Snape: Bc all I see of the character is an evil act that precipitates all the bad shit
12/21/17, 4:21 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: You can be on whoever side you want... I'm sorry that morally grey characters who make mistakes are too much for you to process
12/21/17, 4:21 PM - Severus Snape: How is it gray?
12/21/17, 4:22 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: luke saved the galaxy multiple times, he also considered murdering a child
12/21/17, 4:22 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: light, dark = gray
12/21/17, 4:24 PM - Severus Snape: Right, so we're never shown why a character that wholly represents the light side would do something clearly dark side
12/21/17, 4:24 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ? to stop another vader ?
12/21/17, 4:24 PM - Severus Snape: It just happens with zero background
12/21/17, 4:25 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: what background would you have preferred? like Kilo Ren force choking porgs? we already know he has evil in him he killed his father
12/21/17, 4:25 PM - Severus Snape: It's a dark side act like you said
12/21/17, 4:25 PM - Severus Snape: That was precipitated by Luke's betrayal
12/21/17, 4:26 PM - Severus Snape: He can't be prefaulted for that
12/21/17, 4:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: lol
12/21/17, 4:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats not why luke did it but luke could do that to another char and they wouldnt later kill their dad bc of it
12/21/17, 4:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: so the audience can infer and understand that he has darkness in him
12/21/17, 4:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: w/o scenes of him shooting force lightning at milk beasts
12/21/17, 4:27 PM - Draco Malfoy: <Media omitted>
12/21/17, 4:29 PM - Severus Snape: So our first intro to ren chronologically is sleeping and the audience is supposed to know he's evil? Bc of future behavior? Thats minority report nonsense to me
12/21/17, 4:29 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: lol
12/21/17, 4:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: film chronology and temporal chronology haven't been the same since like 1903
12/21/17, 4:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the audience experiences the film as it unrolls, and juices up on information chronologically
12/21/17, 4:30 PM - Draco Malfoy: ha but also he may not have been evil, but Luke feared he was evil and Luke's action is what may have turned him evil. it's more like Looper than minority report.
12/21/17, 4:30 PM - Severus Snape: Ok. So people in this universe are born evil? Or evil based just on thoughts?
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: NO Luke saw his future, in which he was evil
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: so Luke contemplated killing him
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Draco Malfoy: but thats what turned him evil
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Severus Snape: Right
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: or at least was the catalyst
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Luna Lovegood: +1
12/21/17, 4:31 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: we dont know what would have happened if he didnt
12/21/17, 4:32 PM - Severus Snape: So why did Luke do that was my question. Bc the only thing the audience sees Luke do is a disgusting despicable act
12/21/17, 4:32 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: "to stop another vader"
12/21/17, 4:32 PM - Draco Malfoy: I'm pretty sure the implication is that Luke sees in Kylo Ren what he knew happened to his father.
12/21/17, 4:33 PM - Severus Snape: And the audience is supposed to be sympathetic to that? It's horrific
12/21/17, 4:33 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I mean that's what makes it interesting
12/21/17, 4:33 PM - Draco Malfoy: No you don't have to be sympathetic-- we're supposed to see it as a (maybe unforgivable) mistake that Luke made.
12/21/17, 4:36 PM - Luna Lovegood: yea, that's what i felt... its a huge flaw in luke's char, which makes his self imposed isolation that much heavier
12/21/17, 4:37 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: you're like describing the interesting dilemma and crisis in the character...
12/21/17, 4:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: probably the best like soupy mess of a hero failing that exists in starwars, functioning far better and more emotionally richly than yoda or obi wans failures at the end of the prequels
12/21/17, 4:38 PM - Draco Malfoy: But also-- Luke doesn't actually do a disgusting despicable act. He gets ready to and decides not to, or at least claims he decides not to.
12/21/17, 4:39 PM - Severus Snape: I don't get how it's emotionally rich when it happens with zero background. There's no ability for me to see why Luke made a mistake bc it's voice overed in thirty seconds
12/21/17, 4:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: what background do you need?
12/21/17, 4:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I dont understand
12/21/17, 4:39 PM - Draco Malfoy: fair enough, they could've shown shots from Ep III
12/21/17, 4:40 PM - Draco Malfoy: jk lol
12/21/17, 4:40 PM - Luna Lovegood: lul
12/21/17, 4:40 PM - Severus Snape: Why Luke thought these insane despicable things. As far as we knew the character up until then he was the paragon of virtue
12/21/17, 4:41 PM - Severus Snape: The master Jedi had no defense against ends oriented thinking, literally the most evil thing?
12/21/17, 4:42 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: why do we need to see that?
12/21/17, 4:42 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: what does that bring to the narrative?
12/21/17, 4:42 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think the idea is Luke started his Jedi school thinking he could bring about a new era where the Jedi have a code that keeps them in line and doesn't allow their power to get overused. Then he starts to question himself.
12/21/17, 4:42 PM - Severus Snape: Emotional depth, for me
12/21/17, 4:42 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: we know why he did it
12/21/17, 4:42 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats obvious and doesnt matter
12/21/17, 4:43 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: what matters is that he did it and how it has affected him
12/21/17, 4:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: Because without all the necessary strictures, the Jedi or people with strong force power and skills, become evil.
12/21/17, 4:43 PM - Draco Malfoy: It was Luke becoming overconfident and then realizing it and questioning himself.
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: "I can build a new school for Jedi and rebuild this institution without it becoming evil" .. "oh wait shit, I can't do that, I'm a single man"
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Severus Snape: Him jumping to murder was not believable for me at that point
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: but he didnt
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: he contemplated it
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: and then backed down
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: (or at least claims to)
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Severus Snape: Attempted murder. You don't open a lightsaber
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: its not attempted murder
12/21/17, 4:44 PM - Draco Malfoy: because he claims he wasn't going to do it
12/21/17, 4:45 PM - Draco Malfoy: but kylo saw the open lightsaber before Luke was able to walk away
12/21/17, 4:45 PM - Severus Snape: Ren was forced to defend himself
12/21/17, 4:45 PM - Draco Malfoy: no, he thought he was
12/21/17, 4:45 PM - Draco Malfoy: unless Luke in the future is lying and he was actually going to do it.
12/21/17, 4:46 PM - Neville Longbottom: Zero background
12/21/17, 4:46 PM - Neville Longbottom: What do you need a step-by-step analysis of what went down for the past 25 years
12/21/17, 4:46 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: its called "backstory" for a reason
12/21/17, 4:46 PM - Severus Snape: I need to believe that the Paragon of virtue thinks murder is acceptable
12/21/17, 4:46 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: he's only a paragon of virtue for your bro
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: stop being such a neckbeard about luke
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Severus Snape: You brought that up will
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Neville Longbottom: Agreed slater
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Severus Snape: You said he saved the Galaxy multiple times. I didn't
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: he didd
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: that doesnt make him paragon of virtue
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: how are those related for you?
12/21/17, 4:47 PM - Severus Snape: Bc you said he was light side
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Severus Snape: It's called the friggin light side
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Neville Longbottom: severus luke was always too old to train, a bit of a hot head and too quick in his jumping to conclusions
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Neville Longbottom: As pointed out by Mr yoda
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: so he should be like a fucking prequels character?
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: just like bland and monk-ish b/c he's "light side"
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Draco Malfoy: but prequels jedi do tons of bad shit
12/21/17, 4:48 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hahaha
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: +1
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Severus Snape: Right I agree. Except murder
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Neville Longbottom: Just a quick flirt
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Severus Snape: Literally the act Anakin did to turn dark
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Draco Malfoy: but also isnt the point kind of that luke has some dark in him too that he needs to fight off?
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Neville Longbottom: I just literally lost my car in the target lot
12/21/17, 4:49 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: +1
12/21/17, 4:50 PM - Neville Longbottom: But I found it it's cool
12/21/17, 4:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: and that moment - where he *contemplates* murder when his dark side was almost taking over
12/21/17, 4:50 PM - Neville Longbottom: +2
12/21/17, 4:50 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: like the point of jedi is he contemplates murdering the emperor
12/21/17, 4:50 PM - Draco Malfoy: EXACTLY
12/21/17, 4:51 PM - Neville Longbottom: And he doesn't even get a chance to fully make that decision
12/21/17, 4:51 PM - Draco Malfoy: and the irony of it is that the dark side ends up sort of winning over kylo in that moment
12/21/17, 4:51 PM - Severus Snape: The movie shows that as him contemplating murder to stop someone contemplating murder. It's moral sludge. Exactly draco
12/21/17, 4:51 PM - Severus Snape: It's ironic
12/21/17, 4:52 PM - Luna Lovegood: lul
12/21/17, 4:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: welllll no, it's him contemplating murder to stop someone destroying the universe.
12/21/17, 4:52 PM - Neville Longbottom: Do you think that there is a bounty Hunter / rogue Jedi grandma nun deserter out there with a story to be told?
12/21/17, 4:52 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: moral sludge is where movies are best
12/21/17, 4:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: its moral sludge for the character, yes, but the film as a whole has solid morals
12/21/17, 4:52 PM - Severus Snape: So dark side, light side, no difference?
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Neville Longbottom: I'm wet
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: +1
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Luna Lovegood: def
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Draco Malfoy: as concepts, they are different, but does a character exist purely as light or dark, i would argue, no.
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: severus you're as rigid as the old jedi council...
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Draco Malfoy: which seems to be the point of the OT
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and from my point of view it is the jedi that are evil
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Severus Snape: Lol yeah I am but so is dark side light side
12/21/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: +1
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: :)
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Neville Longbottom: Lol
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not in this trilogy thats like the point
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Severus Snape: I don't need characters to be rigid, I need to know why light turns to dark in them in more than a voice over
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: bc like... duh?
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Neville Longbottom: You guys Star Bros is my favorite Chad ever
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: watch prequels if you need 3 movies to explain that
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Neville Longbottom: Chat
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: they could've had like a 30 min flashback
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: lol chad
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Draco Malfoy: but the movie was already like 3 hours
12/21/17, 4:54 PM - Luna Lovegood: its so lit
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Neville Longbottom: Lol so lit
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: i agree that voiceover like that is kind of cheap
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Luna Lovegood: 4 lit
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: but eh, it worked
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Neville Longbottom: I'm not kidding I look forward to getting out of work to catch up on all these messages everyday
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Severus Snape: Ok, we agree then, didn't for me
12/21/17, 4:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: well we've agreed since the beginning.
12/21/17, 4:56 PM - Neville Longbottom: I really love the dichotomy of the flashback
12/21/17, 4:56 PM - Neville Longbottom: Do you interpret the light side or the dark side of the explanation
12/21/17, 4:56 PM - Severus Snape: Ha you're right. I totally misread that
12/21/17, 4:56 PM - Luna Lovegood: im afraid to log off the chat and drive home
12/21/17, 4:57 PM - Severus Snape: I was like what's a right category
12/21/17, 4:57 PM - Neville Longbottom: Lololol
12/21/17, 4:57 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: opposite of a left catagory
12/21/17, 4:57 PM - Neville Longbottom: severus are you coming here for New Year's
12/21/17, 4:57 PM - Draco Malfoy: omg severus is kylo ren and i am luke, pulling out my lightsaber
12/21/17, 4:58 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: üòÇ
12/21/17, 4:58 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: imagine how annyoing kilo must have a been as a pupil
12/21/17, 4:58 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i would ahve been over his bed every night with a lightsaber
12/21/17, 4:58 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hanging out with Lena Dunham all the time
12/21/17, 4:58 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: "Just give me a goddamn reason...."
12/21/17, 4:58 PM - Draco Malfoy: hahaha
12/21/17, 4:59 PM - Luna Lovegood: HANNAH
12/21/17, 4:59 PM - Severus Snape: Imagine being my teacher at gcds
12/21/17, 5:00 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I do think the jedi council was pretty horrific and deserved to fall
12/21/17, 5:00 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and the new jedi earthy spirituality is much tight-er
12/21/17, 5:00 PM - Neville Longbottom: Agreed
12/21/17, 5:01 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: just like go out to the woods and trip ballz on the force
12/21/17, 5:01 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats the kinda shit I want my jedi getting into
12/21/17, 5:01 PM - Severus Snape: Anyway this is one reason I've been silent in this chat instead of chiming in on every "how cool is..." bc I get the feeling you guys don't want me thread shitting given all the agitation and the lack of reply to my essay
12/21/17, 5:02 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not like sitting in sterile rooms crosslegged and telling peoplle they cant fuck
12/21/17, 5:02 PM - Severus Snape: Lol yeah
12/21/17, 5:02 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: well the essay would take like 10 hours minimum to chew into
12/21/17, 5:02 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: this was a little more managable for a work procrastination argument
12/21/17, 5:04 PM - Luna Lovegood: The essay was difficult to follow given everything I had going on this week. But I plan to reread it over the break.
12/21/17, 5:08 PM - Neville Longbottom: I'm nervous to respond to the essay without taking my time
12/21/17, 5:08 PM - Severus Snape: Like I'd rather you guys enjoy yourselves than raking your fandom over the coals
12/21/17, 5:08 PM - Neville Longbottom: Are you saying you have more than what was in the essay
12/21/17, 5:09 PM - Neville Longbottom: Cuz that would be a lot of gum
12/21/17, 5:09 PM - Severus Snape: A lot more if we went point by point, as in this conversation
12/21/17, 5:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I already had a co-worker who didnt like it then we talked about it a lot and they saw it again and came in today and were like... I was wrong it was really good
12/21/17, 5:09 PM - Neville Longbottom: I definitely do not agree with your low-tier Marvel point
12/21/17, 5:10 PM - Neville Longbottom: Especially considering I'm a fan of most Marvel movies
12/21/17, 5:10 PM - Severus Snape: I better understand /how/ one could like it
12/21/17, 5:10 PM - Luna Lovegood: That won't happen
12/21/17, 5:10 PM - Severus Snape: What won't lol. You won't enjoy yourselves
12/21/17, 5:12 PM - Luna Lovegood: Oh I mean u can say what's on ur mind without worrying
12/21/17, 5:12 PM - Severus Snape: Not everyone wants to be disagreed with all the time
12/21/17, 5:16 PM - Draco Malfoy: Sometimes you need what you don‚Äôt want.
12/21/17, 5:26 PM - Luna Lovegood: Are u talking about yourself or us?
12/21/17, 5:27 PM - Severus Snape: Not me. I generally don't mind. My understanding is it's a spectrum of tolerance
12/21/17, 5:28 PM - Luna Lovegood: Ok. I don't mind in this case. I guess it's case by case for me.
12/21/17, 11:51 PM - Severus Snape: Actually I guess I would see vii and then go to viii di baked I had to lean on someone to get there like a old nun
12/22/17, 12:04 AM - Luna Lovegood: Hop in her wheel barrow
12/22/17, 3:30 AM - Hermione Granger: Happy birthday luna !!!!
12/22/17, 9:04 AM - Luna Lovegood: Thanks brotha!
12/22/17, 9:49 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: the best thing about the star wars universe is they have no inernet
12/22/17, 9:49 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: so jealous
12/22/17, 9:52 AM - Neville Longbottom: lol
12/22/17, 9:53 AM - Neville Longbottom: they have the force net though
12/22/17, 9:53 AM - Neville Longbottom: they don't have time for internet
12/22/17, 9:55 AM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats true
12/22/17, 9:55 AM - Draco Malfoy: Theforce.net
12/22/17, 9:56 AM - Draco Malfoy: One day they‚Äôll be able to get force.net
12/22/17, 9:57 AM - Luna Lovegood: I saw this great article about how star wars is a commentary of the history of digital storage.
12/22/17, 9:58 AM - Luna Lovegood: And it's failures
12/22/17, 9:58 AM - Luna Lovegood: I'll try and find it
12/22/17, 9:58 AM - Draco Malfoy: Like sandisk?
12/22/17, 9:58 AM - Draco Malfoy: Zip drives
12/22/17, 10:17 AM - Luna Lovegood: All that
12/22/17, 1:32 PM - Neville Longbottom: https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5a3cf644e4b025f99e16864d/amp
12/22/17, 1:33 PM - Neville Longbottom: Eat your heart out Kylo ML
12/22/17, 1:37 PM - Hermione Granger: <Media omitted>
12/22/17, 1:37 PM - Hermione Granger: I think this answers the question Leia's space "reincarnation"
12/22/17, 1:37 PM - Hermione Granger: I bet RJ is pretty into hitchhikers
12/22/17, 1:43 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hahaha
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Hermione Granger: Will, this is basically what you said in the car after the movie
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but i think its the opposite you have expel the air
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: or the pressure difference will fuck your lungs
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Hermione Granger: lol
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Hermione Granger: I think your blood would freeze in seconds
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Hermione Granger: Yeah
12/22/17, 1:44 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: naw
12/22/17, 1:45 PM - Hermione Granger: But hitchhikers's reality is closer to SW than our own
12/22/17, 1:45 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: true
12/22/17, 1:45 PM - Hermione Granger: So I'd says that the contextual explanation
12/22/17, 1:45 PM - Hermione Granger: üòâ
12/22/17, 1:46 PM - Hermione Granger: Btw this book is funny as hell. I'd never read it
12/22/17, 1:46 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: oh yeah its good
12/22/17, 1:46 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: lots of yucks
12/22/17, 2:18 PM - Severus Snape: You mean while you enjoy your Jake Skywalker saga?
12/22/17, 2:50 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Mark Hamill don't know shit
12/22/17, 2:50 PM - Severus Snape: Only diwectors matter
12/22/17, 2:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: our obsession with the opinions of actors is bizarre, their job is to emote not to write stories. A few coincidentally can do both. Hamill pitched an evil luke clone to disney so... case and point
12/22/17, 2:54 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: his main argument is also that "jedi never give up" but jedi having given up is literally the foundation of the original trilogy (Obiwan and Yoda)
12/22/17, 2:55 PM - Severus Snape: I barely want to touch how wrong that statement is bc it will distract from what he actually said
12/22/17, 2:56 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Yoda lives alone in a swamp after his failure - thats not giving up?
12/22/17, 3:02 PM - Severus Snape: Laying in wait to participate in the heros journeytm
12/22/17, 3:02 PM - Severus Snape: That boy is their last hope
12/22/17, 3:03 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ew
12/22/17, 3:03 PM - Severus Snape: I mean, I'm not defending it but that's the reality
12/22/17, 3:03 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yoda did not expect luke to come to him
12/22/17, 3:03 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats made up
12/22/17, 3:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: laying in wait in case a space ship that as droids that lukes dad used to own crashes into his planet and delivers a message the yoda doesnt know exists to luke thus sending him toward degobah??
12/22/17, 3:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: no way
12/22/17, 3:04 PM - Severus Snape: He hid from the empire to wait to play his part
12/22/17, 3:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yoda was just like chilling in hiding after he got all the jedi killed
12/22/17, 3:05 PM - Severus Snape: Yo we watched the trilogy together. We know the first hour is the most insane coincidental bullshit in film history. Because force
12/22/17, 3:06 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: right. meaning Yoda was in hiding
12/22/17, 3:06 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not waiting for luke
12/22/17, 3:06 PM - Severus Snape: And Yoda wasn't waiting for Luke in particular
12/22/17, 3:06 PM - Severus Snape: He was biding his time in general
12/22/17, 3:07 PM - Severus Snape: Getting back in touch with the force, waiting to play his part
12/22/17, 3:07 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: like sorry 30 years in swamp smokin swamp weed is him giving up
12/22/17, 3:07 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not some master plan
12/22/17, 3:07 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: he could have found some other potential jedi
12/22/17, 3:08 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: done literally anything
12/22/17, 3:08 PM - Severus Snape: Sounds like the plan of someone who ends up doing nothing
12/22/17, 3:09 PM - Severus Snape: The force would bring the new hope to him when he would be helpful. He had faith
12/22/17, 3:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: nope
12/22/17, 3:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats just a totally bizarre reading of it
12/22/17, 3:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: obi wan doesnt try to train luke either he only did shit when he got the leia message asking him for help
12/22/17, 3:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: they had quit
12/22/17, 3:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: they were old failures
12/22/17, 3:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: SAD!
12/22/17, 3:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I'd love to like live in a swamp for 30 years and be like 'oh yeah this is like me waiting to play my part' but thats not how it works
12/22/17, 3:11 PM - Severus Snape: Obi wan was baby sitting Luke in the final reading although we know ep four doesn't read right on it's own bc it doesn't make sense with the full trilogy
12/22/17, 3:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: right obi wan chose tatoine b/c he wanted to make sure luke didnt get killed or whatever
12/22/17, 3:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but not to like train luke when he got old enough
12/22/17, 3:12 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: no indication that he planned on EVER making contact
12/22/17, 3:12 PM - Severus Snape: It's this instinct you have that you have to actively seek out people to train that I think is misguided. Ppl need to earn the privilege to be trained. That's how greatness is forged
12/22/17, 3:13 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: üôÑ
12/22/17, 3:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: or they had just given up
12/22/17, 3:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: which you cant accept why?
12/22/17, 3:14 PM - Severus Snape: Bc it's not the case
12/22/17, 3:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: except all evidence points to it
12/22/17, 3:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and no evidence points to your theory
12/22/17, 3:14 PM - Severus Snape: They lost the war. But they recognize the new hope
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: they recognize in empire
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not in ANH
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: maybe obi is like yeah come with pretty weird you found these droids
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thats all AFTER
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not a plan from BEFORE
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: before being the 30 years
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: in which they had given up
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: bc they gave up
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Severus Snape: Right bc the new hope hadn't been forged yet. A hundred fly boys a year think they're the answer
12/22/17, 3:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ok so they gave up and then got back in the game when luke came along
12/22/17, 3:16 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Just like Luke gave up and got back in the game when Rey came along
12/22/17, 3:18 PM - Severus Snape: I agree with that (almost like tlj is cliched...). Luke shut himself off from the force and I understand him being mad about that. The difference is that Luke gave up on being a Jedi
12/22/17, 3:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Ok well that‚Äôs not what we were talking about
12/22/17, 3:21 PM - Severus Snape: I'm saying that constant action is not required to signify not giving up
12/22/17, 3:21 PM - Severus Snape: That's what lame Finn's do
12/22/17, 3:21 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I‚Äôm saying that Mark Hamill is stupid bc the two other Jedi in the series gave up
12/22/17, 3:21 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Which you just agreed to
12/22/17, 3:22 PM - Severus Snape: Am interpretation on giving up. I think Luke was the only one that gave up on the force
12/22/17, 3:23 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Eh he lives on like the most sacred force place in existence so idk about that but w/e
12/22/17, 3:24 PM - Severus Snape: I agree with that and I'm not sure why he does
12/22/17, 3:24 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Bc he can‚Äôt fully give up. Just like he can‚Äôt burn the tree üå≥
12/22/17, 3:25 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Also Jedi and force are not the same
12/22/17, 3:25 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: But you use them interchangeably w I don‚Äôt agree w
12/22/17, 3:25 PM - Severus Snape: They aren't the same but one is necessary for the other. You can't be a Jedi without the force
12/22/17, 3:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: But you can use the force without being a Jedi
12/22/17, 3:26 PM - Severus Snape: Correct
12/22/17, 3:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Cuz from my point of view it is the Jedi who are evil.
12/22/17, 3:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: And the force is dope
12/22/17, 3:26 PM - Severus Snape: Necessity doesn't flow both ways
12/22/17, 3:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Return of the Jedi partly sucks bc like Luke was a super fun dude then he became a Jedi and turned out it meant like being boring
12/22/17, 3:27 PM - Severus Snape: Lol
12/22/17, 3:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: This is a Hot take I just invented that I‚Äôm now very into
12/22/17, 3:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: And will be pushing till Winston gets it into a spin article
12/22/17, 3:28 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Return of the boring dudes more like it
12/22/17, 3:28 PM - Severus Snape: Yeah spin is looking for more grazing the surface takes
12/22/17, 3:29 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: sick
12/22/17, 3:29 PM - Severus Snape: Ok I agree with that title
12/22/17, 3:31 PM - Severus Snape: Serious Men have strong convictions and there's a lens to view the force through that says the strength of one's convictions is equivalent to their power
12/22/17, 3:31 PM - Severus Snape: (see The Dark Tower for a proper extension of this exploration)
12/22/17, 3:32 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah youre right the jedi council scenes were so dope bc it was a bunch of serious people saying things flatly to each other
12/22/17, 3:33 PM - Severus Snape: No I mean from original trilogies
12/22/17, 3:34 PM - Severus Snape: Luke needed to be more Serious than Vader to show his conviction was stronger and sew doubt in Vader
12/22/17, 3:35 PM - Severus Snape: But talking about this is not an endorsement of it's dopeness. I'm calling it out is all
12/22/17, 3:36 PM - Severus Snape: And I'm calling out the device that filmmakers use Seriousness to represent strength of conviction
12/22/17, 3:36 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I mean see avatar the last airbender for a monastic character that isnt boring
12/22/17, 3:36 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah like why so serious? totes
12/22/17, 3:37 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: avatar is my star wars you heard it here first üòÇüòà
12/22/17, 3:38 PM - Draco Malfoy: Does Luke say he gave up on the force?
12/22/17, 3:38 PM - Draco Malfoy: Like what makes you say that
12/22/17, 3:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thanks for tagging in J I was out of gas
12/22/17, 3:44 PM - Severus Snape: Rey says he's shut off from the force completely
12/22/17, 3:46 PM - Draco Malfoy: Oh right.  it‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs wrong
12/22/17, 3:47 PM - Severus Snape: He seemed to acknowledge the truth of it by not disagreeing was my read
12/22/17, 3:48 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: his force Chakras are blocked out the ass
12/22/17, 3:48 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: that milk diet fucked him up
12/22/17, 4:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Guys I missed a bunch of this
12/22/17, 4:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: But
12/22/17, 4:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I‚Äôm watching force awakens and it‚Äôs delightful
12/22/17, 4:32 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I still love it
12/22/17, 4:40 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: üôÑ
12/22/17, 4:40 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: agree to disagree
12/22/17, 4:41 PM - Severus Snape: In comparison to EP eight I agree
12/22/17, 4:41 PM - Draco Malfoy: I enjoyed TFA when I watched it recently
12/22/17, 4:41 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: @12039186666 you have no buisness calling 8 derivative while defending 7
12/22/17, 4:41 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: that is just absurd on all levels
12/22/17, 4:42 PM - Severus Snape: Lots of promise
12/22/17, 4:43 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: what does lots of promise mean irt a movie
12/22/17, 4:43 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: a trailer can have promise - a movie has to deliver
12/22/17, 4:48 PM - Severus Snape: It delivers new characters I care(d) about and bigger challenges ahead to surmount and stories I wanted to be told. You know, an unhatched egg in msg, that sort of thing
12/22/17, 4:48 PM - Draco Malfoy: But they were fake JJ Abrams mystery‚Äôs
12/22/17, 4:51 PM - Severus Snape: Yeah I'm a big JJ hater
12/22/17, 4:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Guys he‚Äôs a good director
This movie is fantastic
12/22/17, 4:51 PM - Penelope Clearwater: All y‚Äôall haters
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Severus Snape: It was more than I got from EP eight
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: I agree but his mysterys and conflicts are like phony without follow thru
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Penelope Clearwater: FINN is delightful
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Penelope Clearwater: In ep7
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: So TLS makes TFA bad
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: But TFA on its own is fun
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i thought TLJ made TFA better tbh
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Draco Malfoy: Wellll it‚Äôs mixed.
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Neville Longbottom: What was better
12/22/17, 4:52 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: bc like it sets up something to subvert
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Neville Longbottom: "that's one hell of a pilot"
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Neville Longbottom: Or
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Draco Malfoy: That‚Äôs a fair point
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: without the subversion its just brutally dumb
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Neville Longbottom: "let's go chromedome!"
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Neville Longbottom: Lol
12/22/17, 4:53 PM - Draco Malfoy: I think that‚Äôs true with Rey‚Äôs origin but not Snoke
12/22/17, 4:54 PM - Neville Longbottom: None of us know if jjs plan all along was to make a fan pleasing film only to have the second one smash it
12/22/17, 4:54 PM - Neville Longbottom: He was never going to direct the second one
12/22/17, 4:54 PM - Severus Snape: I agree with that and I was sad I couldn't get more from Rey's bc the plotting surrounding it was a let down. Thought Ren delivering that could've been killer
12/22/17, 4:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: I thought Ren delivering it was good and it felt like a real Star Wars moment to me
12/22/17, 4:55 PM - Draco Malfoy: I mean it wasn‚Äôt cloud city air shaft but it was good
12/22/17, 4:57 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the new characters were good. the worlds were repeats from other star wars to a bizarre degree, the entire structure and plot was a new hope, 5 billion people die and no one bats an eye (characters or audience) when alderan blows up we care b/c of leia bc of holding on her face, we feel that pain in this its like wheeeee, i.e. its disconnected from all stakes and human emotion, solo is so misused its near unwatchable and old harrison ford is just sad to look at, why was harrison ford just like sitting above a planet sadly with the falcon under a tarp. the cg tenticle monster scene was so bad wont even go into details. JJ was so obsessed with mysteries that the first order is like vague as shit (their speech is a joke like... 'we love order!'), the entire mid-section brutally drags, the references to old trilogy are nearly offensive (isn't that the kessel run ship???, like ayfkm), the shot on the dumb middle planet where Poe shoots down like 11 tiefighters is the ultimate videogame-ification of star wars, in the old movies and jedi you feel the hits when ships blow up - its not just like cg bullshit in the background. every scene is shot and paced the same way giving this like horrible weight and deadness to the movie. another death star is not cute its like fucking idiotic. the lightsaber fight is super dope thats the best part.
12/22/17, 4:57 PM - Severus Snape: Yeah that was the moment I was most excited about dragged down by the stuff around it
12/22/17, 4:58 PM - Draco Malfoy: I mean everything you say is right will but it‚Äôs still sort of fun to watch
12/22/17, 4:58 PM - Severus Snape: Yeah these are all not in dispute. I hate jj
12/22/17, 4:59 PM - Severus Snape: I'm in the it's barely watchable (a third time) side which is why I said not to watch beforehand. I am still happy with my theater experience bc it was more than I was expecting
12/22/17, 4:59 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: my point is the new one fixed all of those and more - while its quibble-able its so infinitely more interesting made and structured that anyone liking TFA more I just cant wrap my headaround. the filmmaking is so so so much better in TLJ
12/22/17, 4:59 PM - Severus Snape: It's no rogue one but w/e
12/22/17, 5:00 PM - Severus Snape: The filmmaking didn't deliver for me. Fine, "fix" "problems" with tfa but give me something else interesting to leave with
12/22/17, 5:01 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the entire throne room scene was masterful
12/22/17, 5:01 PM - Severus Snape: Disagree. Only the ren delivery
12/22/17, 5:01 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the treatment of the force was the most exciting since mepire
12/22/17, 5:01 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: empire
12/22/17, 5:03 PM - Severus Snape: In the throne room?
12/22/17, 5:03 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the throneroom scene starts with Ren bringing Ray to Snoke as a prisoner. Shifts to Ren and Rey fighting together as a team. Shifts to Ren taking control of FO. Shifts to Ren revealing what Rey has always feared that she's alone. Shifts to Ren offering allegiance to Rey - and audience (me) actually feeling like "Oh she might take it" which no star wars has made me feel jedi included.
12/22/17, 5:04 PM - Severus Snape: Or in general?
12/22/17, 5:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: in general
12/22/17, 5:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and includes a fucking sick kurosawa battle that has lightsabers being used in ways we never saw before
12/22/17, 5:04 PM - Draco Malfoy: Yessss will yessssss
12/22/17, 5:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: like wtf does TFA have that comes anywhere near that
12/22/17, 5:04 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: it was stunning
12/22/17, 5:05 PM - Severus Snape: Ok, then that I'll put aside bc I don't disagree that the force was ok. The problem with it and more distinctly with the throne room is:
12/22/17, 5:05 PM - Severus Snape: All the stuff you say is absolutely correct from my perspective
12/22/17, 5:05 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: show where snoke dies - close up on his face, lit by blue light. then we dolly back as lightsaber flies in the air, shot ends with reys hand catching it. lemme see JJ do anything that smart
12/22/17, 5:05 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: *shot
12/22/17, 5:06 PM - Severus Snape: But the film that holds up the stuff you're lauding in summary was making my eyes roll constantly
12/22/17, 5:06 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: then see an optometrist
12/22/17, 5:07 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: or see the film again without a nerd beard stick up your ass
12/22/17, 5:07 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: +1
12/22/17, 5:07 PM - Draco Malfoy: Lollolololol
12/22/17, 5:08 PM - Severus Snape: Insult all you want. I know what I watched. A bunch of snarling and fanservice with illogical plotting and writing that swung and missed
12/22/17, 5:09 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: lol saying TLJ is fanservice when all the idiot fans are furious about and when TFA is the definition of fanservice over film
12/22/17, 5:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: TFA was someone eating a fanservice sandwich and shitting it all over the screen
12/22/17, 5:10 PM - Severus Snape: Fanservice was not the highlight of tfa either lol
12/22/17, 5:10 PM - Severus Snape: Saying something didn't work in tlj is not saying it worked in tfa
12/22/17, 5:10 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but its like bizarre insult to make
12/22/17, 5:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: when youre defending TFA
12/22/17, 5:11 PM - Severus Snape: I made it about tfa too to the ends of the Earth
12/22/17, 5:11 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but TFA is inarguably infinitely more guilty of that
12/22/17, 5:12 PM - Severus Snape: Nevertheless the film has more to redeem itself to me
12/22/17, 5:12 PM - Severus Snape: Lol where's Neville
12/22/17, 5:12 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: its like saying none of the planets were inventive in TLJ when TFA literally repeated every planet from the old movies
12/22/17, 5:12 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Uhh watching TFA with delightful glee
12/22/17, 5:13 PM - Severus Snape: Oh you're still watching it. No wonder you're happy
12/22/17, 5:13 PM - Penelope Clearwater: U GUYZ ITS SOGOOD
12/22/17, 5:13 PM - Severus Snape: First half is vastly better than the second and some of my favorite sw
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: it‚Äôs true 2nd half gets worse
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Draco Malfoy: I agree that first half is vastly better
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I can agree
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I third that
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Severus Snape: Yeah I hope you got that haytch Dee w surround swound
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Penelope Clearwater: The hansolo cRrie fisher dialogue is PAINFUL
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Draco Malfoy: cf was better in TLS prob bc better director
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: every solo scene should be cut lol
12/22/17, 5:14 PM - Severus Snape: Bc she was in a coma
12/22/17, 5:15 PM - Severus Snape: Agree except the death
12/22/17, 5:15 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ban harrison ford from coming into every franchise recovery attempt
12/22/17, 5:15 PM - Severus Snape: Which I thought ruled bc of ren
12/22/17, 5:15 PM - Severus Snape: I've had that URL since 2008 will
12/22/17, 5:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the only cool thing TFA did (unless this was rogue one) was show ships pop out of light speed
12/22/17, 5:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and the lightsaber fight oh yeah
12/22/17, 5:17 PM - Severus Snape: From memory the godaful shit of tfa is han except death, hux/fo except with Ren, and that's it? Not sure
12/22/17, 5:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Maz sequence is rough
12/22/17, 5:17 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: cept i like that she wants to fuck chewie
12/22/17, 5:18 PM - Severus Snape: Oh yeah although I liked the trappings and the basement saber vision and the battle on the ruins
12/22/17, 5:18 PM - Neville Longbottom: I wasn't a fan of the idea of starkiller base
12/22/17, 5:18 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and that 'battle' on maz planet is brutally boring
12/22/17, 5:18 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: starkiller base the worst
12/22/17, 5:18 PM - Neville Longbottom: I liked the maz planet scene with x wings coming across the water
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Neville Longbottom: But the scene where poe takes out like 10 tie fighters while Tokyo drifting in such a tight radius bummed me out
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the first order stuff is all horrible generally
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i hate that shot
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Severus Snape: The redeeming parts of the battle are: air to ground support, freezing Rey in place, a couple Snipes, trooper that thinks he's the shit
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: it sums up TFA for me
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: in one shot
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Neville Longbottom: I thought the space battles in TLJ were amazing compared to rogue 1 and TFA
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: But when maz says where‚Äôs my boyfriend
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Neville Longbottom: Trooper that thinks he's the shit was great
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I like that Wookee
12/22/17, 5:19 PM - Neville Longbottom: Han using chewies bowcaster not great at all
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Severus Snape: Lol yeah
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah maz wanting to fuck chewie is great but not worth being on that planet for half an hour
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the bowcaaster thing is BRUTAL
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Uhh disagree
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the worst fan service
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: like... he never used it in the 60 years theyve known eachother
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: ayfkm
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hahaha
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Penelope Clearwater: Maz wanting to fuck chewie is worth everything
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: he was like 'oh whats this never seen this before'
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Neville Longbottom: Agreed
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Severus Snape: https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-four-stars-top-24-dragon-ball-video-games.11214/That was in the junk ship
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i mean jesus christ
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Neville Longbottom: But also, did 3po have a red arm in this one?
12/22/17, 5:20 PM - Severus Snape: Wait ignore that
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Neville Longbottom: Remember how he had a red arm? Did anyone else think that was a dumb grab for fan fic
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Severus Snape: I thought he tried it first in the junk ship
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: the red arm thing could have been cool but it was basically just for like a comic book fan fic tie in
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Neville Longbottom: I think so
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: theres like multiple bow caster jokes in the movie and they are all hell
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: make my skin crawl
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Severus Snape: Like general grevious wheezing which is my favorite SW thing in thirty years lol
12/22/17, 5:21 PM - Neville Longbottom: I did like that fin was a sanitation worker
12/22/17, 5:22 PM - Neville Longbottom: But it made no sense to me that a trooper who went into battle with phasma and kylo Ren would have been sanitation
12/22/17, 5:22 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeah i never really got that
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Severus Snape: He had different jobs over time I assume
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Severus Snape: He was raised in fo
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Neville Longbottom: Yeah that makes sense
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Neville Longbottom: Someone today gave me all this shit about how the bombers were so dumb
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Neville Longbottom: In tlj
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Severus Snape: But I agree that you bring elite fuckers with you if you're ren
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Neville Longbottom: That they were a disgrace to Canon
12/22/17, 5:23 PM - Severus Snape: You mean me?
12/22/17, 5:24 PM - Neville Longbottom: No someone else
12/22/17, 5:24 PM - Neville Longbottom: I agree with G that the bombers battle was amazing
12/22/17, 5:24 PM - Neville Longbottom: All that shit just for one ship was a very nice way to place things back into perspective
12/22/17, 5:25 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i loved the bomber sequence
12/22/17, 5:25 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I did not like "he's on the other line" or "on hold" or whatever the fuck that bit was
12/22/17, 5:25 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but i loved the rest of the sequence
12/22/17, 5:25 PM - Neville Longbottom: TFA really perpetrated this whole Galaxy at war thing that the prequels started... TLJ made the scope more appreciated
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Neville Longbottom: Oh I liked that joke
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Neville Longbottom: It was def very anachronistic
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Neville Longbottom: Or I guess that's not the word but u know what I mean
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: lol it was probably my least fav part of the film I think
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: like not in the universe I get what you mean
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Neville Longbottom: Yeah
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: people feel that way about luke brushing dirt off his shoulder but that didnt bother me
12/22/17, 5:26 PM - Neville Longbottom: It was def dumb
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: But the irons were the same
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but the on hold joke def did
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: And I loved that
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i liked the irons lol
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: The fucking irons
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: They were great
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: But same device no?
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: Similar at least
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: idk i mean you need irons?
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: Super Fantasia
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hahaha they should have made them a diff shape
12/22/17, 5:27 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: imagine JJ having the iron idea... it would be like impossible bc it isnt in a star wars or spielberg movie already
12/22/17, 5:28 PM - Neville Longbottom: I mean I guess you need irons like you need a broom
12/22/17, 5:28 PM - Neville Longbottom: Is Droid labor not as cheap as having kids around?
12/22/17, 5:28 PM - Neville Longbottom: Where do they draw that line
12/22/17, 5:28 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: labor issues have always been so confusing to me in star wars universe
12/22/17, 5:28 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hahahaha
12/22/17, 5:29 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: half the time droids are treated like how we treat cars... we have affection for them but like... theyre machines. half the time droids are like humanized...
12/22/17, 5:30 PM - Neville Longbottom: Like where are the dwarf dudes from empire on canto bight
12/22/17, 5:30 PM - Severus Snape: What is the irons stuff?
12/22/17, 5:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: jeremy irons had a cameo
12/22/17, 5:30 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: as an iron
12/22/17, 5:31 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: but he didnt do a good job so they arrested him
12/22/17, 5:31 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: and put him in irons
12/22/17, 5:31 PM - Severus Snape: Makes sense
12/22/17, 5:31 PM - Severus Snape: The Mission needed a squequel
12/22/17, 5:32 PM - Neville Longbottom: Man in the Jeremy irons mask
12/22/17, 5:32 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: lolol
12/22/17, 5:33 PM - Neville Longbottom: Ugh I was content for like 3 days on waiting two years for the next star wars
12/22/17, 5:33 PM - Neville Longbottom: All this awesome chatting has me so pumped for it
12/22/17, 5:33 PM - Neville Longbottom: And the best part is
12/22/17, 5:33 PM - Neville Longbottom: Im not fucking theorizing about what happens
12/22/17, 5:33 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: +100
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Neville Longbottom: I'm just talking about what happened and have genuinely no fucking clue where it's going
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yeeesss
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: thank fucking god
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: let the content farmers find something else to ruin
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Neville Longbottom: Avengers would've felt this way if they didn't have that stupid thanos scene at the end
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Neville Longbottom: But I guess that's what avengers is
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Neville Longbottom: Comic book zone
12/22/17, 5:34 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: movies being about creating theories for the next movie is the worst trend
12/22/17, 5:35 PM - Neville Longbottom: Yeah it sucks thanks Kevin Feige you suck
12/22/17, 5:35 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: at least we will be able to ALL agree on the next star wars movie
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: bc Star Wars Story: Han Solo is going to blow so hard
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Severus Snape: Hard to say imo
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Neville Longbottom: Hahahah
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: omg
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: mikes gunna love it

12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Penelope Clearwater: I‚Äôm prob gonna love t
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Neville Longbottom: Guys Ron Howard. The director of Apollo Thirteen
12/22/17, 5:36 PM - Severus Snape: Bc I'm sure the original directors would have made something to watch, but the director switch is almost more intriguing to me
12/22/17, 5:37 PM - Neville Longbottom: I might agree with severus rn
12/22/17, 5:37 PM - Neville Longbottom: I want to agree
12/22/17, 5:37 PM - Severus Snape: Like maybe Ron has enough respect for the other directors to rescue their best stuff?
12/22/17, 5:37 PM - Severus Snape: But Mark me down for hating the fact the movie exists in general
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: I think Ron already said he's reshooting much more than he though
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: t
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Severus Snape: It's intriguing is all
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: it happened with ant man and that was still a mediocre junk pile
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: not that i saw it lol
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Neville Longbottom: Did you guys like 21 jump street
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Severus Snape: Bc it could become unwatchable or it could become like three brains worth good?
12/22/17, 5:38 PM - Neville Longbottom: Cuz I didn't
12/22/17, 5:39 PM - Severus Snape: Ant man was not mediocre
12/22/17, 5:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: if you say apollo 13 is good - then howard hasnt made a good movie in over 20 years
12/22/17, 5:39 PM - Severus Snape: It was horrifying
12/22/17, 5:39 PM - Neville Longbottom: Totes
12/22/17, 5:39 PM - Neville Longbottom: Most Marvel is mediocre junk pile
12/22/17, 5:39 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: yes

12/22/17, 5:40 PM - Neville Longbottom: Except iron fist
12/22/17, 5:40 PM - Neville Longbottom: Oh and inhumans
12/22/17, 5:40 PM - Severus Snape: luna and I watched it high and we were like well this could keep being terrible or I guess we could give each other lobotomies and this will get a lot better
12/22/17, 5:40 PM - Neville Longbottom: Not touching inhumans with a 10 ft pole
12/22/17, 5:40 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Black Panther will be my last Marvel
12/22/17, 5:41 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: i mean probably not but thats my goal
12/22/17, 5:41 PM - Severus Snape: Famous not last words
12/22/17, 5:41 PM - Neville Longbottom: I'm psyched for infinity war
12/22/17, 5:41 PM - Neville Longbottom: Civil war was so bad
12/22/17, 5:41 PM - Severus Snape: I'd be up for transitioning to us doing big at home premieres. Bc I might be out of paying

12/22/17, 9:23 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: He cuts them off before the music swells can really take full effect
12/22/17, 9:23 PM - Minerva McGonnagall: Otherwise great film üëç
12/22/17, 9:23 PM - Draco Malfoy: I noticed that. I assumed it‚Äôs because the movie needed to be cut for time
