10/24/20, 21:52 - Highcomm: Forwarding as received:

*A Message from #EndSARS Protesters*

Good morning,

In 2 weeks Nigerian youth created an administration that worked. 

• We raised funds. We fed thousands of people, people were actually returning food saying "i have eaten, pass it to people at the back".

• We provided security for ourselves. 

• We set up a legal team that bailed protesters out of police dungeons.

• We created a health care system that worked.
 
• We created a call center, basically our own 911 that you could call for ANYTHING protest based.

• We provided basic amenities. We made sleeping on the protest grounds more comfortable than what many Nigerians had at home. 

And we did it together. Everybody just stood up one morning and said "i can provide this". And they did. 

*What did the government do in return?*

• First they tried to look for who to bribe. They kept asking "who is your leader"? We responded: "We have no leader", "Jimoh/Chijioke is our leader, raise him from the grave and talk to him". They didnt have anyone to bribe or intimidate. 

• Next, they tried to sow seeds of discord and confusion, saying "Igbos are this, Muslims are that, CoVID19 is spreading ... ". We responded "Okay. We will tolerate eachother now and your bullets have killed more people than CoVID19"

• Finally, they weaponised the poverty they created. They sent thugs in the North, thugs in the west, thugs in the south. They paid 1500 naira. Do you know how much poverty of the mind and soul, a person has to be in, to accept N1500 to maim people?

• They sent these people to disrupt our peaceful protests, to loot, to cause mayhem so that they could have an excuse to give the world.

• And finally, they sent in the Nigerian Military. The people that are sworn to defend Nigerians. Guns blazing, they came. Shooting at peaceful people. They shot at people who sat on the floor, singing the national anthem and raising flags.

• They took away the dead bodies to erase evidence. They took away the cameras and burnt the ones the could not disconnect. 

• But we had our phones. The protests that started on our phones were broadcasted using our phones. The evidence is public. It can never be erased.

Now we know this poverty is not a mistake. The high illiteracy in this country is not a mistake. We know that the government has to keep people suffering because they need poor and uneducated people to carry out their orders.

_While we tend to our wounds, the fight is not over. We will restrategise and come back. We had hope for 2 weeks. People died to keep the hope alive. So we will come back._
_We will interact with the uneducated and poor ones in our communities. We will educate them. We will help those we can. We will let them see how this is also their fight. We will let them understand that they are helping their oppressors. And then, We will come back. We are sad. We are upset, We are angry. But we have not given up._

11/14/20, 15:41 - Oye: Good day everyone,
Please robbery on  Sangotedo to Ajah axis is now rampant. Please take the following caution
1. Don't leave very early  to work if possible.
Vehicles were rob early morning on Monday and Tuesday at Shoprite junction, they mounted road block. 
At least wait till 6.30am

2. Don't close late and dont come home late to Ajah area and Sangotedo-Lakowe road if possible. 

Since Wednesday last week there has been serious robbery and killing. At Ajah, General Paint, Sangotedo, Awoyaya. A female vendor was killed at Alpha bus stop  this week Wednesday night by 9pm. The killers were on bike, they collected her bag and belongings including money then shot her.
Just yesterday too robbers intercept a bullion van along addo road Ajah, close to Blenco, so many gun shots  leaving dead a delivery bike man 

3. If you work late at night pls  watch out for thieves on bikes.

4. Don't withdraw money from ATM in a lonely place either day or night.

5. Don't walk alone at night and early morning hours.

6. Watch before you enter bus at night and day time especially early hours of the days.

7. And Finally, be prayerful, pray for protection everyday. 

Please kindly forward to friends and love ones.

This is so important for people staying around those places. They are so deadly now as all the police stations there have been burnt down during #ENDSARS protest so no police.

Since you were a scholarship recipient, would it be too much for me to ask you to share the link below with a woman you care about who you think could benefit from the scholarship? Also, could I ask you to consider sharing with any groups or organizations whose members you believe would benefit?

This scholarship is identical to the one you received, meaning it is 100% free. The good news is that the quality is improving as I am about to add a workbook and many other features. Below, I include a description of the course and the scholarship so you could copy-paste it.

Course title: How to Start Building Your Wealth Investing in the Stock Market.
Course promise: This proven, step-by-step system will transform you from feeling frustrated, intimidated, and overwhelmed about investing to being a confident investor who is in control of your financial future.

Scholarship details: The Women Building Wealth global scholarship initiative aims to help women to learn how to start building their wealth investing in the stock market. With these skills, they can better manage the wealth they are generating through their work and businesses. Winners of the scholarship get free access to the How to Start Building Your Wealth Investing in the Stock Market online course, a US$200 value. Besides, they get access to the private Women Building Wealth Facebook community. The deadline to apply is midnight Monday, November 30th, 2020.

Website: This link provides more info about the scholarship as well as a button to click to apply http://valuationmasterclass.com/women-building-wealth/

Thanks so much for your help.

11/23/20, 18:07 - Oye: Bible says and a man will leave his father and mother and clip to his wife". My interpretation!
A man is a male that take responsibility for his decision. He does not need reporting matters about him. He does not need reliance but can manage all around him. 
I observe that it is the woman that live her parent and clip to his man. Then i realise that the leaving of his parent means honpuring your wife. Kake her appreciate and not regret leaving her family. Treat her as ur mother and father. You lived with them and respect them. Do so to your wife because she is one u choose to live with henceforth. 
Clip with ur wife implies become one with her always. Regardless of all, treat her the way you will treat urself. You know her before taking her to complete u. Therefore, you must live in understanding with her. She is a woman and not a man like you. She enjoy process unlike u who enjoy action. Live with her with understanding.
Above all don't live in assumption but in communication with her. Don't relate with her base on past action but live with her on plane group. Love her always unconditional. Never imagine punishing.
I appreciate women but pls live in submission with ur husband.
May God bless ur homes.

12/10/20, 08:34 - +234 705 599 6409: *WOMEN, DON'T TRY TO KNOW A MAN WAYS JUST CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR HIM IN ALL HIS JOURNEY IN LIFE*

A woman in the city went one morning to her husband's office to report him to his boss. She told her husband's boss how her husband usually squandered his N60,000 salary and only gave her N30,000 for upkeep.

After her narration, the boss told her to come back on the last day of the month.

On the set day, she arrived as planned. The boss called the husband and they all sat down in the boss' office.

The boss started,' Mr. Mike, you wife reported to me some days ago that you squander your salary outside and only give the family N30,000 for upkeep. So right now, I'm going to personally hand over your salaries to her from today henceforth.'

'How much is you transportation to work daily?', the boss asked.
'N900 sir', Mr. Mike replied.
The boss handed over N19,800 to Mr. Mike. 'That should take you for 22 days'.

'Do you take breakfast at home?', the boss continued.
'No sir, I leave home very early to beat traffic jam'.
'How much do you spend on breakfast and lunch daily?'
'N500 sir',replied Mr. Mike.
The boss handed over N11,000 to Mr. Mike.

'Who pays the children's school fees', the boss asked facing Mrs. Mike.
'He does', she replied pointing at Mr. Mike.
'How much is the school fees and how many kids have you?'
'N30,000 per term for the two kids we have?'
'In other words, you save N10,000 monthly for each term's school fees right?'
'Yes sir', replied Mr. Mike.
Once again, the boss handed N10,000 to him.

'Who pays the rent and how much is it?'
'I do sir. The rent is N36,000 per annum.' Mr. Mike replied.
'That's N3,000 monthly right?', the boss added as he handed over N3,000 to Mr. Mike.

'I don't want to ask about clothings, electricity bills,etc as I know both of you might be handling that', the boss said as he handed over N16,200 to Mrs. Mike.
'What's this for sir', Mrs. Mike asked surprised.
'Money for upkeep', the boss replied her.
'But it wouldn't take us anywhere', she exclaimed.
'So why don't you appreciate the N30, 000 your husband sacrifices for you monthly', the boss asked.
The woman hugged her husband tightly and the rest is history.

*Moral:*
A lot of women don't know what their husbands sacrifice to put food on the table. Most times, they go hungry. Sometimes, they swallow their pride and engage in menial and debasing jobs just so their families can eat. A lot of times, they can't even buy good clothes to wear rather they sacrifice so that their wives and kids can get one.

A man might not tell you what he goes through to get you the cash he gives to you as telling you might make you start underrating his person but to tell you the truth, men go through a lot and need to be appreciated.

If you gained something
Always tell ur husband
Thank you & love him more.
