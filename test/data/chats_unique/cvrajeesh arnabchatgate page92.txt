Order taking effect, BARC India will continue to release viewership ratings on
every Thursday to subscribers.
However given the changes taking place on ground the viewership numbers will be
volatile and unpredictable. So BARC India will temporarily stop publishing
rievership numbers to the press and public domain (Website, App, Heacs-up, Alpha
Club , Kids report, etc) for the transition period till the situation on ground
settles down. This will be effective from Week 6 onwards.
During this period, BARC India will also not be able to answer questions on
changes in vievership trends during this transition period.
Also attached is the BARC Advisory perpairing to the New Tariff order.
