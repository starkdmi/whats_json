Now we need to calculate a number between *0* and *d-1* (both included), lets call it *r*, and then *return a+r*

*How to do that? 😬*
We can represent any number between 0 and d-1 by using *floor(log2(n-1))+1* bits (you can verify this😁), let us call this value *n*
*Initialize r=0*
Now, simply generate *n* bits of *r* using the given function.
By doing this we will get a random number in range *[0,(2^n)-1]*, generated uniformly
*Exception:*
If d is not a perfect power of 2 (i.e. d<2^n) we might end up getting r>=d, in this case  we  need to repeat this procedure while we don't get *r<d*

_Answered by Rishabh Jain, Founder at Coding Club India_

Google Summer of Code is program to promote open-source development. It is organized by Google every summer since last decade. It runs for 12 weeks from mid May to Mid August. Students contribute to open-source repositories and get paid by Google in return. It’s a great way to spend summer vacation.

♦ *Eligibility* 
You must be a student. That’s it. No other criteria. Age, Country, Qualification - no criteria. If you have a student ID card, you are eligible.

Turns Out You have to be 18 years old for participating in GSOC !

♦ *Application Procedure*
This is not a program where you fill up a form and get selected.

♦ *First, the interested open-source* organizations apply. They are shortlisted by Google. The students will code for these organizations and the organization has to mentor the student. in GSoC 2014, around 190 organizations were selected including the big organizations like Mozilla, KDE, etc. The list of organizations selected is announced around mid-February.

♦ *Every Organization had an Idea’s Page* or a Wiki Page in which they publish the list of possible projects. Some even have a to-do list. Students can browse through organizations and check out their projects. If they like any project, they can contact the organization or the mentor itself via the organization’s Mailing List. One can come up with his/her own project, which is even better. Generally, each organization wants the student to show some background in the area of the project (fast learning abilities + keen interest is fine too), and familiarity with tools like version control system (GitHub is the most popular). One has to demonstrate his/her skills which can be achieved by fixing some bugs. Generally there will be a list of known bugs/issues in a repository and some of them are really simple to fix. One can even try to find, report and then fix a new bug. One has to install that particular repository on their system, get comfortable with it and understand (at least the basics) what’s going on. Past Open-Source Experience is a big plus although not necessary.

♦ *Student application period is* between 1st to 3rd week of March. Once the student has demonstrated his/her abilities, they have to apply via Melange. They have to write a project proposal. This proposal should outline the project objectives, technical/implementation details, timeline and end deliveries. One can ask the concerned mentor to review his/her proposal before submitting. One student can submit up to 5 project proposals. However, at max only 1 project is assigned to each student.

_Answered by Bhawna Jain, Went to ICPC Asia Region, Kolkata-Kanpur Site_

Yes Of course.

To make this happen here are some recommendations :

👉 *Practice and work on Algorithms :* To become cool, you need at least 2-3 hours a day to solve problems a day. On various sites aggregators of tasks such as Codeforces, Spoj, Codechef, Leetcode, Topcoder and many many others.

👉 *Participate, Participate, Participate :* Participate in all online competitions.

👉 *Reminds the rule of 10 thousand hours :* There is an opinion that people become professionals not because of talent, but in fact investing man-hours in their occupation. However, there are also unique persons, like Gennady Korotkevich (google, read). The best in any area become almost impossible. However, there is a chance.

👉 *Speed Matters :* Very important is the speed of writing the algorithm, and easy memorability. Some techniques for its good modification, if the task requires its minor modification. Reading the leader code also does not hurt, to understand how elegant to write.
Happy Programming !

11/03/2020, 13:58 - +91 97181 67527: 👑 *Must read:*  How do programmers approach problem solving and coding on Online Coding Contests ?

_Answered by Rishabh Jain, Founder at Coding Club India_

To solve a problem, just follow these simple steps :

♦ *Read the Question:* Not difficult at all. The problems generally contain long stories about some people and what not. You don’t need these to solve the problem. Read the input/output formats and constraints very carefully. If the output format doesn’t match with the required output format, it would give a Wrong Answer. Constraints are really very important part of the problem as it sometimes hints to the expected time complexity of the solution.

♦ *Understand the Problem:* Understand what is asked and what is given in problem. Verify your understanding with the sample test cases and the explanation given.

♦ *Make an Algorithm:* This is the most important part of solving. Use your problem solving abilities to think of an efficient algorithm for the problem satisfying the required time constraint. If the problem requires a standard algorithm that you know, you’re good to move on to the next step. Generally, this wouldn’t be the case in a contest. First try to think of a naive approach and see if it fits the time constraint. If not, see for some optimisation. If it still does not work, try to reduce the problem into simpler solvable problems. More and more practice will help you figure out how to solve more complex problems.

♦ *Finding Naive Solution :* Also called brute-force method. Simply do what the problem states. For instance if you need to find the sum of first n natural numbers, the naive method would be to do this :
for(int i = 1;i<=;n;i++){
 sum += i;
}

♦ *Finding Optimal Solution :* Also called brute-force method. Simply do what the problem states. For instance if you need to find the sum of first n natural numbers, the naive method would be to do this :
sum = (n*(n+1))/2;

♦ *Code(or write) the Solution:* Before writing the solution, think of the data structures required, what data needs to be arranged in maps/arrays/vectors etc. Choosing right data structures according to the need of the solution helps in solving the problem much easily. If you think carefully before coding you wouldn’t get confused while writing the code. As you practice more and more, you’ll get better at thinking faster.

If you get stuck on a problem during a contest, it’s best to try your best before searching on the Internet or asking someone for the solution. Don’t give up if you get stuck. At times, competitive programming can be quite demotivating; but only persistence will help you learn and be a better coder. A lot of effort goes into improving your speed and accuracy in competitive programming.

_Credits : Rishabh Jain, Instructor at Coding Mafia_


👉 *How can we calculate A^B mod C quickly for any B ?*

Lets say 7 ^ 13 mod 19
13 = 1101 in binary
13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0
13 = 8 + 4 + 1 
i.e
7^13 = 7^8 * 7^4 * 7^1
7^1 , 7^2, 7^4, 7^8 which can be calculated in just 4 steps just by keep squaring .

👉 And hence multiply 7^8 * 7^4 * 7^1 to calculate 7^13.

*Implementation :*

*long long int ans = 1;*
*while( n>0 ){*
	
	_// multiply only if_ 
	_// bit was set_
	_//13->6->3->1_
	_//1 0 1 1_
	*if(n%2==1){*
		*ans = ans*base % mod;*
	*}*

	_// squaring up base_
	_//13->6->3->1_
	_//1 2 4 8_
	*base = base*base % mod;*

	_//13->6->3->1_
	*n=n/2;*	
*}*

*cout << ans;*

*Time complexity :* O(log N)

Keep Coding !

14/03/2020, 17:03 - +91 97181 67527: ✍ *My Review : for AI Mafia course* 
Python + Machine Learning A-Z is a great introduction to python and ML. A big tour through a lot of algorithms making the student more familiar with libraries and other packages. The theoretical explanation is elementary, so are the practical examples. ML- A to Z by AI Mafia is a right course for a beginner to get the motivation to dive deep in ML. From here you can choose where to go and, therefore, master it! In short, very introductory, no-brainer, wide coverage. A good way to start.​

_Credits: Anonymous at GFG_

🎯 *Round 1:*  The first round was an online coding + aptitude + debugging test.

1⃣ There were 2 coding questions – is path possible in 2 D matrix and the other one was very similar to a linear search in a 2D matrix.
70 minutes were provided for these questions.

2⃣ The debugging questions were also fairly easy, simple replacement of || operator by && types.

3⃣ The aptitude questions were also simple and ample time was provided for them.
Candidates had to solve both coding questions, all debugging questions and perform well in the aptitude section also to qualify for the next round.

🎯 *Round 2:* The second round was an interview round. My interviewer asked me 4 questions and also asked me to code all of them after discussing the solution. Below is the list of questions asked:

1⃣ The first question was to Find the Next Greater Element, optimized solution was expected.

2⃣ The second question was to find the mirror tree of a given binary tree.

3⃣ The third question was  similar to the first question, the interviewer thought of the question on the spot but if someone knew the answer to the first question then this question would not be a problem.

4⃣ The last question was to find the min cost of joining n rods.
There were no more rounds conducted for the candidates, amazon selected the candidates on the basis of these 2 rounds.

_Credits: Anonymous at GFG_

*I was recently interviewed* for an internship position at Amazon and had to go through a total of 3 rounds i.e. one online followed by two telephonic rounds.

🎯 *Online Round*
As usual the online round had two coding questions and 20 MCQs. This was a pretty easy round and it’s duration was 90 minutes. The round consisted of questions from various domains like Algorithm, Data Structure, Operating System and Aptitude.

🎯 *First Telephonic Round*
I had just three days to prepare for this round and truly speaking, it was my first experience of appearing in any such interview.

This round lasted for almost 60 minutes. It began with my general introduction followed by a brief discussion on my projects. After this, the interviewer asked me these questions:

1⃣ *Question:*
I had just three days to prepare for this round and truly speaking, it was my first experience of appearing in any such interview.

This round lasted for almost 60 minutes. It began with my general introduction followed by a brief discussion on my projects. After this, the interviewer asked me four questions.

2⃣ *Question:*
Given two trees check if they are mirror images of each other or not.
This was a straight forward question and it took me less than 10 minutes to code it.

3⃣ *Question:*
What is semaphore and what do you mean by a deadlock.

*After two days I got a call* from the HR informing me I have been selected for the next round. Now it was the time for the last and the decisive round.

🎯 *Second Telephonic Round* 
This time I had to face three technical questions and one general question on Amazon : 

1⃣ *Question :*
Given a BST, replace each node with the sum of the values of all the nodes that are greater than that node. Only constraint being that I was not allowed to use any global or static variable.
Although I panicked a bit and made few mistakes, I got through.

2⃣ *Question :*
Given an array of numbers find the maximum count of duplets and triplets such that there sum is a multiple of three.
Number that has appeared once can’t be included anywhere else.
I solved this question using a property of modulus.

3⃣ *Question :*  
Given the stock prices of 10 days find the best possible buy sell pair.
For this question I started with a O(N2) solution but then finally managed to reduce it to O(N) solution with constant space complexity.

15/03/2020, 16:56 - +91 99688 28927: 🎯 *Microsoft Interview Experience*
_Credits : Anonymous_

🎯 *Round 1:* 
(Multiple choice questions)

*1⃣ Question:*
Intersection of two linked list.

*2⃣ Question:* 
There is a 2 d array. 0 signifies water and 1 signifies land. an island is connected 0s(in all 8 direction) and no 0 should be on the outer edge of two array. You have to count the bumber of such possible array.

You have to solve both coding question to enter in 2nd round

In round 2 interviewer were very cool and supporting. try to shake hand while entering and ask every detail of problem.

🎯 *Round 2:*

*1⃣ Question:*
Explain yourself.

*2⃣ Question:* 
A backtrack problem on sudoku.
write full code on paper in any language. write failure case of your code.

*3⃣ Question:*
Discussion on projects.
i had done a project on big data on frequent itemset.they were really interested in each and every detail of big data paradigm.
4. Your strength and weakness and extra curricular interests,

🎯 *Round 3:*

*1⃣ Question:*
There is a 3 million character string. u have to print the count of occurrence of each node.
do not jump on to the question. wait for him to complete. i gave count sort pf O(n) solution but he was focusing on more optimized one.

*2⃣ Question:* 
Again he jump to my big data project. he gave me a real life scenario and asked to design it.
you are giving the information of about 10,000 sites about their users and the product they had bought. you are a consultant. give a big data solution to find out the places where users had bought the jewellery in large amount. also give the name and details of users who had bought jewellery in large amount.

He was quite impressed by my design. we discuss the design for about 30 minutes. then instantaneously they told me that i am selected for 3rd round.

In my case, I actively started...

🎯 *Round 4:* (HR round)
HR was very cool
1. tell me about yourself.
2. why Miscrosoft.
3. tell any 4 of your favorite product of Miscrosoft
4. tell 2 good and 2 bad points of Microsoft.
5. Why you opt for your college.
he was trying to check my planning skills to compare 2 entities.
6. Why computer science.
7. Tell any 1 social problem that bothers you the most.
8. Suggest 3 solution to above problem as a technical guy.
9. what is big data
10. what will you do if your colleague is not working
11. what if you are not agreed with your senior

My tips is to stay cool and enjoy the interview. carefully tell your weakness. Don’t worry to ask questions from interviewer. Take proper use of the time. Big data helps me a lot in every round.focus on designing problems along with data structure.
