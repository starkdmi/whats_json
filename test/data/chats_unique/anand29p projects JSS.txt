सम्मान कार्यक्रम के व्यवस्थित आयोजन का दायित्व श्रीराम बाजपेई स्काउट्स एवं गाइड्स एसोसिएशन को मिला

 सभी सदस्य संस्थाओं को शिक्षण प्रशिक्षण एवं अन्य गतिविधियों को ऑनलाइन आयोजन करने का दिया निर्देश 

वर्ल्ड फेडरेशन ऑफ इंडिपेंडेंट स्काउट्स के एशिया रीजन द्वारा कोरोना काल में विशिष्ट योगदान करने वाले व्यक्तियों स्काउट और गाइड कार्यक्रम से जुड़े हुए व्यक्तियों को तथा संस्थाओं को अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर के पदक, सम्मान, प्रशस्ति पत्र आदि से सम्मानित करेगी। यह जानकारी देते हुए फेडरेशन के एशिया चेयरमैन डॉ प्रवीण कुमार ने बताया कि कोरोना काल में राहत एवं अन्य गतिविधियों में विशिष्ट योगदान देने वाले व्यक्तियों एवं संस्थाओं को तो सम्मानित किया ही जाएगा इसके साथ साथ फेडरेशन द्वारा स्काउटिंग गाइडिंग कार्यक्रम के विकास, विस्तार, प्रचार, प्रसार आदि में विभिन्न प्रकार से सहयोग करने वाले व्यक्तियों एवं संस्थाओं को भी सम्मानित किया जाएगा।

 उन्होंने बताया कि फेडरेशन के एशिया रीजन द्वारा विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में सम्मान देने का उद्देश्य अधिकतम लोगों को मानवता एवं जीवो के कल्याण के लिए निस्वार्थ भाव से अपनी अपनी क्षमता अनुसार अधिक से अधिक सहयोग करने तथा योगदान प्रधान करने के लिए प्रेरित करना है। वैसे तो संस्था प्रतिवर्ष स्काउटिंग कार्यक्रम के जनक लार्ड बेडेन पावेल की जयंती पर सीमित क्षेत्र में ही एवं स्काउटिंग गार्डिंग कार्यक्रम से जुड़े हुए व्यक्तियों को सम्मानित करती रही है लेकिन इस बार विशिष्ट परिस्थितियों को ध्यान में रखते हुए तथा स्काउटिंग गार्डिंग कार्यक्रम की लोकप्रियता को बढ़ाने के उद्देश्य को लेकर सम्मान कार्यक्रम के क्षेत्र का विस्तार करने का निर्णय लिया है।

उन्होंने बताया कि वर्ल्ड फेडरेशन ऑफ इंडिपेंडेंट स्काउट के एशिया रीजन द्वारा इस वर्ष स्काउटिंग गाइडिंग के विकास, शिक्षा, सामुदायिक सेवा, कोरोना वारियर, सामाजिक न्याय, युवा विकास, खेलकूद, सांप्रदायिक सौहार्द, विश्व बंधुत्व, महिला सशक्तिकरण, वृक्षारोपण, रोजगार सृजन, कोरोना काल में अपने देश की सरकार को सहयोग करने, कोरोना राहत कार्य में लगी हुई संस्थाओं तथा कोरोना वारियर्स की सहायता करने, मानव अधिकारों का संरक्षण, सामाजिक कुरीतियों के विरुद्ध जन जागरण अभियान संचालित करने, कला, साहित्य, आर्थिक विकास में योगदान करने, मनोरंजन, स्काउटिंग-गाइडिंग कार्यक्रम को बढ़ाने के उद्देश्य से आर्थिक सहायता, एकल स्काउट एकल गाइड के रूप में प्रशिक्षण, स्काउट गाइड लीडरशिप आदि क्षेत्रों में इस बार सम्मान प्रदान किया जाएगा।

डॉ प्रवीण कुमार ने बताया कि कोरोना महामारी को देखते हुए इस बार फेडरेशन द्वारा ऑनलाइन पंजीकरण कराने का निर्णय लिया गया है। इसके साथ साथ सम्मान समारोह को भी ऑनलाइन आयोजित करने का निर्णय लिया गया है। इसके पीछे कारण बताते हुए उन्होंने कहा कि सम्मान समारोह में विभिन्न देशों से पात्र व्यक्तियों का आना सुरक्षित महसूस नहीं किया जा रहा है। इसके अलावा सीमित संख्या में पात्र व्यक्तियों को संक्षिप्त कार्यक्रम में सम्मानित किया जाएगा तथा अधिकांश पात्र व्यक्तियों को उनके सम्मान पत्र उचित माध्यम से उनके द्वारा दिए गए ग्रह पते पर भेजे जाएंगे।

इस संबंध में आगे जानकारी देते हुए फेडरेशन के चेयरमैन ने बताया कि पात्र व्यक्तियों का चयन वर्ल्ड फेडरेशन ऑफ इंडिपेंडेंट स्काउंट्स के एशिया रीजन की अवार्ड कमेटी द्वारा किया जाता है। पंजीकरण फार्म में ही आवश्यक सूचनाएं योगदान साक्ष्य के रूप में प्रमाण ऑडियो वीडियो पीपीटी अखबारों में प्रकाशन आदि आवश्यक चीजें मांगी गई है।

फेडरेशन के एशिया चेयरमैन ने बताया कि इस वर्ष सम्मान कार्यक्रम की व्यवस्था करने का दायित्व फेडरेशन की सदस्य संस्था श्रीराम बाजपेई स्काउट्स एवं गाइड्स एसोसिएशन को दिया गया है। इस संबंध में आगे जानकारी देते हुए डॉ प्रवीण कुमार ने बताया कि विभिन्न सम्मान पदक प्रशस्ति पत्र आदि हेतु पंजीकरण 15 अक्टूबर 2020 से प्रारंभ होंगे।

डॉ प्रवीण कुमार ने आगे जानकारी देते हुए बताया कि कोरोना महामारी के काल में प्रत्यक्ष शिक्षण प्रशिक्षण कार्यक्रम तथा बड़ी संख्या में एकत्रीकरण जैसे आयोजनों पर रोक लगाई गई है। एशिया क्षेत्र के सभी सदस्य संस्थाओं को जहां तक संभव हो सके ऑनलाइन शिक्षण प्रशिक्षण एवं अन्य गतिविधियों को नियमित रूप से संचालित करने हेतु निर्देशित किया गया है।

1/26/21, 8:19 AM - +91 82873 71091: फ़ना होने की इज़ाजत ली नहीं जाती,
ये वतन की मोहब्बत है, पूछकर की नहीं जाती
इस दिन के लिए वीरों ने अपना खून बहाया है,
झूम उठो देशवासियों गणतंत्र दिवस फिर आया है! 

संस्कार, संस्कृति और शान मिले,
ऐसे हिन्दू, मुस्लिम और हिंदुस्तान मिले,
रहे हम सब यूंही मिल-जुल कर,
मंदिर में अल्लाह और मस्जिद में भगवान मिले।

*गणतंत्र दिवस की हम सभी को हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं।*
