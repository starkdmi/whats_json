Everyone loves a humorous *_PR battle_* between 2 brands play out on Twitter in the form of clever roasts or memes. Not only does this contribute to the online brand integrity but also makes a brand more likeable. These factors in turn influence sales. 

So, are you ready to get into the shoes of the brand for a change?
Your job as a team is to come up with a series of roasts against other brands in your allocated domain and the team with the wittiest comebacks wins the PR battle!
