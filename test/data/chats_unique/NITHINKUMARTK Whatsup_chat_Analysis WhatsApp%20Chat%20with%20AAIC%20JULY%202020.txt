25/04/22, 7:08 pm - +91 99455 64234: How are your labels? Integers or one-hot encoded?
25/04/22, 7:08 pm - +91 70422 37611: its integers going through generators
25/04/22, 7:09 pm - +91 79880 17750: Try using categorical cross entropy instead
25/04/22, 7:10 pm - +91 70422 37611: not working..
25/04/22, 7:10 pm - +91 99455 64234: Your loss function is correct, but there is some error in its computation
25/04/22, 7:11 pm - +91 99455 64234: Could you print some five outputs from y_true?
25/04/22, 7:12 pm - +91 70422 37611: y_true ?
u mean target classes ?
25/04/22, 7:12 pm - +91 99455 64234: Yes

25/04/22, 7:21 pm - +91 99455 64234: Shouldn't you use softmax instead of sigmoid? Because you need probable output class across all the classes?

25/04/22, 7:31 pm - +91 70422 37611: both did worked in my previous model
so i continued to use Sigmoid

ok letme try with softmax too.
25/04/22, 7:31 pm - +91 70422 37611: thnks..

25/04/22, 8:21 pm - +91 99455 64234: After the model is trained, you can use model.predict on a single datapoint and do argmax of output to know the class
25/04/22, 8:27 pm - +91 70422 37611: so, in the manner models arch is Ok...
that means, flatten & then dense layer to throw single dimension output is not needed ??
