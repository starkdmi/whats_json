5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro
5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: Chutiyap sa video dekha
5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: Blind bhakts wala
5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: I want to share it with a strong status
5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: How is this
5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: If someone opposes the construction of a mandir "we will throw them to Pakistan".
Maybe if they build a school there, we'll have smarter voters in the future. It's sad to see how the Divide and Conquer strategy always succeeds to tear the nation apart. Only way to move forward  is to contribute to the growth of the nation and not the prosperity of one's religion.
5/17/19, 10:23 AM - Jenit Jain: I don't share often isliye puch raha hu üòÇ
5/17/19, 10:56 AM - Kaustubh Singh: Good enough
5/17/19, 10:57 AM - Kaustubh Singh: See what comes to your mind in first go usually turns out to be a view that you can defend
5/17/19, 10:57 AM - Kaustubh Singh: And also say something on this Pakistan thing
5/17/19, 10:57 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro iska itna pata nahi
5/17/19, 10:57 AM - Jenit Jain: But basically they just want to divide themselves
5/17/19, 10:59 AM - Kaustubh Singh: Likh, Mera dharm Itna kamzor nahi ki Ek mandir nahi banane se toot jaaye. 
Aur hote kaun hai Ye log bolne wale Pakistan Bhej denge, ye desh jitna Unka hai utna humara bhi
5/17/19, 11:03 AM - Jenit Jain: Sirf those add kiya
5/17/19, 11:03 AM - Jenit Jain: If someone opposes the construction of a mandir "we will throw them to Pakistan".
Fanatics think they have the power to throw Indian citizens out of the country. There are over 2 million temples in India, maybe if they build a school there, we'll have smarter voters in the future. It's sad to see how the Divide and Conquer strategy always succeeds to tear the nation apart. Only way to move forward  is to contribute to the growth of the nation and not the prosperity of one's religion
5/17/19, 11:24 AM - Jenit Jain: Already got a hater üòÇüòÇüòÇ

5/17/19, 11:34 AM - Kaustubh Singh: No she won't if you have a healthy discussion
5/17/19, 11:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Also, it was never a Hindi country right? It was only secular na?
5/17/19, 11:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes yes obviously
5/17/19, 11:35 AM - Kaustubh Singh: I mean we are a Hindu country but mostly that is why we can live in a secular country
5/17/19, 11:35 AM - Kaustubh Singh: Honestly, Hinduism is very tolerant

5/17/19, 1:01 PM - Kaustubh Singh: Aunty this generalization, this mentality, ki 'we allowed',  'we let them' ,this is what is going to drive us in the ground. 
There might be those who don't adhere to some laws, but by generalizing this we are no better then. 
We talk about how bad they are, what about the Muslims who died protecting this country and your freedom and mine. People like ashfaqullah khan, khan Abdul gaffar khan, Lt Umar Fayaz, etc. What about people like them. Arree the whole air defense system which which we are so proud of was given by one Muslim man. Dr. Kalam. 

And Pakistan was created and people were given a choice, if you want to leave you can or you can stay. It won't change a thing. Partition didn't happen with the mentality that Pakistan will be a Muslim nation and India will be a Hindu nation. No. Pakistan was supposed to be Muslim nation but India was supposed to a land where everyone can stay and prosper equally. 

We can generalize, we can fight, we can debate all we want. But the truth is, till the time we keep fighting on issues like Hindu and Muslim, we can never be a developed nation. We'll always be a developing one. 

And aunty as far as west Bengal is concerned, I can't argue with that. That place is too far gone for now. 

And any Muslim in right mind, doesn't support the wrongs of that religion. 
This stereotype is what is going to kill us.

The idea was of BHARAT.  A land of proud people who live here in harmony with each other. We've been fed so much propoganda by the politicians and media that we've forgotten the goods.
5/17/19, 1:01 PM - Kaustubh Singh: Read it

5/17/19, 1:04 PM - Kaustubh Singh: So let's not genralize
5/17/19, 1:04 PM - Kaustubh Singh: Everyone takes pride in calling ustaad bismillah khan our own. Why?
5/17/19, 1:07 PM - Kaustubh Singh: We take pride in their achievements, but just because of some miscreants we don't shy away from generalizing and stereotyping them. Is that really the India you talk about?
