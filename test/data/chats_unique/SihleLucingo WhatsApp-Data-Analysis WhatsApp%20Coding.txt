*Group 1*
Can I (Keoikantse) get the complete LMS tomorrow (16th of August 2022 at 10am)

Should be *completly* done, please share login credentials for administrator and credentials for 2 students as well. 

Please attach the link and credentials to a discord channel named "Final Projects"

*Group 2*
The client is sending Maleka emails requesting to see her final project (Uhlanga Books)
Please have the designs ready tomorrow by 10:00 and be ready for a zoom presentation with her and me by 10:30. You will not present code, but the overall flow of your project. If you dont knock ber socks off, we'll have a problem.

Before you show the actual site, you'll do a PowerPoint presentation. If you dont have it right now, I advise you start working on it now. Go online and search how to make a ppt presentation for a website. All the best.

Many thanks

All the best, I might not stick around for presentations. Have to go back to Khayelitsha
20/09/2022, 17:38 - Mother Of Many 🌸: May I please bore you one last time today.

Here's what will help you be a good developer/designer/tester/software administrator or any positioning tech


*1. Positive Attitude*

A great programmer is ambitious and eager to do their best. They step up when there’s a deadline to hit, take feedback *without getting defensive*, and take care of their company’s product.


* 2. Good Communication Skills*

Programming is a linguistic skill, so being a good communicator is directly related to being a good developer. In fact, great offshore developers usually speak more than one language, as well as having great English. You need to be able to ask the right questions, understand concepts without needing a written specification document, and turn problems into theories and theories into coherent solutions.

*3. Time and Task Management*

Having a good work ethic and being punctual is important, but beyond that, you also need to be able to predict how long things will take you and to “manage up”, setting expectations with your boss or clients instead of leaving them to manage you.


*4. Quick Learning*
Great developers are committed to their own development. They’re *self-learners* who can pick up new technologies independently and aren’t afraid to ask when they don’t know the answer.


*5. Technical Experience*

Great developers have experience that’s both deep and broad, and have a good grasp of best practices like agile development, task management tools like Jira and Trello, version control, and working in different environments. *START UTILIZING TRELLO, PLEASE*


*6. A Good Team Player*

Good developers aren’t just committed to their own development, they also care about *helping other developers improve*. They’re willing to teach, answer questions, and write documentation that favours teammates both in their business and in the wider developer community.


*7. End-User Focus*

A great programmer doesn’t just do what they’re asked – they think about the end user’s wants and needs and work to solve problems, create high value, and cut features that don’t create value.


Wrapping up, there are no solo-riders in this industry. Know how to work with other people (set differences aside and achieve the end goal of your project). Know how to function as a team (this is where you teach yourself how to communicate with your fellow colleagues/trainees ^or I could get Mr Zantsi for a masterclass^)


Lastly, recognize and acknowledge people that are put in higher ranks than yours. No matter how shabby you think their technical skills are, they're put there for a reason. This goes for both CodeTelligence & Younglings mentors/facilitators. Do not in any way get tempted to weigh their intellectual capacity, or respond to them in a demeaning manner. 

Other than that, I'm happy with the progress thus far. I'll make a form available tomorrow for you to lodge complaints should there be any. 
~Have a nice evening~
