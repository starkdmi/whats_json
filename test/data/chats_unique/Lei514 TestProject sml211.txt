9/3/19, 10:00 AM - Lei W: Thank you for being part of the best dream that I can remember.  I am back in the office and still in a daze.  Will send you link to album in email later, but here's to connect with # (702 807 7004 in case WhatsApp doesn't auto show)
9/3/19, 10:02 AM - Lei W: Btw really glad that Manzo/galaxy cat/Jonathan rode back with me.  His way of life in Nunavut is so incredible
9/3/19, 10:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you for writing. Have a beautiful day. You will be in my thoughts.
9/3/19, 7:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I just landed in Toronto and during my flight I wrote of our last few days so that we can refer back to it if our memories fade...
9/3/19, 7:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I was a butterfly.
Your eyes drawn by the sparkle of my wings, 
shining like precious stones under the desert sun.
I saw your kindness,
It made me flutter closer.

Your intelligence and humor had me rest my wings,
and together we chased the rising sun.
I listened to your spectacular stories of amazing adventures,
and returned in the dark to seek shelter from the cold and share my soul.
Your caring touch made my body tremble with delight,
Safe and secure in the heat of your strong embrace.

Hand in hand we explored extraordinary art, uplifting music, inspiring people.
We lost ourselves, let reality melt away, and found each other in patterns of colours and energetic beats.

The devine sunrise
was neither the end nor start of our day.
We stood over skeletons of The Burning Man,
his ashes keeping us warm,
as we marveled at the glorious orange temple.
The sun ascended through a metallic eye, breathtaking and surreal,
and we paused, lived the moment, and thanked the universe for its perfection.

Our last sunset the most accomplished painter could not replicate,
For my vision was tinted with love,
Of nature, of humanity, of life, of your soul.
When we had to bid farewell,
stardust of glowing ember fell from twilight.
And the beautiful lights of glistening stars guided our way home.
9/3/19, 11:41 PM - Lei W: That is beautiful, truly brought a giant smile to my face.  My memory is unlikely to fade having experienced what I did, but to read it in your voice makes it even more special.  Glad you had a safe flight, hope you are truly relaxed in the comfort of your own home.  Sweet dreams Sangmi...

9/5/19, 12:23 PM - Lei W: You do know some accomplished people!  I just looked at his linked in and was impressed. Hope you slept well.   I must have been amped up at BM didn't need much sleep and now I have been sleeping 9 hrs last few days.
9/5/19, 12:24 PM - Lei W: Surprised I lost only 1 lb at BM.  3 more from my goal of 140. Started at 155 3 months ago.
9/5/19, 2:17 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It is surprising - you really did not eat much! I wish I could get 9 hrs of sleep. My little guy was coughing next to me all night. I do know many ppl as accomplished as Jeff or even more so, but he is a good friend because he is so humble and caring. He is an amazing mentor, has won multiple teaching awards, and is so selfless in a competitive research world (you have no idea how many economists with huge egos I know). The first panel I was on with him, I was so intimidated and was going to literally start by apologizing to the attendees that they had to listen to me after his brilliant and funny talk. When I told him this he made me feel at ease, confident, and appreciated, and set me up in his talk to show how much he valued my expertise. He is an avid photographer himself and at least every few days we exchange photos of sunrises/ sunsets and of interesting architecture. We can also talk about health data/ economics for hours. You guys would get along...though physically I think he is only into beach volleyball and hiking as far as I know.
9/5/19, 2:22 PM - Lei W: He's at UC Davis right? Used to be in Toronto?  Yes on the health and economic side I don't talk to many nowadays after I left Akido Labs.  Sleep - it's my #1 pleasure in life though I wish I didn't enjoy it so much.
9/5/19, 2:24 PM - Lei W: Being a single parent is so difficult every time I visit my son and ex and take over for a few days I appreciate it more and glad at the same time I don't have to do it day in and day out right now.
9/5/19, 2:28 PM - Lei W: My photo Instagram account only has people photos right now it's Instagram.com/airy photos if I didn't tell you already.  Sadly maintenance of online stuff is time consuming so it's sparse like other things

9/6/19, 9:04 AM - Lei W: But living off the ca coast on an island?! Didn't know that was a dream of yours too wow!
9/6/19, 9:05 AM - Lei W: Good morning BTW.  Happy Friday hope you slept well

9/6/19, 11:25 AM - Lei W: What a beautiful work space!
9/6/19, 11:25 AM - Lei W: I am also WFH as most in my company does on Fridays
9/6/19, 11:26 AM - Sang Mi Lee: It also has Plato, Jung, lots of poetry, physics books, The Alchemist, art books etc...I still like holding books.
9/6/19, 11:27 AM - Sang Mi Lee: My friends tell me this is their fav photo of mine when I show them BM photos and I told them it is taken by a boy who made me believe in love again 😘

9/8/19, 11:46 PM - Lei W: Also can pick you up/drop you off from airport etc if necessary also depending on how much time you have and your work requirements.  Will work out logistics when it gets closer

9/9/19, 5:03 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Example of what I speak about to patients/ patient groups to educate (which I had talked to you about). I also do speak in public on more nerdy topics though...
9/9/19, 10:51 AM - Lei W: This is the age of the Nerd.  Tip of the hat to all the Jocks.

9/9/19, 2:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you. I am so grateful that you exist and that our paths crossed.
9/9/19, 3:02 PM - Lei W: Luck is a cruel mistress but also weirdly irrelevant for some things and some people.  But I totally understand and agree with what you said.
9/9/19, 6:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Isn't luck a fickle mistress and fate a cruel one? I just read your email and it made me laugh...we are all foolish at times, aren't we, and what's important is that we have enough self awareness to recognize when we have been one? I am feeling the early wake up and 2 hr time difference...so will have to attempt my quantitative reasoning course quiz tomorrow AM when my jetlag wakes me up at 4-5am. Before I go to bed though I wanted to, just randomly, share my favourite authors with you...Dostoevsky and Hesse probably...actually fantasy I used to and still have is that I could make time stop so that I could spend years just reading in a beautiful old library then I could restart time and live out my life. Books I read every year is Le Petit Prince and another that I read bits and pieces often is The Alchemist. In fact, there is a line from The Alchemist that came to me that makes me think of you: "So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."
9/9/19, 6:56 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh and I like Orwell, Dickens, Oscar Wilde and science fiction...and lots of poets. Good night.
9/9/19, 10:32 PM - Lei W: As I typed that luck is a cruel mistress I realized that it was fate in common sayings, but that luck and fate are reversed in their character for me.  Will tell you why when we next talk.
9/9/19, 10:35 PM - Lei W: As to books, I so miss the days when I had time aplenty and was able to finish every book of my 7 big bookshelves.  Sci fi and fantasy mostly but with sprinkles of others.  The alchemist is one I always wanted to get to but never did.  Me I will read it to feel more context in that line you quoted.  Had a busy day but lots of productive meetings so this message is reaching you late hopefully while you are in the midst of those sweet dreams...
9/9/19, 10:36 PM - Lei W: And my fantasy is close to but only slightly different than yours..
9/9/19, 10:44 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/10/19, 8:38 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Good morning, happy to hear you had a productive day. I would love to talk to you again...free tomorrow (11th) night to chat a little? And how is weight loss/ training going? I went to gym at the hotel this morning which was first time at a gym in a few weeks and noticed I had lost some weight...
9/10/19, 11:41 AM - Lei W: Yes tomorrow night works. Let me know approx what time if you will call and not sure if your schedule yet, or pick one and I will call.
9/10/19, 11:44 AM - Lei W: Weight loss is almost done.. Hit one of my goals a month early. Training also exceeded expectations getting back to a rhythm. 1st world problems : pants I bought 4 months ago needs to be tailored. 😕
9/10/19, 11:46 AM - Lei W: Momentarily the smallest sizes in normal stores fit me waist wise but now I am back to limited selection or alterations for modt

9/10/19, 1:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am free any time at or after 10:15pm EDT tomorrow!
9/10/19, 1:40 PM - Lei W: Well I forgot you already told me! OK I'll call you at 1015 tomorrow night. Since you will be back to Toronto by then yes?
9/10/19, 1:41 PM - Lei W: Good luck in the rest of your trip  in your getting things done

9/10/19, 5:41 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So fantastic! Ir certainly does not look light so very interesting to know that it is...did they tell you what material it is? I was living in Seoul during 1988 summer Olympics. I think that was when I fell in love with watching it...I don't really watch TV and watch very little sports now but do enjoy World cup, Olympics, and whenever Toronto team gets into playoffs.

9/10/19, 5:47 PM - Lei W: Torch is mainly aluminum.  A lot of thought actually went into its design and materials.  Torch relay will start 4 months before the official lighting of the Olympics.
9/10/19, 5:48 PM - Lei W: It only weighs 1kg without fuel.
9/10/19, 5:49 PM - Lei W: Nunavut.. I got all the info and totally want to get up there too.  But too early to plan yet.

9/10/19, 8:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My brother asked me for a painting. He said something about Trappist-1 planets. How serendipitous, I thought, as I had been reading Carlo Rovelli’s Reality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity. As I was painting, it occurred to me, just how remarkable it is that we can see potentially habitable planets 40 light years away. We know that the space – void – we stare into is not truly empty but comprised of astonishingly tiny particles. We’ve made incredible advances in medicine since I graduated pharmacy in 2003. Yet, how is it that we have seen such little progress in our ability to love freely – so much discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation – or be true to one’s self (e.g., gender identity). Why do women and minorities still have to fight for rights and why do we still hurt each other because of differences in beliefs (e.g., religious)? I was explaining to Jamie the other day the technologically different world I grew up in – and with sadness in my head thought about how little the society has evolved in other ways. When we were in Antigua, Jamie was describing a group of girls playing and called black girls “really tanned girls” and white girls “not tanned girls”…
9/10/19, 11:02 PM - Lei W: Love the painting.  It's because I have little skill in the arts that I appreciate those who do.  As to planet discovery and telescope advancement that's such an exciting field! But the mind itself has few answers unfortunately.  Just matters of perception and many closed minds.  Take joy in that society is changing rapidly with information sharing, we just have to be patient as it isn't overnight. Good night 🌹💘💤
9/10/19, 11:13 PM - Lei W: Felt strong at the gym today.  Excited to see gains rest of the year, crossing my fingers for injury avoidance.  Thought I'd share one of my best moments from 20 years ago from the first time I was in Yosemite
9/10/19, 11:13 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 3:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you! Lovely photo to wake up to (early flight again...straight from airport to office/meeting when I get to Toronto).
9/11/19, 4:22 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am sure you have everything under control but if there is any way for me to support/ cheerlead from afar, let me know. At least I will also wish for your health and injury avoidance and cross my fingers for you.
9/11/19, 11:22 AM - Lei W: Your wishes for my well being are exactly what I would like the most.  (apparent) high risk activities and how friends and family relate are a complex thing.  I am nowhere near real athletes like them but I participate enough to feel similarly.  (by injury avoidance I mean from over training for my age not from unexpected events)
9/11/19, 11:24 AM - Lei W: Free solo the movie as I talked about shows one perspective of the above.  BTW here's the other photo I showed you already, this one in Joshua Tree and not as dramatic but I tried to do the same pose.
9/11/19, 11:25 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 12:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I understood what you meant about injury avoidance. I do not believe in worrying about unforeseen circumstances. And I would trust your decision making re: risk taking and the need to follow your passion. So I hope you would know that my absolute encouragement of "high risk" activities is not due to my lack of sincerely caring for your health and safety. Ttyl.
9/11/19, 2:59 PM - Lei W: 👍👍👍 We are on the same wavelength!

9/14/19, 12:24 AM - Lei W: Did I tell you I was doing a quick corporate portrait session for the office?  Haven't done one in a long time but it was decent.

9/15/19, 3:59 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have overcome much of my insecurities, though certainly still feel like not a good enough mom too often. Here is another not so great but rhyming poem I wrote that shows that.
9/15/19, 3:59 PM - Sang Mi Lee: As I ponder the meaning of being a good mother...here's a simple poem for Jamie (6) and Mia (3)

I held you tightly in my arms,
Exhausted and exhilarated.
Could I shelter you from all harms?
I asked myself till exasperated.

You kicked, fussed, and cried,
I panicked, kissed you and worried;
You smiled and to my call replied,
I felt strength I knew not I carried.

From the first “no” to the last tantrum,
Did I do the right thing? I never was sure.
With each fever and aches to overcome,
Did I do enough? Ailments had no cure.

You are still very little, still so unaware
Of the intolerance and the ignorance.
Have we taught you well, to share,
To give, love, celebrate your difference?

I cuddle you at night, softly singing,
Sometimes terribly afraid I will fail you.
But I promised from the beginning
I’ll try…to be the best person you ever knew.

9/17/19, 7:57 PM - Lei W: So cute! And your kids too and the fun enhanced graphics
9/17/19, 8:00 PM - Lei W: I don't remember but looking at my photo the star trails are about 1/10 the length compared to the distance from the center (north star).  So 2 Pi * 10 means 1/62.8 of a whole circle which would be 24 hours.  That's like 23 minutes.  But I probably did some round number like 20 minutes.  Photos like that just needs adjustable photo settings and a tripod
9/17/19, 8:03 PM - Lei W: Multi color because some stars are blueish and others are reddish hard to tell unless compared.  The only obvious example is Allbireo which looks great through a small telescope
9/17/19, 8:04 PM - Lei W: (if you Google it you will see and I'll show you in a telescope if you like)
9/17/19, 8:04 PM - Lei W: Albireo one l stupid auto correct
9/18/19, 11:06 AM - Lei W: When should I call tonight? Can call same time as Sunday (11pm et) unless earlier is better for you
9/18/19, 11:39 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 10:30 ET would be great if that's ok with you.
9/18/19, 11:57 AM - Lei W: Confirmed and signed in triplicate and faxed to somewhere to be ignored by recipient

9/19/19, 1:53 PM - Lei W: I wish my views were half as good.... But then again I choose the apartment with the bigger space instead of the water view so only myself to blame
9/19/19, 1:55 PM - Lei W: Big news at work today.  Good for me but pretty shocking for everyone.  This month God is on a rampage
9/19/19, 3:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Excellent!
9/19/19, 3:51 PM - Lei W: Well... It sounds good but I'm not sure exactly if it's good for me.  Time will tell.  Will tell you next call.
9/19/19, 7:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/19/19, 8:05 PM - Lei W: No, rather the exposed brick likes you... Very very much.
9/19/19, 8:06 PM - Lei W: Wow what a photo.  And why is she talking to me?!  I must be dreaming
9/19/19, 8:59 PM - Sang Mi Lee: A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality. (John Lennon)
9/19/19, 9:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Who was quoting Yoko Ono
9/20/19, 3:25 AM - Lei W: Love that quote
9/20/19, 3:27 AM - Lei W: Can't stop looking at your photo

9/20/19, 3:32 PM - Lei W: Like your hair. Have fun at the wedding! Try not to get married...
9/20/19, 3:33 PM - Lei W: When should I call you next? Pick a day and let me know
9/20/19, 3:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Can we talk on Sunday night? 10:15? Hope you had a beautiful Friday. 😘
9/20/19, 3:52 PM - Lei W: Busy day, but too many errands.  It is a beautiful California day outside though.  Hope your day is great literally and otherwise!  Will call Sunday
9/20/19, 3:54 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/20/19, 3:55 PM - Lei W: Yes that's the Playa sunrise
9/20/19, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 😍 Thanks for this photo.
9/20/19, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: From the reading at the wedding
9/20/19, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: The key to love is giving..
Without thought of return
But with the hope of just a simple smile
And by giving in but never giving up.
The key to love is respect..
Realising that you are two separate people, with different ideas
That you don’t belong to each other
That you belong with each other, and share a mutual bond.
9/20/19, 8:29 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/20/19, 8:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Awwwwww...love you
9/20/19, 8:52 PM - Lei W: Well yes kittens no can defend... 😘❤️

9/20/19, 8:56 PM - Sang Mi Lee: The woman I am dancing with, a classmate, is a leading transplant nephrologist in the world.
9/20/19, 8:57 PM - Lei W: Accomplished people who also knows to let loose, the world needs more of you.

9/23/19, 9:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/24/19, 1:27 AM - Lei W: No bra and ready for bed... You know that I like the more natural you the most right? Makes me feel closer to you.
9/24/19, 1:30 AM - Lei W: Unfortunately I can't comment on your piano concert quality any more than I am able to judge fine wine.  All I know is that I enjoyed it and got to see you in motion, dexterous fingers especially.  😍😘🌹

9/24/19, 11:38 AM - Lei W: Woot!! Excited for October even more now.  I will know my own schedule a bit more clearly in the next few days, in terms of who and when I need to be in LA which determines location and sun or mon stay for me.
9/24/19, 11:55 AM - Lei W: BTW did I tell you today yet that you are an amazing person? Just wanted to say that. Have a good Tuesday Ms. Amazing

9/25/19, 2:55 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/25/19, 7:55 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Btw you can call me tonight or tomorrow night if you are free.
9/25/19, 2:25 PM - Lei W: Tonight is tough as I have deadline for something til 1130 ET.  But tomorrow should be doable I will let you know
9/25/19, 2:26 PM - Lei W: It feels like I am all of a sudden running 2 companies... 😑
9/25/19, 2:33 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You do have two jobs at the moment with significant demands! If you have time tomorrow we can chat but if you want to decompress from working so hard towards this deadline and need to catch up on other stuff like training I can talk to you over the weekend. Totally fine. I will write you if I feel like telling you something :)
9/25/19, 4:26 PM - Lei W: 2 jobs would be hard but doable I was used to 80 hr weeks for long periods.  It's more like no one knows what is going on and few people are delivering on their tasks and I have to manage and organize their stuff plus do my own job.
9/25/19, 4:26 PM - Lei W: Tomorrow is fine I don't have commitments after 11 ET but will keep you posted
9/25/19, 8:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I hope everything went well today. As frustrating as your situation sounds maybe there is a good reason why you are in a situation where you need to show and grow your leadership and managerial skills. Xo
9/25/19, 8:42 PM - Lei W: I always need to grow those skill sets and others.  But you can't change people overnight and sometimes there are higher priorities that I have to sacrifice instead.  Also I want to be a 20 yr old white male billionaire with movie star looks and Olympic athlete genetics or I will throw a fit!!!
9/25/19, 8:44 PM - Lei W: OK as the world is the way it is, can also learn to abandon all desires and be peaceful like the Dalai lama.  He has some good books I haven't gotten to. 🙏
9/26/19, 1:59 AM - Lei W: Call you tomorrow (today) Thursday at 11 or 1115?
9/26/19, 5:39 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes. That works. Dalai Lama..."pain is inevitable but suffering is optional..."
9/27/19, 8:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: *caveat-I have had a few Scotch with good friends/ some of my staff...I can't express just how incredible my life is and, separately, how wonderful it has been to get to know you...no matter what happens, thank you so very much for helping me grow and embrace being vulnerable...I feel so alive:)
9/28/19, 12:08 AM - Lei W: Happy that you are happy.  💑 Growing together is one of life's best pleasures...
9/28/19, 12:09 AM - Lei W: Finally organized some photos, here's an album from Tokyo.  https://photos.app.goo.gl/7jZ6kfAptzMVccEK9
9/28/19, 12:11 AM - Lei W: I have captions for most photos but it's a pain to click info button to show it.  Google needs to improve their UI
9/28/19, 4:25 AM - Sang Mi Lee: It is actually pretty user friendly on the phone to see captions. You just slide photo up and slide through.
9/28/19, 4:25 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you for sharing! Really enjoyed them, especially with the captions.
9/28/19, 12:32 PM - Lei W: Yes Google​ emphasized the mobile UI because most are on their phones I am too old school. 😁
9/28/19, 12:33 PM - Lei W: Having fun Saturday?

9/28/19, 1:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Awww❤
9/28/19, 1:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just came back from Mia's friend's 5 yr old unicorn/ disco bday party! Will be meeting up with my Sacramento friend who is here guest lecturing at U of T to talk to him about using pharmacoeconomic evaluation and ICUR to price drugs, to help me advise Canadian agency called PMPRB with their regulatory changes (something I need to prioritize a bit over the next month).
9/28/19, 4:13 PM - Lei W: 😊 Like the work talk too.  Pmprb sounds like they should be under your jurisdiction too. Give Sang Mi Lee all the power. 👍😁
9/28/19, 6:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: He wants me to give career talk including how to balance life, family, career etc. to his 8 female PhD students in public health at UC Davis. He said I could do video Skype and I said I am hoping to have a reason to come to SF more and if that is the case I will come lecture in person.
9/28/19, 6:13 PM - Lei W: Wow nice. Let's hope that works out.
9/28/19, 6:14 PM - Lei W: Sounds like a lecture you are very suited in giving
9/29/19, 5:11 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/29/19, 5:13 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Let me know if you are free to chat tonight, I am good at 10 ET tonight or tomorrow night.
9/29/19, 10:53 AM - Lei W: 10et tonight!
9/29/19, 9:20 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hopefully you read this when you are done everything important for the day...I love Rodin, and a yr and a half ago went to Philadelphia just to see the Rodin gallery there...here is one of my fav pieces there and a poem I wrote
9/29/19, 9:21 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/29/19, 9:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Also lame as far as poems go...but sometimes when you are thinking about sex your brain is leas than optimally functional
9/29/19, 9:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/30/19, 2:36 AM - Lei W: Just read the whole article of Rodins life and wow he lived an artist 's artists life with such passion controversy tragedy and fame.  One of many things that stood out was his prolific output.
9/30/19, 2:38 AM - Lei W: Regarding Camille, I find it interesting that you relate to her so much.  I don't know how much you expect life to imitate art in our case.
9/30/19, 2:40 AM - Lei W: As to sex affecting better thinking, isn't that more of a problem for men? We are going to have to do something about it...
9/30/19, 2:52 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
9/30/19, 3:14 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Poem was written in a situation where I was both Rodin and Camille in a way. I identify with both...but more with Rodin than Camille.
9/30/19, 3:14 AM - Sang Mi Lee: ❤
9/30/19, 3:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Back in the day when I was still confusing love with a lot of other things
9/30/19, 4:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: There is actually a beautiful Rodin garden at Stanford that I would like to get to some day.
9/30/19, 4:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/30/19, 4:28 PM - Lei W: That looks very healthy.  Nice work
9/30/19, 8:42 PM - Sang Mi Lee: More about me as I go to bed...I told you my tattoo on my ribs is middle line of a haiku a dear friend wrote for me. She wrote it only months before her diagnosis of cancer, and she only had 4 months after diagnosis before she left us. Whole haiku was:
Dear kind, gentle soul
From shadow into the light
Pure luminescence.

I strive to be the person she saw, at times even have a little conversation in my head with her. She passed 1.5 yrs ago and when I was in Hermosa beach and woke up 2 hrs before Marty, I folded cranes. I had everyone who knew and loves her fold cranes while she was fighting and getting chemo...and gave her this a few wks before she passed
9/30/19, 8:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/30/19, 8:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
9/30/19, 8:51 PM - Lei W: Beautiful Haiku.  Cranes such a great gesture.  But you are blinding me with yourself.  To see that makes the 4 day wait turn into 96 hrs and 15 minutes. 😪 But worth the wait.
9/30/19, 8:52 PM - Lei W: I'm going to take a cool shower now...
9/30/19, 9:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh sun I am going to http://www.oaklandchopbar.com at 11
9/30/19, 9:06 PM - Lei W: Ha that is 3 blocks from where I live and work
9/30/19, 9:11 PM - Lei W: If it's a nice place let me know and I will check it out with friends later as well
10/1/19, 7:32 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So I was supposed to be figuring out what I say on panels tomorrow morning (https://www.marketaccesscanada.ca/program/) but instead had dinner and beautiful conversation with my staff/ amazing friend (I recruited her to join us last yr, I went to Egypt with her many yrs ago) since though we work together we had not really talked for a few months! So now I will just go to bed and wing it tomorrow...you have time to talk tomorrow evening? I should be home by 10:30.
10/1/19, 10:47 PM - Lei W: Yes can call you at 1030 or you can msg me if you are home earlier
10/1/19, 10:49 PM - Lei W: And I'm sure you will wing it as well as many others prepped

10/3/19, 12:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Saw this just before I went up to speak on my last panel for the conference :) - see you soon!
10/4/19, 11:23 AM - Lei W: Less than 10 hrs!  Don't need to reply just messaging you to wish you a productive day that gets as much as you prefer to get done before the flight.
10/4/19, 11:25 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
10/4/19, 11:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: One of my fav food ever, seared scallops! So...I had a ridiculously productive day, which started at 4am. And not only did I get everything I had to get done before leaving the office completed by 1pm AND also had the last meeting of the day cancelled...so I came to the airport early and I just got my ticket changed to AC 753 flight departing here at 16:55. No need to change your schedule but I will certainly be there to meet you as soon as you get to the airport. (I now arrive closer to when you initially thought I would arrive.)
10/4/19, 11:44 AM - Lei W: Well then I need to hurry and complete my things 2 hrs earlier! Gonna "Git 'Er Done" as us rednecks say
10/4/19, 11:45 AM - Lei W: Text me when you are on board
10/4/19, 11:57 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Will do but I 100% meant you should not change your schedule so no need to rush. I have a lot of work I have for the long flights and can keep myself busy on the other side.
10/4/19, 11:58 AM - Lei W: (lalalala I can't hear you) while using you as motivation to be more efficient
10/4/19, 2:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: On the runway.
10/4/19, 2:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: There were some delays so plane just took off...going airplane mode...will message when I land ❣
10/4/19, 7:52 PM - Lei W: It seems you about 30 min delayed I'll be in the terminal somewhere and I'll tell you where once I get there
10/4/19, 7:57 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just landed but 10 min wait to get a gate.
10/4/19, 8:01 PM - Lei W: 10 minutes myself to get to the airport
10/4/19, 8:21 PM - Lei W: I am at exit g
10/4/19, 8:22 PM - Lei W: Which is where you will come out I think
10/4/19, 8:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Garage g?
10/4/19, 8:29 PM - Lei W: Are you put3? No I am in the terminal
10/4/19, 8:29 PM - Lei W: Put3 out

I am just leaving the plane. My brother is picking me up. Have to have a video conference with my MBA team en route home. Got through my work email in the airport and managed to do some work and readings on the plane! Sending you love xo

10/8/19, 10:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I should watch it while doing squats :)
10/8/19, 10:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/8/19, 10:17 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I have meetings from 1-3pm on Mon at Amgen, will schedule something with my friend when we next talk and figure out our schedule.
10/8/19, 2:05 PM - Lei W: I had forgotten to talk about hotels with you over the weekend, was going to book something myself. But Santa Monica works for me as I am mostly in the west side of LA.
10/8/19, 2:08 PM - Lei W: If you do squats take care to have good form.  There's lots of YouTube tutorials but keeping your back straight (arched not rounded forward) and going down til your hip is equal or lower than your knee is 90% of it.
10/8/19, 2:10 PM - Lei W: Also I thought this applies to others only but upon rereading I realized I am also guilty.  Maybe my talent ceilings are higher than I thought they were.  https://trailrunnermag.com/training/what-is-impostor-syndrome-and-how-do-you-deal-with-it.html
10/8/19, 8:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hotel has free valet parking though I am sure you are a self-parking preferred person. 4 hr bike rental is included which should be perfect to ride to and from Getty Village for brunch Sunday (hopefully you can join me). There is also heated outdoor salt swimming pool which am excited about and use it as well as the gym on Mon before tackling meetings. I also really want to go to Getty Centre later afternoon on Sunday and somehow fit in a hike at sunset. So...hope your Sunday could be mostly with me, but no pressure.

10/8/19, 8:30 PM - Lei W: That's rare for a condo gym, nice!!
10/8/19, 8:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And last note before bed, I do not know you enough to accurately assess where you are overestimating or underestimating your potetial/ abilities yet but I do know that you are enough, you are highly talented in various ways, and though you should push you should try to be less hard on yourself.
10/8/19, 8:31 PM - Lei W: My plans are still fluid but I think we can fit most of those activities in
10/8/19, 8:32 PM - Sang Mi Lee: We all have insecurities, some we refuse to acknowledge. But with openness to grow emotionally, we can blossom.
10/8/19, 8:33 PM - Lei W: No matter talented 7 or talented 9 I will always try as hard as I can, but thanks for the support.
10/8/19, 8:33 PM - Lei W: Good night and sweet dreams!!
10/8/19, 8:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/8/19, 8:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And I love that about you.
10/9/19, 6:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So a little more elaboration on the above. So when we had a session in MBA where we had to imagine our funerals, most ppl were very surprised that what they wanted was not have ppl talk about what they had accomplished but rather be  remembered for how they touched others, how they loved well, how good of a mother/father/friend they were and be surrounded by people who truly loved them for who they were. When we had to share our thoughts, we were paired up for intimate conversation...and my partner, MD and VP of a major hospital who has an incredible career, created amazing humanitarian medical program in Pakistan, is wealthy, has beautiful wife and kids, head of his community, on TV, played some sport at a pretty high level etc started to cry and I asked him why. He said he knows there would be hundreds of ppl, especially as he is one to never say no and help anyone in any way possible on top of his professional career and connections, but one of the few ppl he really wants there may not be there. He met the love of his life after he was married with kids. She was single, divorced. He did separate from his wife for a few years and lived with her and even helped raise her kids, but ultimately due to many reasons he went back to his wife and he does not see her any more (as he felt it was unfair to both women). Anyhow it was hard to watch so much pain in such a man. And I was very thankful that I felt very much at peace and could smile thinking of my funeral and the warmth in the room and sweet love and comfort ppl in the room will provide each other as they recollect how I finished off their dinners or told them to accept that job etc. I just wanted to tell you about this because I am very impressed by just how much you have contributed to helping ppl learn, explore, grow, love...you are wonderful and I am so happy to be in your life.

10/10/19, 3:43 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 😆 love it! Imagining me next you in the car and keeping you company tuned me on fine too.

10/10/19, 2:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And it was Fortnite...the shooting each other game Jamie was trying to get me to play
10/10/19, 2:11 PM - Lei W: Yes fortnite is super popular I am ashamed as a supposed gamer that when I rattled off 7 or 8 shootemup games that I forgot to include it
10/10/19, 2:11 PM - Lei W: Like her cute dress too

10/10/19, 3:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I like! Thinking of Plato and some of our conversations...I raise my kids following his advice, an opposite approach to how I was raised but more in line with how my kids are taught in school. "Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.”
10/10/19, 7:56 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hey...I made reservations for brunch and dinner on Sunday. If you don't like one or both choices I can cancel no problem.
10/10/19, 7:56 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Brunch 12:30 at https://www.thehuntleyhotel.com/m/penthouse
10/10/19, 7:57 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Dinner at 8:30 at Cassia.
10/10/19, 8:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And meeting my friend after meetings at her office so will not leave the complete till just before 4pm. Totally understand if this does not work with your schedule to drive me back.
10/10/19, 8:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night 😘
10/10/19, 9:05 PM - Lei W: Brunch works, I told my friend we'll meet him at 230.  Dinner sounds good too, depending on what we do between 4 and 8.

4pm on Monday prob, need to be back in LA by 5pm
10/10/19, 9:06 PM - Lei W: Since I talked to you last, finally have a moment to myself, at the gym!
10/10/19, 9:06 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
10/11/19, 3:40 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Great. Yes, I thought you had said 5. I am sure they will let me store my luggage at their office. Besides I think with traffic etc. it would have been too tight anyway.
10/11/19, 3:41 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 👍

10/12/19, 12:47 PM - Lei W: Love it!!! See you soon can't wait.
10/12/19, 12:47 PM - Lei W: Still in meetings now
10/12/19, 2:54 PM - Lei W: Hopefully your flight takes off in 35 min and not further delayed.  Going climbing safe flight
10/12/19, 3:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just finishing up boarding so probably will take off in another 15...have fun.
10/12/19, 8:13 PM - Lei W: I'm parked 5 min from the airport. As soon as you touch down let me know I will drive in
10/12/19, 8:55 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just landed. Terminal 6.
10/12/19, 8:56 PM - Lei W: Omw
10/12/19, 9:12 PM - Lei W: I am at the right end of terminal 6 by viva aerobus sign in Van
10/12/19, 9:13 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Coming
10/12/19, 9:13 PM - Lei W: Lower level baggage claim by curb.  I can't park in garage and get you
10/12/19, 9:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am drinking complimentary champagne in the lobby
10/12/19, 9:53 PM - Lei W: Walking back
10/14/19, 3:23 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hey
10/14/19, 3:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I actually just finished and my friend had a last minute meeting
10/14/19, 3:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And just called uber
10/14/19, 3:25 PM - Lei W: Heading back to LA. Text me when you get to flight so I know you got there.
10/14/19, 3:25 PM - Lei W: Darn 10 min too late
10/14/19, 3:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Perfect, np
10/14/19, 3:26 PM - Lei W: Your meetings went well?
10/14/19, 3:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It went incredibly well
10/14/19, 3:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Very productive conversation and very interesting people
10/14/19, 3:27 PM - Lei W: Of course they did. 😁 Driving can't text well
10/14/19, 3:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Don't text. I am going to write you an email though, to get some of my thoughts/ reflections from this weekend down. Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, for this weekend!
10/14/19, 3:30 PM - Lei W: 🌹👍
10/14/19, 11:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/14/19, 11:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: The sun softly bid goodbye
Leaving us the passionate sky
 
From the orange full moon
We dip our toes in city maroon
 
Surrounded by ocean emerald blue
Bathing in our love pure and true
 
We gaze up at cosmos purple
Hearts united, bodies supple
10/14/19, 11:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just a fun poem
10/14/19, 11:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Of our hike

10/15/19, 2:46 PM - Lei W: Wonderful Toronto ☀ brings back memories
10/15/19, 7:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Almost time for bed...a couple of important meetings tomorrow. I had to power nap between the first 2 meetings of the day and stayed in pjs till I went to the gym before dinner. Last two weekends have motivated me to get in shape, was very proud of dragging my tired butt to the gym and felt great after.
10/15/19, 7:38 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 7:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My other best friend the math genius...I find her research fascinating but not entirely comprehensible with the level of math/computer science/engineering knowledge. https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4t7H0QQAAAAJ&hl=en
10/15/19, 7:41 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night my handsome, strong, intelligent bionic man...
10/15/19, 7:42 PM - Lei W: Going to the gym while tired is hard and takes a lot of will power but feels so rewarding afterwards!
10/15/19, 7:43 PM - Lei W: I agree with 0.9 out of the 4 descriptors.  Good night rest well
10/15/19, 8:12 PM - Lei W: Apparently her specialty is phylogenetic trees.  But I guess my understanding of them is lacking as I dont see the difficulty of the first paper at first glance.  But it would be an enlightening conversation
10/16/19, 9:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Going to bed and hopefully will see you in my dreams.❤
10/16/19, 9:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And send me some photos of last weekend, particularly of us?
10/17/19, 12:11 AM - Lei W: Yes will do sleep well
10/17/19, 8:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: One of the reasons why I love what I do...National Governors Association reached out to me today asking for a meeting to have in depth discussions on our strategy, opportunities, lessons learned etc. to help senior policy advisors of health policy in the US consider fresh ideas around balancing access and affordability of medicines. Obviously I will make a small contribution to their overall research but nonetheless makes me feel like I am making a difference. Hope you have a wonderful day, xo

10/17/19, 2:05 PM - Lei W: It's great having people being more aware of how you personally can make a difference for them
10/17/19, 2:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, chat then. Still have another meeting and a dinner meeting...the a sick child who will need lots of cuddles for bedtime before I tackle more work. Thx for the photos, they are fantastic. I miss you 🥰
10/17/19, 2:10 PM - Lei W: Cuddles are the best 🌈🥇
10/18/19, 1:05 AM - Lei W: https://www.amazon.com/Last-Dancer-Tales-Continuing-Time-ebook/dp/B004XNKOOC
10/18/19, 1:11 AM - Lei W: While sending you the other email links I saw this. Was my favorite book for more than a decade.  Main character is female, like in most of my favorite books.  Though a male writer's heroines are different than those written by women. Though I never did figure out if the title refers to the woman or her male antagonist.
10/18/19, 11:00 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Do you want photo credit on  Instagram? Happy to do that, though I only have very few ppl and is private account.
10/18/19, 11:00 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/18/19, 11:00 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Happy Friday!
10/18/19, 11:01 AM - Lei W: Sorry I don't see books in that photo let me concentrate
10/18/19, 11:02 AM - Lei W: Let me think about photo credit, my instinct is no for now
10/18/19, 11:03 AM - Lei W: Too cold for typical ACed libraries, normally food and drink are not allowed, think of the children!!!!
10/18/19, 11:04 AM - Lei W: Ah carpet that's someone's residence, in that case it's a dream come true fantasy
10/18/19, 11:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: From a photoshoot in a studio.
10/18/19, 11:23 AM - Lei W: Yes that makes sense as if it was a friend taking a photo he/she is pretty good at it

10/19/19, 1:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Well, less $100 to extend stay by 24 hours would likely at best break even, but certainly having an extra day of vacation at no/minimal incremental cost is certainly maximizing value.
10/19/19, 1:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/19/19, 1:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/19/19, 1:49 PM - Lei W: Yes the math is easy but judging whether I want to take an extra day off work is the hard part.
10/19/19, 1:50 PM - Lei W: El Dorado... There's gold in those thar hills
10/19/19, 1:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/19/19, 1:54 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Exactly. Which is especially why your rationale makes no  sense (ie booked a day early bc ticket cheaper) so next we chat you will have to explain the qualitative math and real reason on why you chose to go a day early.
10/19/19, 2:14 PM - Lei W: Everything makes sense! How's about I call you tomorrow night? 11et?
10/19/19, 8:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes that works. It just occurred to me I have my own real life Eat, Pray, Love story that would be even better...I am writing a book!
10/19/19, 8:13 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Slowly...of course...kinda behind on school work but thankfully based on my class What's App chat, I am not alone.
10/19/19, 8:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Back to this...Ice, Beach, Desert or Ice, Paradise, Home...need to contemplate when I am less exhausted later, but the three trips that have caused my exponential curve growth within myself, self-love, and exploring feelings for another...were Antarctica, Bali, and Nevada (Burning Man)...and, yes, a boy in each who helped me question and puzzle through love, with you getting me to this unbelievably beautiful and serene place I am in now. Infused with poetry and sketches...I am definitely absolutely writing this!! Good night 😘
10/19/19, 8:43 PM - Lei W: Good night and loving dreams

10/21/19, 1:10 AM - Lei W: I love it.  You are sexy to me whether in lingerie, sans clothes, or talking policy in a conservative suit...  Good rest and productive morning!

10/23/19, 3:53 PM - Lei W: Everyone's self conscious!  Models and plebians and everyday Joe's, it's human I guess.  We all need to work on it.  Talk to you tonight at 11!
10/23/19, 3:55 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 4:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ok on 11. If I were you, given your age and injuries etc. and your active lifestyle etc. I would be damn proud of that body.

10/23/19, 11:50 PM - Lei W: Smart and beautiful and 'girl next door' , the perfect combination.
10/24/19, 12:35 PM - Lei W: Rappelling and rafting combo tour in Arenal
10/24/19, 12:36 PM - Lei W: https://www.arenal.net/rappelling
10/24/19, 12:37 PM - Lei W: I'm sure there are more options also
10/24/19, 1:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Fantastic!
10/24/19, 1:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: But also ok with saving it for somewhere else per your email.
10/24/19, 1:31 PM - Lei W: The link above is where I booked hotel so it is definitely an option if we want it

10/25/19, 1:03 AM - Lei W: Yes there were more climbers than I've seen in a while and all ready to mingle but I had to run to eat and go to the gym before they close so didn't chat at all. This was the biggest stop on their tour but Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell were on the wall in Yosemite but Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds were doing a quick Q&A.  I didn't even stay for that.  (Brad was among my circle of friends in LA)
10/25/19, 1:06 AM - Lei W: I had never met Nina Williams but it's possible she will be in other stops like Toronto or next weekend in bishop which I am going to drop by for next weekend trip (tomorrow going to Vegas). Haven't done 2 weekends in a row outside in a while can't wait

10/25/19, 12:15 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh my gosh you are ridiculously adorable! Now I need to see a photo of you when you had a pony tail too.
10/25/19, 12:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I knew exactly where you were, actually very close to where I took John for dinner.
10/25/19, 12:22 PM - Lei W: I'll get you a pony tail pic when I get neck from Vegas. Good luck and fun Fri to you!

10/25/19, 6:56 PM - Lei W: On Train to airport now
10/25/19, 7:35 PM - Lei W: 45 min door to gate via public transportation that's as fast as I remember now 90 min to work or organize.  Your Fri night is relaxing instead of more prep time budgeted?
10/25/19, 8:04 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good observation. I remembered now that this is 2007 in fact and only time in my adult life that I was not my current weight but rather almost 10 lbs less (103 to 105) because of stress...just had a wedding that was difficult to plan (due to me not being into it) while I was a manager and trying to performance manage out a couple of employees and working 3 jobs (helping  friend who owned a pharmacy on every other Fri nights plus doing drug info to save money for the 30k wedding without using savings)...
10/25/19, 8:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Have an awesome time in Vegas! I am doing school work tonight but they say chance of Aurora so I will go for a walk before bed.
10/25/19, 8:06 PM - Lei W: Good luck on the Aurora as you don't need luck for work.

10/27/19, 6:07 AM - Sang Mi Lee: FYI, given I just complete my stats course and got A+ I must say this has rather misleading conclusions (missing variables, no adjustments for confounding variables). There is correlation between wealth and divorce (poor ppl can't afford to divorce esp if there are kids etc.) and correlation between wealth and education (esp for women having jobs etc.) and most of these wealthy and well educated people have bigger rings and more expensive weddings.
10/27/19, 6:02 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thx for the photos yesterday - looks like a fun group and the climb certainly did not look easy to me! Can't wait to be able to see you do that in person. When are you flying back?
10/27/19, 6:39 PM - Lei W: You bring up important points about the study but those may not be actually missing.  It is possible to control for wealth education the article isn't the abstract and doesn't say whether the conclusions tried to adjust for them or not, as these details may not be mentioned even if present originally. If you actually read the study then you would know.
10/27/19, 6:41 PM - Lei W: I'm at the airport now, flight in 1 hr landing midnight EST.  You ready for the start of the reporting? Had as much fun as the beautiful natural surroundings suggested?  I merely socialized today didn't climb at all.
10/27/19, 6:44 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Are you with company or can you talk?
10/27/19, 6:44 PM - Lei W: No I can talk, want me to call?

10/28/19, 11:41 AM - Lei W: Hope you are wowing them! Here's an album of the weekend and our friends house that everyone crashed at.  3200 sqft house feels huge compared to California ones. Though smaller than Texas ones
10/28/19, 8:36 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
10/28/19, 10:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Love it! I actually started my day with a tragic news about a pharmacy classmate of mine but the meeting went very well (at least from feedback I received) and had a wonderful fun evening...over too many glasses of wine and gin and Scotch though so I will be going straight to bed!
10/28/19, 10:42 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
10/28/19, 10:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thx! It is so nice to have glimpses into your life. XOXO

10/29/19, 4:19 PM - Lei W: She looks like someone I'd say yes to on a contract signing.  Congrats hope you can finally relax for (a few hours)
10/29/19, 4:29 PM - Lei W: From this pic I deduced you were at government building room 9820 107 st NW, AB T5K 1E4 with the sun setting to your left around 4pm local time is that right?  Didn't know that  the Saskatchewan river ran through Edmonton like the Seine does Paris
10/29/19, 4:30 PM - Lei W: Room - > roof
10/29/19, 4:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Wow, both Anch and I are very impressed. Dead on.
10/29/19, 4:37 PM - Lei W: Maybe impressive to you but useless skill as a software nerd lol.  Then again internet investigation skills are useful in general this century not just to PIs or detectives
10/29/19, 9:38 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Didn't do much of relaxing, rather made to do list for urgent deliverables coming out of the meeting, did on-line grocery shopping so I will have it delivered tomorrow, Halloween treat shopping for kids' classes, scheduled babysitting with my brother so I can get some school work done on Sat, made time for flu vaccines, etc. Home and in bed now...have to talk to some U of T grad students tomorrow...good night!! Hope you had a nice couple of days of work and rest/ sleep. 😘
10/30/19, 1:04 AM - Lei W: Yes caught up on my sleep 9 hrs on Sunday 9.5 hrs last night.  I forgot about Halloween candy have to buy some tomorrow!

11/2/19, 5:26 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Thanks darling. Actually I was there during their fashion week and did have ppl ask if I was in the fashion industry!

11/3/19, 7:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hope you had a great weekend ❤
11/4/19, 1:11 AM - Lei W: Sounds like a typical Sangmi day (tm). Somehow it always magically works out, no one else knows how.
11/4/19, 1:13 AM - Lei W: Felt like a weakling out at the real rocks. Now extra motivated to be less so next time.  19 hrs of driving over the weekend!!

11/4/19, 7:32 AM - Lei W: Have fun at Joe s! It was my first gym I went to regularly of any kind will always have fond memories.
11/4/19, 7:41 AM - Lei W: Listened to a podcast with Dierdre Wolownick on the drive back  at first I thought she was just cashing in her claim to fame of being Alex Honnold 's mom but starting with her walking into the climbing gym by herself as a 58 yr old knowing nobody there, it turned out to be one of the most inspiring people I've heard.
11/4/19, 7:44 AM - Lei W: The Sharp End of Life: A Mother's Story https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680512420/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_nBeWDb1NW3AEC

11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Lei W: Are you a fan of Korean movies? Or not really just as you have no time to watch movies of any type or culture ?
11/4/19, 3:05 PM - Lei W: Just discovered a new filmmaker maybe chat next call
11/4/19, 4:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Very little time for now but should have more next summer! Talk tomorrow or Wed?
11/4/19, 4:37 PM - Lei W: Wed? tomorrow is gym night for me

11/6/19, 11:38 PM - Lei W: She married a white guy (founded and still runs company with him) but divorced and went back to China to find a 'mail order husband' maybe 10 years ago
11/6/19, 11:38 PM - Lei W: I can tell he's a sweet nice guy
11/7/19, 1:39 AM - Lei W: Hoping he received it well
11/7/19, 4:48 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 4:52 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I had exactly same hair as her when throughout late high school and uni
11/7/19, 6:50 AM - Sang Mi Lee: So a real question...the image of you sexually with a really hot/great girl in front of me teasing me (with assumption you still want to be with me in terms of relationship) turns me on A LOT. Do you think that is bad?
11/7/19, 10:33 AM - Lei W: Can't quite imagine you with short Bob hair.
11/7/19, 10:39 AM - Lei W: Via text that's a good response but I feel he has a lot more emotions that he hasn't said but also processing himself.
11/7/19, 10:46 AM - Lei W: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckold?wprov=sfla1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckquean?wprov=sfla1
I've heard of only the male version but I'm sure it goes both ways.  I can totally understand your turn on though.  Maybe 3somes but never thought of the teasing part, now you have my imagination running wild I'm thinking it will be awesome for you if we do try it.  Probably easy to set up the main barrier is the participation of the hot girl-in-relationship i.e. You.
11/7/19, 10:52 AM - Lei W: Of the 4 variations, me you + 3rd, 3rd being male or female, and interacting mainly with you or me, it's probably 2nd most sexy from my point of view, after girl<>you, with guy <>me a no as I am not bi.  But the other 3 combinations maybe worth an experiment
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - Lei W: BTW I'd guess you are a bit sore from the gym but a good sore? 💪
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, he wrote that 5:30 am his time which is not a time he is normally up. And he read the message at 11:30pm his time the night before.
11/7/19, 12:54 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I will talk to him when I get a chance to see him next which will not be till early next yr.
11/7/19, 1:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Or with 2 others, boy and a girl - that works too. I am sure there are good sex parties and venues in SF. Things rarely distract me from work but I am done all my meetings and I am distracted by thought of you in a beautiful girl I am kissing or who is at same time going down on me........
11/7/19, 1:01 PM - Lei W: There is so much love and history between you two that I hope both of you make time to truly communicate properly. I really sympathize with both of you
11/7/19, 1:02 PM - Lei W: I'm being distracted too! Will try not to message you middle of day.  Sorry.  😕
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Lei W: Love and kisses

11/8/19, 12:29 AM - Lei W: I find your outfit really cute in this one.  And the photo authentic.  Urge to give you a deep hug
11/8/19, 12:33 AM - Lei W: Interesting. I will have to ask you more about your thought process.  And whether I had any thing to do with it
11/8/19, 1:05 AM - Lei W: I went through both websites and though the concept is interesting, I am still somewhat apprehensive.  The warnings makes it sound like it takes effort to say or hint no when there's pressure to mingle.  Skirt club sounds great for you, but as I am picky in body types I am attracted to not sure how I will feel.  But I still definitely want to go if you can have a good time, as it seems you have in the past.
11/8/19, 1:07 AM - Lei W: There are other ways other than swinger clubs also.
11/8/19, 1:48 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 1:49 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 3:51 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes that would work very well too. It really also depends on the mood...and the swinger club allows for just the two of us playing in front of ppl (which would turn me on maybe but not you?) We shall discuss further! :)
11/8/19, 3:53 AM - Sang Mi Lee: She is more muscular than I normally like the female body but I really love her smile...personality is very important for me to be attracted to men and women.
11/8/19, 3:53 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Lovely.
11/8/19, 10:48 AM - Lei W: I don't mind exhibitionism.  Just us playing doesn't have any requirements other than people so a good place to get started
11/8/19, 11:40 AM - Lei W: Of course personality is important and is only apparent when meeting, but body wise I'm curious what preferences you have.  Going to send you an email. The album is NSFW be warned
11/8/19, 12:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I don't even know what NSFW is but they were all in good taste and not very explicit. So...I indicated not necessarily just the type of body I like but which photos turn me on. So...you will notice, as much as I may find Asian body attractive I have never been sexually attracted to Asian women except ones who are very clearly mixed. Could be a mental thing but at this point that is where I am. And then body wise I appreciate some curves, I like looking at very cut body of women but sexually that is a big turn on for me for men but not so much for women.
11/8/19, 12:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: When are you having a next nude shot where I get to be your assistant? I can just hold the lights ;)
11/8/19, 12:28 PM - Lei W: NSFW acronym for (not safe for work) slang to warn people not to click on things if bosses or coworkers walk by and see itbl accidentally. But you are your own boss and know how to be discreet!  It's mostly used just in case people don't know what they are clicking on.  A habit I suppose, being so privacy and (random people being so sensitive) conscious
11/8/19, 12:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Haha, ppl know me very well and don't think anyone would be surprised with me. So to be clear beauty wise in terms of appreciation I can actually appreciate a very wide range. I have indicate my sexual attraction. I actually have my own boudoir photobook hidden here at work so my parents would not find it at home when they are babysitting.
11/8/19, 12:31 PM - Lei W: On my God that sounds awesome another thing I can't wait for.  You are such a temptress I find it astounding that I am only exploring this type of pleasure for the first time at my age... But so much better later than never.
11/8/19, 12:35 PM - Lei W: But really, my love for you is for your intellectual and personality side!!  But the physical side is making big statements..
11/8/19, 12:38 PM - Lei W: And one trend from your liked photos.. You are a butt person...   Confirmed.  😀😜👍
11/8/19, 1:07 PM - Lei W: Re: non Asian or mixed. Let's see how you feel about Costa Rican Hispanics..
11/8/19, 3:38 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hope you have a more fun evening planned than I, who will spend the entire night doing readings for school. I was so exhausted mentally from work today that I just actually watched Netflix (Explained)! Learned something new from episodes Coding (history re: inventor I didn't know before) and Billionaires (origin of work kleptocracy I did not know before). In fact, thx for the link on fluffer since I would have had to google it otherwise...given my current exhaustion my immediate thought was that seems like a fun, relaxing job over making recommendations on $400M/year drug funding.
11/8/19, 3:39 PM - Lei W: Run, climbing gym, and work is the order for my Fri night
11/8/19, 3:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And because I strangely seem to seek out crazy schedules, I got invitation to speak in this event https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/festival-of-biologics-usa/index.stm that falls during my very last MBA module so I am contemplating getting exemption on getting 1 day off from class right in the middle of 10 days of classes, taking a night (like a red eye) flight to San Diego Sun then speaking in 2 talks then flying red eye back right into classroom.
11/8/19, 3:41 PM - Lei W: I've learned that few things in the entertainment industry are relaxing jobs. Hollywood or porn.  So much pressure and long long hours
11/8/19, 3:41 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am going to go walk on treadmill while I read my articles. My brother will climb with me tomorrow morning before my Excel class.
11/8/19, 3:42 PM - Lei W: You are crazy that's what I'll agree with.
11/8/19, 3:42 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I can imagine! Lots of late nights too I am sure. Have a good evening!
11/8/19, 3:43 PM - Lei W: Nice! I smiled just thinking of that, he won't intrude on your social avoidance

11/9/19, 10:06 AM - Lei W: Good morning! I am on my way to Sacramento now. Going to visit Eli for the weekend. Will take him to bookstore and possibly climbing gym too. He's been before but still a little afraid of heights
11/9/19, 10:09 AM - Lei W: Nice. Hope you had a good time with bro, exercising like the old days. Bouldering with a harness on is a fashion faux pas but cute when you do it
11/9/19, 10:23 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Aww, please send a photo of cutie!

11/9/19, 5:21 PM - Lei W: Nice party. Enjoy and that reminds me it's time for my meal of the day and I'll cook some for Eli
11/9/19, 7:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: What did you make? There has been a lot of Sang Mi you are glowing, what is it...so hope you don't mind there has been a few ppl who have seen your photos :)
11/9/19, 8:42 PM - Lei W: Actually he didn't want to eat much so just some boiled dumplings and pasta. He really wanted Halloween candies instead but sugar makes him hyper
11/9/19, 8:44 PM - Lei W: Oh noes my photos. Now I'm self conscious!! ☺️🤭
11/9/19, 9:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Kids that age are pretty picky. I was lucky with Jamie but not so much with Mia. But on your body, my gay friend demanded photos and here was his response...you are obviously pretty f*ing hot
11/9/19, 9:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 9:22 PM - Lei W: Yes very flattering coming from gay friends.  Doesn't prevent me from seeing what I want to improve though! Body image psychology is complicated
11/9/19, 9:24 PM - Lei W: I could have gone to college at 14 but glad I delayed til later as life experience is so much more important than academics
11/9/19, 9:50 PM - Lei W: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaYEoA-aFIQ&feature=youtu.be
11/9/19, 9:50 PM - Lei W: Another amazing mom and nerd who helped her
11/9/19, 10:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you. I didn't think I told you how much I love interpretative/ modern dance. It is something I actually take time to see...
11/9/19, 10:04 PM - Lei W: https://youtu.be/rKwpAjhG-fk not as fancy as newer competitors but I like the performance and the moves starting at 3:20 makes me want to train harder
11/9/19, 10:06 PM - Lei W: You didn't but I never told you how much I like them, just sharing what I loved seeing.  😘
11/9/19, 10:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: She is beautiful..so effortlessly spinning, so graceful.
11/9/19, 10:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So grateful for my life and for the intimacy we get to share even from afar. ❤

11/10/19, 5:19 PM - Sang Mi Lee: First time I am bowling in about 15? years
11/10/19, 5:48 PM - Lei W: When I bowled for the first time in 5 years for friends bd party earlier this year I was the worst. I used to be good back in the day
11/10/19, 5:48 PM - Lei W: Call you tonight or tomorrow?
11/10/19, 6:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Am good tonight.
11/10/19, 6:06 PM - Lei W: K will call you in 1 hr 54 min 23s
11/10/19, 7:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/10/19, 10:00 PM - Lei W: That's a huge bed.  I suddenly have an image of you standing in front of the glass window without any clothes to tease people.

11/10/19, 10:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Of, not if
11/10/19, 11:21 PM - Lei W: That's beautiful.  Camera on timer? But dangerous photo... 😎 Bad girl
11/11/19, 3:23 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes timer. Sorry but you imagined it first...um, I need to be punished? (Nice thought to get myself out of bed.)
11/11/19, 3:19 PM - Lei W: Would you give a couple bottles  to an alcoholic who was reminiscing about a drink that would be oh so tasty?! I think not.  This tease definitely needs to be punished. Returned 3 fold, in person. I won't indulge your lurid fantasies by engaging in these kinds of conversations and telling you how some light spanking isn't going to cut it.  (today)
11/11/19, 3:24 PM - Lei W: That photo is just a silhouette but so distinctly you that it has a drastically different subconscious reaction from me.  Will tell you how my 'pleasure diet' is working better than I thought, next call.

11/11/19, 7:44 PM - Lei W: Bare legs in the snow.  Sacrifices for fashion!
11/11/19, 7:45 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It is beautiful here with the snow. Snow = not too cold with tights.
11/11/19, 7:45 PM - Lei W: Yesterday it was cold enough that I considered wearing a  hoodie over my shirt but decided against it.
11/11/19, 7:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I liked watching the climbing video and liked that my reaction was not I could never do that but rather I am excited to get better at it.
11/11/19, 7:47 PM - Lei W: 💪
11/11/19, 8:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Going to bed thinking of being in your arms 💋
11/11/19, 9:42 PM - Lei W: I'd love to hold you tight to fall asleep. 💕
11/12/19, 7:01 PM - Lei W: How's the proposal review from work? Not too much comments needed?
11/12/19, 7:27 PM - Lei W: Remember I said my weight loss was stalled?  if I eat as much as I want during  that one meal as the diet specifies, it's too much.  So starting 10 days ago I stopped even when I wasn't full, and been exercising 8 of 10 days.  My low after today's run was 0.6 from my goal of 135, from a fat high of 143 2 weeks ago.  So accounting for dehydration, only 2 lbs away maybe I will hit it before I get fat on vacation!
11/12/19, 7:30 PM - Lei W: Still, weight management is hard even when 3 times easier for me compared to other people. Especially when energy is needed to make work and activities less difficult
11/12/19, 7:31 PM - Lei W: Now for weights and core sets
11/12/19, 7:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Since he was acting for me today, he did not get a chance to complete it so I will have to review during my breaks/ in class tomorrow...which in a way I was happy about since I got to exercise a little too because of it.
11/12/19, 7:53 PM - Sang Mi Lee: That's great! I don't recall...is there a rationale that makes 135 the ideal weight for you?
11/12/19, 7:54 PM - Sang Mi Lee: If you want me to help you stay on diet during vacation I  can do that...maybe it will help me not overeat.
11/12/19, 7:55 PM - Lei W: No just an arbitrary number that I estimate is still healthy and close to maximum strength. Based on my all time highs and lows in adult life
11/12/19, 7:58 PM - Lei W: No need.  I intend to enjoy vacation as defined, just like eating normal meals with you during visits are cheat days, pleasure days, and bonding days.  3 bambis with one tungsten rod orbital Canon, so to speak
11/12/19, 8:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Do you have specific days you climb? Shall we talk tomorrow?
11/12/19, 8:11 PM - Lei W: No specific schedule depends on last session work schedule other agenda etc. I was going to go tomorrow but can talk and climb if we talk a bit earlier (1030?) and not much more than an hr
11/12/19, 8:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I might be out, it's ok.
11/12/19, 8:14 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Where are you now? Can I just say good night over the phone for a few min?
11/12/19, 8:14 PM - Lei W: Sure I can call you now
11/12/19, 8:15 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ok
11/12/19, 8:50 PM - Lei W: You can... Be as happy as I am when looking forward to seeing each other... 💘💞
11/13/19, 3:48 AM - Sang Mi Lee: In the spirit of helping you - this is example of communication style that would make some ppl uneasy. What I heard from this is "I want to climb tomorrow but I would love to talk to you so if we talk a little earlier than normal we would have an hour before I have to go." In other words, I saw you as being sweet. However, other people could have read it as "I suppose if you want to talk, I can inconvenience myself to make an hour tops for you." Directness and efficiency to communication, esp written, for many ppl come across cold and short. You can get away with it more as a man at work, esp to another man, but even professionally you need to watch your audience. My email to a female patient advocate extremely different from email to male economist consultant in tone and words I choose.
11/13/19, 4:03 AM - Lei W: Aha, this is a possible learning opportunity for me, as I don't get the cold and short part at all.  My intention was, you asked if I could talk on Wed, I already had plans but could still talk until 1130 and starting 30 min earlier would give us an hour.  Dropping my own plans altogether or saying no were the alternatives, and I would have communicated the same to anyone.  So I'd love to hear what I am missing
11/13/19, 4:08 AM - Lei W: I woke up from your message and thought it was interesting enough to reply before I went back to sleep, instead of waiting til the day.  I wish I could give you a kiss and a hug right now! 😘
11/13/19, 4:13 AM - Lei W: Maybe different words can be 'I was going to go to the gym by 830 do you think we have time before that?'
11/13/19, 4:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes! Exactly. You are a fast learner. I got your intent rather than what you wrote, you have to remember communication is not a transmission of info but it has to transmit your intent and feelings too.
11/13/19, 4:22 AM - Lei W: Have a great day at school! This is the first time we exchanged messages at the start of your day, and I want to say I really miss you right now, your presence and your touch.
11/13/19, 7:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Love, I really did not intend to wake you. Even this message is probably too early for you too but I am on break and wanted to say I miss your embrace and thank you for your beautiful message to start my day.

11/13/19, 5:59 PM - Lei W: Looks like paradise and lots of fun, plus your red swimsuit makes you stand out even more!
11/13/19, 6:06 PM - Lei W: Don't worry about waking me, i manage my interruptions like you do yours! I rarely hear or check notifications when sleeping but just happened to be near a light sleep cycle at 4am today(my time).  Plus once I read the message it really piqued my curiosity and also wanted to say hi before your day started.  Really glad I shared my thoughts instead of just going back to sleep immediately.
11/13/19, 6:15 PM - Lei W: By 'your touch' it sounds like I was horny but I really meant I just wanted to hold you in my arms close to go back to sleep.  Though if I magically teleported into your bed then it would be almost impossible for me to resist your body's beauty... 👩‍❤️‍👨

11/13/19, 6:22 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 8:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I understood what you meant but really appreciate you saying I would be sexually irresistible...since even your new profile photo's playful look made me rather aroused.
11/13/19, 8:19 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You are adorable...basically just a week till I see you!
11/13/19, 8:28 PM - Lei W: Heading to gym now.  That profile photo of mine I did 5 years ago the one and only time I set up lights to take my own photo for some business cards I was going to make.  Little motivation as only other people are interesting enough to make the effort! Though I am nervous about yours as it would be hard to equal my inner mind's standards. Hope your are having fun with your besties

11/13/19, 9:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/14/19, 11:25 AM - Lei W: On the other hand, 'not great' photos I like because I know I'm the only person who you are comfortable sharing it with, and that makes me feel special.   On the other hand this one isn't one of those. 😘
11/14/19, 11:27 AM - Lei W: Wanted to say I felt great writing you that email.   Sending you 💖 mid day.
11/14/19, 11:30 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>

11/14/19, 8:20 PM - Lei W: Daydreaming is very useful for boredom and invention alike!
11/14/19, 8:23 PM - Lei W: I can't decide if I loved the above photo or should jokingly chide you for bending my (no explicit photos of you) suggestion.  What do you think? Do you deserve praise or retribution?
11/15/19, 3:33 AM - Sang Mi Lee: It was definitely inconsiderate of me (being serious now, actually)...poor judgement post 6 drinks! But you can practice forgiveness a very important part of relationships. 💋
11/15/19, 9:48 AM - Lei W: Well it's definitely a photo I'd love to see except for my own weird 'experiment' that has the opposite needs as is typical.  Plus it is barely more scandalous than the other photos you've sent before.  So I forgave you as soon as stopped smiling and shaking my head at it.
11/15/19, 9:52 AM - Lei W: Let alone after 6 drinks! In fact I want to make it clear that I encourage sending photos in this vein in the future, after I stop with my thing in CR.  Still, I will have to use my mock 'anger' to our advantage next week... 😎
11/15/19, 11:12 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Looks like we should find another time to talk since you should enjoy your time with your friends and I have a rather early and long Mon (all day national biosimilar stakeholder consultation I have funded and on advisory committee for, then evening of patient advocacy group's gala dinner). What about tonight 9:30pm your time, or tomorrow am when you wake up? (My Nov 16 12:30 am or early afternoon)
11/15/19, 11:15 AM - Lei W: Any time from 10et tonight to tomorrow 5et is good for me.  I don't mind talking earlier as I wake up around 8ampt but stay in bed reading for a bit usually
11/15/19, 11:17 AM - Lei W: I am really looking forward to our call based on our email conversation.  💓
11/15/19, 11:20 AM - Lei W: Just text me a preferred time.  Haven't talked to you in the morning before, 1030 or 11et tomorrow am if you want me to pick
11/15/19, 11:30 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Let's do 11am-ISH ET tomorrow. In other words, you call when you wake up and read a bit and ready to chat. I am free till 4pm ET anyway. Looking forward to it ❣
11/15/19, 11:30 AM - Lei W: It's a date!
11/15/19, 3:39 PM - Lei W: Though I might be calling you a few min later than 11am and I'll tell you why on the phone
11/15/19, 7:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Remember I said there has to be an app for that? Well, one of my close Mmarried but open male bi/pan classmate showed me the Feeld app. So, there is an app for that.
11/15/19, 8:06 PM - Lei W: 😽
11/15/19, 9:41 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 9:42 PM - Lei W: Good night!
11/16/19, 1:19 PM - Lei W: Apparently there were around a million and a half people trying to get tickets for SDCC and 130k tickets available.  So 1 in 10 chance.  I got lucky just like with BM.
11/16/19, 1:21 PM - Lei W: And in other news, I went to a different spa for massage just now and masseuse had interesting techniques but pressure wasn't as good as last time.  No funny business though! Thank God. But it was more expensive at $90 for the hour plus tip.  Other place was half price I guess they depend on happy ending tips to make up the difference
11/16/19, 1:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Talking about massage, last night I was in my bathing suit (went to hotel hot tub) having champagne in my bi/pan classmate,'s Ritz Carlton room and giving my data scientist friend a massage (she has chronic pain problem) while talking to 2 other classmates (men) about life, love (yes, you), etc. No happy endings or awkwardness for anyone, though yes I am sure boys enjoyed watching the massage.
11/16/19, 1:28 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 1:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And lovely curves
11/16/19, 1:30 PM - Lei W: Yes would be fun to watch even if it's better to participate!

11/16/19, 1:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hahaha...damn I want that batgirl? Outfit
11/16/19, 1:35 PM - Lei W: Oh we would kill it if we dressed up for Halloween
11/16/19, 1:35 PM - Lei W: Warning next photo is me in my slutty costume
11/16/19, 1:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Don't leave me in suspense
11/16/19, 1:38 PM - Lei W: Hold on trying to find it!
11/16/19, 1:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You are such a tease...I want you so badly...
11/16/19, 1:40 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 1:41 PM - Lei W: I never tease I don't know how 🙈
11/16/19, 1:43 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 1:44 PM - Sang Mi Lee: All I can think of is how I want to run my tongue all over that hot body of yours
11/16/19, 1:45 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Literally having my heart race thinking of you
11/16/19, 1:45 PM - Lei W: Uh oh I have awoken the succubus.  For the safety of my soul (and self control) I'm going back to work...
11/16/19, 1:47 PM - Lei W: Catwoman played in various movies by Michelle Pfeiffer, Halle Berry, Anne Hathaway in more recent movies
11/16/19, 1:49 PM - Lei W: There was a super sexy one last year but I wasn't able to get a photo due to bad luck
11/16/19, 4:59 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just finished 1/3 papers I need to write this weekend. Wanted to say I was turned on not just by your body but your personality and humor that comes through.
11/16/19, 5:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And when I talk about playing with others it is not at all because you alone is not enough.
11/16/19, 5:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have had many opportunities where I could have tried to find another girl to join etc but never cared so much for the man I was with (my FWB or fling etc) to want to plan for adventures together.
11/16/19, 5:04 PM - Sang Mi Lee: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/oakland-poly-happy-hour-december-tickets-81882030357?aff=ebdssbdestsearch Because my SF friend said his friend recently went to a private swinger party, I just looked at various events in Bay area around sex talks, classes, parties, etc.
11/16/19, 5:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Not saying you should go but rather that I am not that unique in this regard.
11/16/19, 5:11 PM - Lei W: I'll check out that link but I'm wary of events that lets single men in. 😁 Just got to the gym glad to hear you were productive 🏅 me too.
11/16/19, 5:11 PM - Lei W: Reply in a few hrs
11/16/19, 9:03 PM - Lei W: Well I do pretend for the sake of photos.  It's all Hollywood?
11/16/19, 9:05 PM - Lei W: Yes I know that.  Then again even the most awesome person in the world 's SO could fantasize plus even if I were not enough I would want you to get what you want.
11/16/19, 9:08 PM - Lei W: As for the happy hour I probably won't go by myself as that'd be awkward for anyone and I am especially bad at pretending to be social let alone a poly explorer.
If you are sleeping soon sweet dreams! Really enjoyed our conversation this am.
11/17/19, 8:40 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/17/19, 11:05 AM - Lei W: Great! Yes hands hurt quickly  the first few weeks but pain goes away unless coming back from a long break.  They get used to the texture.
11/17/19, 11:07 AM - Lei W: Happy to see you are making use of your initial month. Looking forward to going to a gym together like last time.

11/17/19, 3:06 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I find the girl furthest away from you very attractive and the other two not so much purely on facial attributes.
11/17/19, 3:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am so tired. I ended up having to work all afternoon, even taking a teleconference.  The national biosimilar consultation event tomorrow  is a fruit of my very hard work getting the funding and my strategic brainchild. We have European and Kaiser experts speaking in addition to Canadian ones and will have all important stakeholders in one room and recently have had some patient advocates who have been lobbying vehemently against some policies...so had to put together some risk mitigation plan. Then I am going to dinner hosted by one of these groups because of the concept Keep your friends close and your enemies closer...and missing a colleague's retirement party! I now have to write outline of my 3rd paper and finish on flight. And I had time for either a haircut or massage so chose haircut and expecting you to give me a massage with a happy ending when I see you! Hope you are having a great hoke and thx for reading my complaints!
11/17/19, 6:44 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hike that is! Feeling much better after letting go of pressure to do my paper (that's what airport/ airplanes are for) and going to bed. Would love see a photo from your day when I wake up. 💋from your 🦋
11/17/19, 8:35 PM - Lei W: I agree with you!
11/17/19, 8:38 PM - Lei W: Must be proud of your brainchild! Massage definitely incoming but I try to be professional... Unless client has extra knot in specific place... 😋
11/17/19, 8:39 PM - Lei W: Really 👍👍👍 you choose rest over more work

11/18/19, 1:51 PM - Lei W: Went to a fashion photo shoot someone organized, one of the other guys was the head photographer for long Beach community events. He invited me to be one of the shooters for a pageant a month later. That was my first and Moniques first and she won.

11/18/19, 7:25 PM - Lei W: Good luck on getting your whole task list this week checked as quickly as you d like
11/18/19, 7:25 PM - Lei W: I'm listening to a nasa pm talk on voyager will tell you about what I learned later
11/18/19, 7:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I would love to meet your mom one day, even just introduced as your friend.
11/18/19, 7:31 PM - Lei W: I'm sure she'd love to meet you too.
11/18/19, 7:32 PM - Lei W: 💕😚
11/18/19, 7:33 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have another all day meeting tomorrow to work on innovative solutions to expensive rare disease drugs...need my brain to be sharp again (not so much right now, maybe wine maybe overuse). xoxo
11/18/19, 7:34 PM - Lei W: 🛏️🌛
11/18/19, 7:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Btw when "market penetration" was mentioned today all I could think temporarily of was you penetrating me...guess I miss you a lot ;)
11/18/19, 7:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Off I go
11/18/19, 8:12 PM - Lei W: Oh really? Penetrating where? 😋 Instructions unclear will have to try a few different things til I get it right
11/19/19, 5:03 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 5:03 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 12:05 PM - Lei W: Hmm though I was joking about the previous dark dress, this one is less overtly sexy. I don't even know why.  Maybe the flowers? Or the smaller but more attention grabbing gap between skirt and boots in previous one.  Interesting
11/19/19, 12:06 PM - Lei W: The ponytail is cute
11/19/19, 4:02 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hey, would we have 30 min to chat today or tomorrow? Any time after 6pm PT (9pm) would work  It would just be nice to hear your voice.
11/19/19, 4:04 PM - Lei W: How about 6? 30 min is good I was going to go to the gym around 630 anyway
11/19/19, 4:06 PM - Lei W: Would be great to chat before I pack for trip
11/19/19, 4:07 PM - Lei W: I can imagine you are having a packed day again..
11/19/19, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Today or tomorrow? Call me whenever.
11/19/19, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes still some work to do but it would be good to take a short break
11/19/19, 4:08 PM - Lei W: Oh right I thought you meant today.  Tomorrow OK too
11/19/19, 4:08 PM - Lei W: I'll call you at 6 today then
11/19/19, 4:09 PM - Lei W: In 1 hr 54 min rather
11/19/19, 4:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Perfect
11/19/19, 7:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Darling, when you said you had never before really looked forward to the physical part of relationship as much, it made me feel a little worries that then what you really needed before in a relationship is something you may not be getting enough of in ours. We will chat in person but even though I am busy, yes, I would happily lose sleep and reorganize my schedule for you, as I do with my kids.
11/19/19, 7:06 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh...and let me know your comfort level with me using words like "darling" and such...
11/19/19, 8:14 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 8:14 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 9:39 PM - Lei W: I like it when you use those words. In fact I kept wanting to ask you what you prefer but will have to wait till the weekend, baby babe love dear hon honey bunches of oats. 🤭
11/19/19, 9:41 PM - Lei W: Physical... Yes that's a valid concern for any long distance one, but I am ahead of you in that and will reassure you in person about it.
11/19/19, 9:42 PM - Lei W: BTW this is such an awesome photo that it looks like a photo shop.  Sweet dreams!
11/20/19, 12:08 AM - Lei W: And I would like to hear about times when you have had bad stress and need a shoulder to lean on, so I know what to keep an ear out for.
11/20/19, 12:11 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 5:09 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Sweetheart, I mean that if you have always valued the physical proximity and companionship and you feel that distance is a barrier, I am happy to try to find solutions that work to improve that, and can find time.
11/20/19, 5:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: You can call me whatever you want...maybe a genie for the trip since I can't wait to satisfy your (hmm and my) every desire.
11/20/19, 5:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 5:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 8:20 AM - Lei W: So cute! Like a flight attendant supervisor
11/20/19, 8:22 AM - Lei W: Indeed let's talk about what we can do for the both of us to scratch the itch
11/20/19, 8:24 AM - Lei W: Off to tie off loose ends at work last day for a week.  Have a good day yourself my lovely genie!
11/20/19, 3:47 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 3:59 PM - Lei W: I almost forgot about your office Pic. Great to see! Not enough paper nor enough of a mess.  My desk almost always worse even with less going on.
11/20/19, 4:00 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 4:02 PM - Lei W: Difference mainly because my work is all on a screen and yours much more human related
11/20/19, 4:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes there are two chairs on the other side of my desk and they are well used and I do have sliding doors for some privacy. Also there is a divider that does not go up to the ceiling between my office and a meeting room next to me that we use for more human interaction :)
11/20/19, 5:12 PM - Lei W: As in throwing humans through the gap between divider and ceiling back and forth ? Great exercise I agree.
11/20/19, 5:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You made me laugh! I needed that today. 😘
11/20/19, 5:40 PM - Lei W: You think I joke?! About exercise?! I wouldn't even bring it up if it were illegal in Canada.  Just not in Florida and NY. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf-tossing?wprov=sfla1
11/20/19, 6:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So, since you will be there a day early you should buy some honey and chocolate syrup...because I will be hungry when I get in but will not be able to resist you to eat...so I could just lick honey and chocolate off your yummy body
11/20/19, 7:55 PM - Lei W: Hmm what if I get chocolate and honey instead? Does the order matter? Let's find out... We will do a feasibility study 🤓👨‍🏫
11/20/19, 7:56 PM - Lei W: Meanwhile did some last minute shopping, packing time as it would be difficult to get up earlier than 4am tomorrow to prep for flight
11/20/19, 7:57 PM - Lei W: At least I might be up almost as early as you for once
11/21/19, 4:11 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I still woke up earlier but you must be stirring out of bed now...send me messages of how your flights/ layovers go throughout the day! Can't wait to kiss you.
11/21/19, 4:45 AM - Lei W: Can't wait either.  Got up at 4 was in shower when you messaged now in Uber 20 min from airport. Train doesn't run this early bus too slow.
11/21/19, 4:47 AM - Lei W: 💓
11/21/19, 5:41 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am actually flying out at 8:05 am on 27th now so will be going to airport with you. Kids related.
11/21/19, 5:42 AM - Lei W: Hope everything is fine too bad you don't get to relax for one more day
11/21/19, 6:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, all good...and in fact it will be nice to even have that extra 2 hrs with you 💋
11/21/19, 6:12 AM - Lei W: 💋👫
11/21/19, 7:01 AM - Lei W: About to take off. Will have suffice again around 3pm et
11/21/19, 7:02 AM - Lei W: ^Service
11/21/19, 11:20 AM - Lei W: Now a 4 hr layover good thing I have lots to read
11/21/19, 11:53 AM - Sang Mi Lee: What are you reading?
11/21/19, 11:56 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Which airport are you at?
11/21/19, 11:57 AM - Lei W: Atlanta.  Lots of non fiction, from finance to self improvement
11/21/19, 11:58 AM - Lei W: Haven't been back to SE us since ninja warrior 2015
11/21/19, 11:59 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Where are you flying through on the way back?
11/21/19, 11:59 AM - Lei W: How's your day going?
11/21/19, 11:59 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Very well actually, very productive...but I am a bit worn down.
11/21/19, 12:00 PM - Lei W: On the way back stop in LA with only an hr layover
11/21/19, 12:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am flying through Atlanta on my way back now
11/21/19, 12:01 PM - Lei W: Well coasting to maintain the same energy won't make much difference so that's my recommendation
11/21/19, 12:01 PM - Lei W: Darn we are crossed
11/21/19, 12:09 PM - Lei W: Forbes: Telegram Founder Says Users Should 'Delete WhatsApp'.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/11/21/telegram-founder-says-users-should-delete-whatsapp/
11/21/19, 12:09 PM - Lei W: Read only if you are bored.  Click bait headline, it's not as bad as the guy says, as a competitor he is a bit biased
11/21/19, 3:01 PM - Lei W: Turning off phone flight about to take off landing 930
11/21/19, 3:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 3:50 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 6:50 PM - Lei W: Yes it's great but make sure the person that was in it is included, super important
11/21/19, 6:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Do you need me to being anything you forgot/ want?
11/21/19, 6:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I will go to hed soon so I can rest up but do send a note when you get settled in, love.😘😘
11/21/19, 6:52 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 6:53 PM - Lei W: Think I overpacked but if I think of anything I'll let you know
11/21/19, 7:02 PM - Sang Mi Lee: We have more than enough fun to be had between hot springs, our bed, nd our minds regardless of nature's desire to cooperate ... but forecast looks fine :)
11/21/19, 7:26 PM - Lei W: Weather is fine the fogged window is a joke. 😜 But the money exchange rate of the counter by baggage claim is also a joke.  17% commission?!! Good thing I math
11/21/19, 7:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Best phrase ever. Good thing I math. I am totally going to use it in a presentation in front of 200ppl
11/21/19, 7:49 PM - Lei W: I blame ESL and the American educational system. 🤣🤓🙈 Or thank, depending on reception
11/21/19, 8:55 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 4:08 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I like the paintings! Wish I could get on a flight now...miss the warmth of your body, your strong hands, you smile and lips...
11/22/19, 6:43 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 6:44 AM - Lei W: Glad to know that I will be able to hold you before I sleep today. 😘
11/22/19, 6:53 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Beautiful!!! One important meeting at 11am et and then I am going to turn off work from my mind (though I will work on my paper, it will be nice to put on an out if office on my work email that says "with no access to email")
11/22/19, 6:58 AM - Lei W: Doka Estate Costa Rica Coffee Tour & Plantation

129, Provincia de Alajuela, Alajuela
2449 5152

https://g.co/kgs/VpY7bo
11/22/19, 6:59 AM - Lei W: Would you want to do the coffee tour? Host recommended it and it is closer to San Jose can do it on the way to La Fortuna
11/22/19, 6:59 AM - Lei W: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g309227-d943427-Reviews-Doka_Estate_Coffee_Tour-Poas_Volcano_National_Park_Province_of_Alajuela.html
11/22/19, 7:20 AM - Lei W: Otherwise I am considering whether to go and take some pictures if not drink.
11/22/19, 7:51 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I love coffee plantations so yes! And one of my best friends already asked me to bring back some local coffee
11/22/19, 7:53 AM - Lei W: Perfect that's our first Costa Rican thing planned for tomorrow
11/22/19, 12:17 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:23 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I just got through security and sat down with a nice cup of tea.
11/22/19, 12:25 PM - Lei W: Isn't your flight at 530et?
11/22/19, 12:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes but I could not check in online so I got here early...it was because they didn't have my return ticket info.
11/22/19, 12:27 PM - Lei W: Interesting same with me.  Wonder if it's Costa Rica or the airlines
11/22/19, 12:28 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 12:30 PM - Lei W: So excited that I hate to leave you to your fun.  But my food arrived so too bad.  😁
11/22/19, 12:32 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Mean!
11/22/19, 1:24 PM - Lei W: FYI there are few places open late near hotel I recommend eating something before landing
11/22/19, 1:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I already told you I am just having you for dinner
11/22/19, 1:29 PM - Lei W: Alrighty time to fatten myself up
11/22/19, 2:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: On the plane now...
11/22/19, 2:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I bought some food for the flight so don't worry, I won't just depend on adrenaline and dopamine from seeing you to keep my hunger in check while we enjoy each other...
11/22/19, 2:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Pushing off the gate, will turn off my phone.
11/22/19, 2:30 PM - Lei W: K at market trying to find chocolate.  Safe flight!
11/22/19, 7:11 PM - Lei W: I am just outside where you should be coming out of the building
11/22/19, 7:20 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thx love, I just landed.
11/22/19, 7:28 PM - Lei W: You don't have luggage right? If you don't see me text me
11/22/19, 7:28 PM - Lei W: You will prob get through everything at 940
11/24/19, 5:48 AM - Sang Mi Lee: You need to being the voucher in the envelop

11/26/19, 10:21 AM - Lei W: 10 people in line be a bit
11/27/19, 4:39 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am going to go through security and shop at duty free for a couple of little gifts for kids. It is just past security and you have to walk through it to get to gates so I should see you come through.
11/27/19, 4:41 AM - Lei W: I bet your gate is close to mine. Meeting past security sounds best. I've been waiting in shuttle bus last 10 min but leaving now be there in 10
11/27/19, 4:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Customs and security took 3 min flat
11/27/19, 4:47 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Store has 8 blends of coffee samples...I am happy ;)
11/27/19, 4:53 AM - Lei W: 👍😁
11/27/19, 4:54 AM - Lei W: Walking in to airport
11/27/19, 5:45 AM - Lei W: Safe flight! Love you 💖
11/27/19, 5:57 AM - Sang Mi Lee: On the runway. Thank you so much most of all for your time, attention, and love. I love you too, have a good trip home. 🤗
11/27/19, 11:32 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Boarded flight to TO. Prepped my talk for tomorrow's conference on last flight, I actually meant to practice it in front of you once (because I never do and I should, and it would be interesting to hear your take). Next time :) ... miss you already!
11/27/19, 1:36 PM - Lei W: Just landed, went through customs, now through security again and waiting for sfo flight which is at 6et.
11/27/19, 1:37 PM - Lei W: Love to hear it whether you need feedback or not. However we can do that over voice or video chat if you like.
11/27/19, 1:38 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
11/27/19, 1:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just landed in TO. Favour pls, send me the video of me zip lining on the cable that had view of 2 waterfalls when you get a chance? Fondly remembering all the fun and conversations over the last few days xoxo
11/27/19, 1:45 PM - Lei W: Google says your flight landed 437 so pretty accurate.  If course I will send you the videos, all later but I'll upload that one now while I wait

11/27/19, 2:37 PM - Lei W: CNN: Tokyo's famous Sukiyabashi Jiro sushi restaurant removed from Michelin Guide.
https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/jiro-sushi-michelin-tokyo-intl-hnk/index.html
11/27/19, 2:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Interesting. In fact it is known that there is high rate of mental health/ stress issues for chefs due to poor hours, pace of work, competition, etc...how to do what you love in an elite level without losing your love for the work...answer seems to be evasive for a lot of ppl
11/27/19, 2:48 PM - Lei W: I don't think it's possible. One person's sacrifice of self or family for excellence is the price for being the best.   People who are sane and lose love if overworked without balance will be exceeded by those whose childhood trauma make them obsessed without burnout
11/27/19, 2:50 PM - Lei W: But elite without being #1 is doable without pain or suffering
11/27/19, 3:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Stuck in traffic in a cab but ordered myself Korean which is waiting for me along with kiddos. I was looking at NYC dates (Jan 18 AM -21 night) so I looked at Ninja Warrior page to see if there were conflicts for you and found this - that says you need to apply by Dec 6, though I assume you know... https://www.anwcasting.com/
11/27/19, 3:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Btw I meant losing your love for the work you do and NOT losing ppl you love because of your work...ie you lose enjoyment (love) of the work you used to love in the process of getting to the top...
11/27/19, 3:12 PM - Lei W: Yes I know which is why I said obsession without burnout.
11/27/19, 3:14 PM - Lei W: Deadline used to be mid Jan they move it earlier every year. Likely not applying this year not enough prep
11/27/19, 3:15 PM - Lei W: Taking off enjoy the food I am looking forward to some dumplings myself when I get home
11/27/19, 8:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: This made me think - in Nicaragua we should work on independently and together setting goals for 2020 using a well validated tool (template)...professional, personal, relationship, parental, etc. And build into it how we will support and push each other with love and encouragement and in absence of judgement and criticisms. It will also help us with important dates and trips. Yes I am a little a type A...but when you do this exercise with me how much I am not also. Love you darling.

11/27/19, 8:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Mia handed this to me as soon as she hugged me, I could have said that I drew like this at 2 and I was winning water colour art competitions at 5 but that would have destroyed her spirit.
11/27/19, 8:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night my love!
11/27/19, 8:17 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 12:10 AM - Lei W: Yes no more holding back. 😋
11/28/19, 12:12 AM - Lei W: Yes but let me think about the OKRs and how they will be visible instead of personal
11/28/19, 12:12 AM - Lei W: You deleted this message
11/28/19, 12:13 AM - Lei W: Just got back from movie, sleeping finally
11/28/19, 7:51 AM - Lei W: Woke up and I think I know exactly how I want to do it. Yes looking forward to chatting about it in person.
11/28/19, 7:53 AM - Lei W: Also thought about pressure in general and how we differ in personality and how they might be handled differently
11/28/19, 7:54 AM - Lei W: My mom reached out and we will talk this afternoon will tell you how that goes been 6 months
11/28/19, 7:56 AM - Lei W: Watching the second of the two big climbing Olympic qualification events on YouTube today. 10 hours or so over two days.  (Hachioji was the 1st)
11/28/19, 8:12 AM - Lei W: Re: pressure, an example is I will try to text or reply when I want to, instead of my instinct of trying to match or exceed your communications in whatever way, like Sheldon in BBT. (unless timing is important for some subject ie. Im ordering X waiting to hear if you like or dislike it)
11/28/19, 10:20 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Just realized it is your Thanksgiving. Seems like an appropriate day to talk to your mom, and yes I would love to hear how it went. Maybe you can tell her you have a friend who would would like to meet her. Have I told you how when I was a kid I idolized Marie Curie? I hope it doesn't make you feel annoyed that I truly would love to talk to her one day and hear her life story from her perspective.

11/28/19, 10:22 AM - Sang Mi Lee: In a cab back to work (from home, for rest of the day) and want to say I saw this earlier and felt relieved. I had no idea this even crossed your mind...ie making sure you reciprocated same level of communication...
11/28/19, 10:27 AM - Lei W: Not that I communicated only because of that. I sent a lot without thinking today, comparedly.  Pressure is everywhere I am just trying to identify them.
11/28/19, 10:28 AM - Lei W: Sad news Brad Gobright died last night in Mexico, maybe even when my plane was flying over monterrey from SJO.  Some lessons there but also not surprising unfortunately
11/28/19, 10:29 AM - Lei W: Great to hear that 👍
11/28/19, 5:14 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just sent some stream of consciousness precipitated by my friend asking himself "What's the point of all this [success, money, life etc.]?" Long and rambly, sorry, no need to read till you have 15 min ish of aloneness at least.
11/28/19, 7:19 PM - Lei W: Long ramblings, like I do sometimes, are better because they are not filtered. As long as equally detailed replies are not required.  So yes to all your questions.
11/28/19, 7:47 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
11/29/19, 7:34 AM - Lei W: I am really happy that I can sleep early and able to get up at 6am last few days. It usually doesn't last but hope it does longer this time. Now time to watch a bit of the competition in Toulouse before I work. No one else working on Black Friday so I cheat to get ahead
11/29/19, 7:35 AM - Lei W: Will tell you about my convos with mom and dad when we talk, and one more interesting thing we didn't chat about in CR

11/29/19, 8:42 PM - Lei W: Sun night or sat or mon all work. Pick one
11/29/19, 8:44 PM - Lei W: Olympic qualifiers just finished pretty exciting. Just like Tokyo, more important than the finals
11/29/19, 8:50 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You can show me your fav clips next time we are together. Mia asked me tonight when we can go climbing together so will take them on Sun.
11/29/19, 8:53 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Sunday so I can tell you about climbing with kids? Plus say how I finished my big paper on Sat night (trying to motivate myself by telling you this...if I put off talking to you to write a paper then I will have to force myself to get it done even though it is not due till next week Sat).
11/29/19, 10:09 PM - Lei W: Sun it is!
11/30/19, 5:46 AM - Lei W: Re: trying to assist with sleep should we start at time other than 11et

11/30/19, 6:24 AM - Lei W: Their mobile site is iffy but try clicking the expand comments link if you see it too be able to scroll
11/30/19, 7:20 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Hmm...nothing surprising, all pretty relatable (except liking being woken up in the middle of the night with sex by your husband, haha). I don't find much in life repulsive... 

There is a reason why I ask you to help me sleep on vacation (because I know I will not get as much until then). You can call me at 10:30 if you are able, but I won't be able to talk earlier!
11/30/19, 7:29 AM - Lei W: Well most people are surprised by a lot of things and I assumed you wouldn't be. It was mostly to gauge what does turn you on...
11/30/19, 7:30 AM - Lei W: I am not trying to talk earlier in fact it is easier for me later, but didn't know what your preferences were, which is why I ask occasionally

12/1/19, 2:08 PM - Lei W: Very nice! This weekend I've been productive also cleaning van and prepping for drive to Joshua tree next weekend.  (for friends birthday camping).
12/1/19, 2:10 PM - Lei W: You might have a future star on your hands.  Either a driven career woman with a obsessive hobby or athlete that you can't help but love vicariously through as parent sometimes

12/1/19, 5:11 PM - Lei W: 👍🏻
12/1/19, 10:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I was recently at Venetian in Macao...was hoping to stay at the Palazzo at the Venetian but they have no rooms 17, 18. Are you ok if I book the Palazzo 15, 16 then at a lower key 5 star hotel NoMad on 17 and 18 for pedestal bathtub and best bar in North America?
12/1/19, 10:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 12:51 AM - Lei W: They look great. However I appreciate most like above as beautiful art and not sexual, fyi. Pics and text are both good! Which ever you feel love sharing
12/2/19, 1:08 AM - Lei W: I am happy just to spend time with you.  Camping under a bridge is just a different experience than a 5 star hotel, though I try not to spoil myself with extravagance of the latter often.  Any hotel on the strip is good as it is easier to do casino walk throughs without having to drive.  Beware there's always a 'resort fee' of $30+ per night in the final price.  The venetian has a gondola ride downstairs which is neat.  Nomad is in city center which is a great location I loved it when I stayed at Aria and Vdara.  Aria used to have a great poker room
12/2/19, 3:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I can't wait to experience camping with you, or rundown motel on the side of the highway, or sleeping under the stars with no shelter (all associated with fond memories for me). I told you even last year I stayed in $20/night and $200/night in Bali during the same trip - though I do not need luxury, I am lucky to have been spoiled (only able to enjoy it more without guilt in the past 1 yr), and I really love spoiling others. Given that Feb 15th falls during Valentine's weekend, it was a little unreasonable at some places. I have booked Park MGM, pretty much next to Aria, for 15&16, then NoMad next door for 17&18. It would be nice to compare 4 star vs 5 star next to each other and I did not spend too much ;) ... I will have to study for Economics exam so you won't have to feel bad if you have to work. Mon 17 is  holiday for me which also works out.
12/2/19, 3:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 3:58 PM - Lei W: I forgot about Valentines weekend yes that makes planning around my BD a big pain!
12/2/19, 3:58 PM - Lei W: Glad to hear the price isn't unreasonable
12/2/19, 7:31 PM - Lei W: Thank you for planning all this. Haven't stayed at mgm before looking forward to the comparison. Let's chat next regarding what shows you like and I can book some
12/3/19, 9:04 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, it would be fun to see what you are most interested in seeing...I actually don't even have a guess. You have to start first with saying what you are interested in!

12/3/19, 5:38 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Your email: yes total copout and complete avoidance of answering a question, which I was hoping to use to better get to know you. But, no big deal. So, totally not because of you, but because earlier today I looked up Cirque shows in Vegas already, I had my mind set on One because I really like Michael Jackson's songs.
12/3/19, 5:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/3/19, 5:39 PM - Lei W: Ha One was my preference, plus I talked about Chippendale!
12/3/19, 5:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And after 3 agonizing minutes and not being able to answer all minus manhood, I chose personality BUT after some more questions

12/3/19, 9:59 PM - Lei W: Good night! Yes very jealous of your nice appt. Mine is 20% more before exchange rate and window just looks at parked cars
12/4/19, 11:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Do you have time to chat tonight?
12/4/19, 11:46 AM - Lei W: Unfortunately tonight have to meet with friend at gym and going to store beforehand. You can't talk 9 to 10et can you?
12/4/19, 11:55 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I should be able to talk at 9 for 30 min walking back from dinner with friends, but then have to put kids to bed when I get home. We can just say hello. I like hearing your voice. You can tell me what your weekend is going to be like!
12/4/19, 11:57 AM - Lei W: OK I'll call you at 9 then
12/4/19, 12:03 PM - Lei W: You will get a calendar invite in email but you can ignore that for now
12/4/19, 6:13 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Sorry I can't, will explain in a swc

12/4/19, 10:44 PM - Lei W: Wonderful necklace. I would treasure it too
12/6/19, 11:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Unfortunately I actually lost it at a water park I took kids to. But I will remember the message forever, is a part of me now really. (On that note, pls never get me anyTHING even remotely expensive, I seem to find it hard to put value on physical objects and tend to lose them).
12/6/19, 11:43 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 11:56 AM - Lei W: Love these impromptu pics that show the real you!
12/6/19, 11:57 AM - Lei W: Not sure if I can comply with your request but I will keep that in mind
12/6/19, 7:17 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 7:19 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And I am trying to get her to come work for me to take one of the two Sr Pharmacist contract positions I am hiring for!

12/9/19, 1:54 AM - Lei W: Any time tomorrow after 7et would work for me.  Just got in the door, turned out to be around 24 hrs of driving in weekend not 20.  Of course your can use any of my photos. Talk tomorrow!
12/9/19, 1:55 AM - Lei W: No time to go through my photos yet but here's the first one I took after arriving in jtree thought it appropriate
12/9/19, 1:56 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 11:05 AM - Sang Mi Lee: What incredible photo this was to wake up to! I just got to go out for lunch with a friend (so incredibly rare for me to be able to do this on work day but we booked this 2 months in advance and I told my assistant it is not touchable)! I am home after 9pm et so whenever it work best for you, pls call.
12/9/19, 3:39 PM - Lei W: Might be talking to coworkers between 830 and 930 but I'll give you a 30 min heads up when I can cal

12/9/19, 6:19 PM - Lei W: Galaxy note 10 has to be my next phone now!! I'm convinced
12/9/19, 6:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good anytime

12/10/19, 12:51 AM - Lei W: Want to kiss right there 💋👉❄️
12/10/19, 12:52 AM - Lei W: Weight at same as Friday was just very hydrated
12/10/19, 12:55 AM - Lei W: You deleted this message
12/10/19, 12:59 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/10/19, 9:18 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/10/19, 9:30 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, but that is also a choice. Take her own advice When you want to do something, it's not difficult. If she ever chose to want to be proud of herself for being 2nd, if she want to choose some self compassion, she will be able to feel pride.
12/10/19, 9:32 AM - Lei W: That was ola Kurylenko who was a bond girl and runner up to Gal Gadot for wonderwoman.  I also think the lack of pride also had something to do with her success just like it does with us
12/10/19, 10:51 AM - Lei W: Also I've decided to achieve 135 weight goal as priority one regardless of excuses like being able to train hardest at the gym or maintaining run paces etc. Let's see how many days it takes!
12/10/19, 12:15 PM - Lei W: And another thought: Did I tell you today yet that I feel very lucky to have gotten to know Sang Mi Lee?
12/10/19, 12:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: One cannot say in public "I have set my goal to be first, and I know I did not try my best/ could have done x better so got second. Therefore, it would be foolish of me to be proud of myself." There is a big difference between less than ideal outcome/ failure one can be proud of and one that should bring self improvement. Besides humility is appreciated...so hard to tell what she is saying but so many different ways one could see her point of view.
12/10/19, 12:18 PM - Lei W: Acting is a very relationship dependent profession most of them are very good at only saying things that other people feel good about.  In her Q&A she basically complemented everyone hard to tell what she didn't like
12/10/19, 12:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 😘 Thank you. I think how I feel about you was very well illustrated by Anchalee saying to me today, you look a little tired but very happy and relaxed. And I smiled and said I had a wonderful conversation with Lei all evening.
12/10/19, 12:21 PM - Lei W: Hollywood Reporter: "Anything Could Have Happened": How Olga Kurylenko Lost 'Wonder Woman'.
https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/anything-could-have-happened-how-olga-kurylenko-lost-wonder-woman-1260651
12/10/19, 12:23 PM - Lei W: 💞💖💝
12/10/19, 1:57 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/10/19, 2:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, stunning.
12/10/19, 2:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So tell me how much you weigh every third day until out trip?
12/10/19, 5:20 PM - Lei W: Progress reports lol I love it.  I will have to resist trying harder and will do what I would have done before you asked
12/10/19, 5:22 PM - Lei W: As reference I was 137.6 lb this morning after waking up and peeing, having eaten a lot last night.
12/10/19, 5:32 PM - Lei W: Was 134.8 3 weeks after a run but the goal counts only the high of the day, are my rules.
12/10/19, 5:32 PM - Lei W: ^3 weeks ago
12/10/19, 8:38 PM - Sang Mi Lee: The high of the day, with or without clothes, and to the first decimal or do you round? I have never before has someone tell me their weight in lbs to the tenths before. I say up to 135.4 as a high of the day should meet your goal. I don't even own a scale and can only weigh myself at the gym...
12/10/19, 8:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/10/19, 8:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night darling
12/10/19, 8:49 PM - Lei W: I prefer the mechanical balance scales at gyms, but only have a digital one at home as I didn't want to pay $200.  The display is accurate to .1kg/.2lb supposedly.  I will aim for 135.0 as I don't want to feel I tried to fudge my own rules.  Weight is with underwear or nude before a meal but not after sweating.  Doesn't take extra effort to be accurate so might as well be precise.
12/10/19, 8:50 PM - Lei W: Good night and sweet dreams dear
12/10/19, 9:15 PM - Lei W: It was strange as I said as I didn't poop Fri night to Monday morning as I didn't eat much in jtree so it must have been water weight

12/11/19, 10:53 AM - Sang Mi Lee: She's gorgeous. Any chance you were physically with her? First photo of a model you sent where my immediate reaction was a very strong attraction, not admiration of the art/beauty alone...
12/11/19, 12:51 PM - Lei W: Ha, no.  Never interacted with any model beyond the normal professional shoot and communications.  Only twice did I even shared a post shoot meal 1v1, never tried to hit on them.  Monique (pageant girl) was only person I hung out with socially as I considered her a friend after interesting conversation post pageant that first day.
12/11/19, 12:56 PM - Lei W: Ah also forgot about Angel from first nude shoot who I ran into at ninja warrior training as wild coincidence, but doesn't change above statement

12/11/19, 4:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Of course you have to be professional during the shoot but no one said it is inappropriate to have become friends or more with someone you meet working...hmm ;)
12/11/19, 4:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Interesting how Monique was clearly sweet and unique (plus beautiful) but no attraction, yet this girl I immediately wondered how she moans with pleasure. Katya has a nice body...but again nothing really attraction wise...
12/11/19, 6:08 PM - Lei W: Yes very interesting I wonder what exactly attracted you. She doesn't stand out from the others in my view except for being on the thinner side
12/11/19, 6:10 PM - Lei W: Well yes but usually it takes one side to at least extend the collaboration or make it a common occurrence to do so.
12/11/19, 6:17 PM - Lei W: It was my boss's birthday but I didn't find out till an hour ago. Went and bought a cake.  Etiquette means I had to eat a slice doubles my calories for the day. 😳
12/11/19, 6:17 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/11/19, 7:15 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Number is cute! Making me want lychee...
12/11/19, 7:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Not the body. Kate's body is more attractive. Her eyes/look and hair is my guess.
12/11/19, 7:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Katya
12/11/19, 7:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: The style...something I cannot put my finger on
12/11/19, 7:18 PM - Lei W: Forgot how old he was, but #1 is always appropriate. 😊
12/12/19, 9:31 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Hey you, any chance you made a decision on whether you will come to NYC? No pressure (I won't be offended at all if you have to work) but we need to know for restaurant reservations. Thx
12/12/19, 9:34 AM - Lei W: Yes I will. Let me look at flights and tell you dates later today
12/12/19, 12:05 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/12/19, 12:07 PM - Lei W: Re: Email interdependence I am terrible at it.  Probably because I never understood it
12/12/19, 1:54 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am free at 11et to chat tomorrow or the day after. Thank you for coming to NYC, it would really be great to have you meet my friends.
12/12/19, 1:58 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Here is one definition from website, but what I learned from counseling is really that one must be able to feel secure in communicating one's own needs and understand the other's needs to build a relationship together than support and balance these needs together. 

Partners in an interdependent, or secure relationship, put the relationship first. Not their partner. "They live by mutually agreed-upon rules, that ultimately are good for each individual too," Bishop says. They have identities outside the relationship, but will never do anything that will hurt the relationship.
12/12/19, 1:58 PM - Lei W: Yes but it is definitely risky for me as judging SOs of close friends is inevitable and my surface traits aren't as favorable as many
12/12/19, 1:59 PM - Lei W: For example one of Lucy's close friends really dislikes me even though I've never met her, and I couldn't be bothered to care enough about friends opinion to correct any misconceptions
12/12/19, 2:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Risk of what? Losing me? Having me think of you differently?
12/12/19, 2:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You can choose not to care about my friends' opinions, that is ok. I am not wanting you to get them to like you.
12/12/19, 2:01 PM - Lei W: Risky that your friends could dislike me and could color your own opinions whether you agree or not
12/12/19, 2:02 PM - Lei W: I don't need to care about others opinions but am well aware that it affects me sometimes regardless
12/12/19, 2:03 PM - Lei W: Let's chat at 11et tomorrow Fri night?
12/12/19, 2:04 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am sharing my life with my close friends. It makes me happy to do so. Yes maybe they will get me to see you un ways I have not considered, but that will also lead us to conversations that could be interesting. Yes, talk tomorrow.
12/12/19, 2:04 PM - Lei W: 💋
12/12/19, 5:31 PM - Lei W: I know I agreed that I will update you on weight loss every 3rd day but here's info a day early. The bad news is it is unlikely to lose 1kg in 3 days given what I ate and how I exercised. So I'll have to give it a few more days to confirm
12/12/19, 5:33 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/12/19, 5:35 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/12/19, 6:56 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You can be muted in your celebration of reaching the target for as long as you like, but I am very happy for you! Now maintain it till the trip and log how you feel/ how well you climb etc.
12/12/19, 7:07 PM - Lei W: Thank you for being happy. I just realized I make excuses when I succeed and analyze when I fail, contrary to what some others do.  Should learn to give myself more credit.  Feels weird saying that
12/12/19, 7:09 PM - Lei W: Maybe I should actually eat a normal meal tonight as a reward first time since Monday
12/12/19, 7:15 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Strive for balance and objectivity in your assessment of yourself and others!
12/12/19, 7:17 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I support that (having made me and kids steak tonight)!
12/12/19, 7:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/12/19, 11:02 PM - Lei W: That sounds like a motivational poster but doesn't help me in this case.  I rather have your personal opinion on if x is too much or y is not enough.
12/12/19, 11:06 PM - Lei W: In the end I only ate half a meal but still most since Monday.  I will eat til I'm full perhaps on Sunday if I am satisfied my goal was met.
12/12/19, 11:08 PM - Lei W: Wait I thought you had already booked from 18 to 22? Are you staying with friends on the 21st?
12/13/19, 3:40 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes. I fly out 22 am but have not decided whether to stay with Megan or near airport.
12/13/19, 4:01 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I would say you should still have the thought that you may want to wait to Sun for full credit to yourself but still feel accomplished with how quickly you got to the results and not prioritize coming up with excuses.
12/13/19, 12:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 12:23 PM - Lei W: I agree with the quote but the whole time I was finding fault in the video's theme. Exceptions prove the rule unfortunately
12/13/19, 4:12 PM - Lei W: Just spent 2.5 hrs going through 'Neuropsychological testing' as part of ADD diagnosis. Some of it around memory and pattern match is almost like an IQ test. Only maxed out 2 out of 10 things maybe I'm not as smrt as I think I am!
12/13/19, 4:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I was just making dumplings and thinking of you. Not sure if you are serious or not but what's important is that you are smart enough to achieve what you want to. But if you are sad about not being the smartest man in the Bay area, can't help you there 😢😉
12/13/19, 4:37 PM - Lei W: 80% serious
12/13/19, 10:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hope you had enough time in the gym. I have been lying here hoping I could come up with a poetic prose that better describes the essence of my love for you. But I can't. It feels sober and pure, and for an atheist I find it funny that the best way to explain it is...how for the very first time in my life, you have made me feel the loves described in Corinthians. Of course, intellectually I could appreciate it before but honestly...despite loving my kids...until you, within me I was not capable of feeling love this way.

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
12/13/19, 10:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So my poetic rather cheesy prose: "In loving you, I have found the true meaning of love. And I could have never known the beauty of loving this way without you."
12/14/19, 9:58 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/14/19, 11:00 AM - Lei W: I don't! Good to have.
12/14/19, 11:02 AM - Lei W: Cheesy isn't, when it is appropriate.  Thank you for that.  Had decent time in the gym, going again today anyway, training for something different. How your weekend is productive!

12/14/19, 7:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I remember dancing around the room when you were taking those photos of me, and I realized that I had never before let anyone take a nude photo of me. For a girl who has been on many beaches topless and gone skinny diving more than once, it seems rather shocking to me that I had not let that happen before...I think I am inadvertently stroking your ego with you being my first for yet another thing ;)
12/15/19, 12:56 AM - Lei W: And I feel very privileged to have been the special one.  Didn't even realize it at the time given how uninhibited a personality you seem to have.
12/15/19, 12:59 AM - Lei W: Bought another toy today. No not that kind of toy. But I will bring it with me in NGA
12/15/19, 1:39 PM - Lei W: So it is possible I didn't really hit my 135 lb goal.  Even being very specific in the definition. Might have to go another week to be sure.  Looking forward to testing my discipline.
12/15/19, 2:06 PM - Sang Mi Lee: What was the weight today? Also, I can talk at 11 any day starting tonight till we go away (ie whenever you are free at that time) but I need your help in getting me off the phone at midnight whenever we talk (so I don't wear myself down before our time together as I try to get a lot done at work while going out for holiday stuff in the evenings as well).
12/15/19, 2:10 PM - Lei W: It's not the weight(135.6) but the fluctuations that invalidate. Call you tonight at 11? Of course 👍 on the midnight cutoff
12/15/19, 2:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Talk soon!

12/15/19, 9:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I love you.

12/16/19, 7:19 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Well good morning handsome! I was wondering what you looked like in formal wear (seriously). I was just told to expect invitations to 1) closing plenary panel at the biggest and most important conference in Canada in my field and 2) panel at international conference ISPOR in Orlando where I would be able to have a lot of exposure to American payors and policymakers! (And an even better feeling than these invitations, that immediately I thougt of sharing my excitement with you, and remembered that I only shared my frustrations at work the other day with you.)
12/16/19, 4:55 PM - Lei W: Wonderful to hear about those invitations! For work well done, congrats.  Sorry I was in a hurry this morning and forgot my phone at home and wasn't able to reply til now.
12/16/19, 4:57 PM - Lei W: Also as have mentioned before I like hearing about frustrations as much or more than excitements, because it is more of a privilege for the listener.
12/16/19, 4:59 PM - Lei W: Some bad news for my company this afternoon (but does not impact me).  Could be used to my advantage.  My primary decision today is how much to eat for dinner... Such a 1st world problem.
12/16/19, 5:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Np on timing of response, love how you can contextualize issues objectively. Spent an hour following up on executing the plan on the problematic file today and have a meeting set up tomorrow to hopefully bring it home, fingers crossed.

12/16/19, 8:42 PM - Sang Mi Lee: https://amp-businessinsider-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.businessinsider.com/aristotles-timeless-advice-on-what-friendship-is-and-why-it-matters-2017-12?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D#aoh=15765573048588&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Faristotles-timeless-advice-on-what-friendship-is-and-why-it-matters-2017-12
12/16/19, 9:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I find some of your life rather intriguing in its difference from mine...our discussion yesterday on friendship made me ponder its significance. I really like Aristotle's clear definition of different types of friends. In fact, not at all different from relationships. There have proven ppl end up attracted to ppl they spend a lot of time with or for exchange of benefits/ utility as I was saying the other night. So on your point on you not getting enough value from friendships...all I am is a true friend who is physically attracted to you, so if you are getting value from me (and I know you are not with me for the sex), then the bottom line is you just don't have valuable friends. If we don't work out, your next girlfriend is going to have to deal with me being the one of 2 closest friends for life and only one in the same continent. I am not kidding.
12/16/19, 10:27 PM - Lei W: Just because sex isn't #1 on my list doesn't mean it isn't a required part of a relationship. As for value /utility I haven't fully talked about what I usually need yet, though I talked about the highlights.
12/16/19, 10:27 PM - Lei W: Just came back from a good gym session where I cheated a bit on my diet pre workout for a better workout

12/17/19, 12:10 PM - Lei W: The eng/MD CTO's brother founded one of the bigger yoga camps and was a hedge fund manager. Successful family
12/17/19, 12:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I DID IT! 5 HRS dealing with all stakeholders involved today and landed the deal
12/17/19, 12:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes you told me about her, she seems fun and lovely
12/17/19, 12:13 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I will certainly be having a bubbly tonight with friends over dinner. I have eaten nothing all day with this issue and now headed to a meeting for 2 hrs with consultants I hired before I get to properly unwind and celebrate...bonus I guess is everyone recognized how I resolved the problem and brought it to successful outcome.
12/17/19, 12:15 PM - Lei W: And she 'wears the pants' in the relationship which I might have also mentioned. But is a normal girl in everyday life which is great.
12/17/19, 12:16 PM - Lei W: Recognition!! So happy to hear that.  Congrats again and enjoy the deserved drinks!!
12/17/19, 12:18 PM - Lei W: 🥇🏆👠💪🏼
12/17/19, 12:24 PM - Lei W: About your success... Something about my subconscious appreciation for capable women... Must be significant but not much conscious awareness, puzzling
12/17/19, 7:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You are more social with alcohol, I am social enough without but certainly causes increased sex drive...though most of dinner talk was re: navigating difficult work relationships and career plans, currently just got home and in bed fantasizing about you and the way your toned body feels on my fingertips, your damn sexy derriere, and your sweet lips...
12/18/19, 2:13 AM - Lei W: And then you fell asleep... Lucid dreaming, I might give that a try next year...

12/18/19, 6:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I am free...but fyi, I got your ticket and you do not fly until Sun.

12/18/19, 6:22 PM - Lei W: Oops mistype I meant Sunday
12/18/19, 6:23 PM - Lei W: Which means I can also talk Fri night. Sat night at the movies.
12/18/19, 6:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Np. Just making sure you have right info. Call me when you have time, I already confirmed I am free at 11 :)
12/18/19, 6:28 PM - Lei W: 👍Call you tomorrow night at 11

12/19/19, 2:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: What's your weight today?
12/19/19, 3:09 PM - Lei W: Back to 8 days ago. 136.8 morning.  Been eating normally for 3 days in prep for trip
12/19/19, 3:09 PM - Lei W: Normal 1 meal a day

12/20/19, 12:11 AM - Lei W: 🔥🌬️❄️
12/20/19, 12:27 PM - Lei W: Call this morning went well but could have exceeded their expectations if I had done what I was thinking of last night.  Actually got a little bit of feedback from user pov(though not from real future user) so that was useful
12/20/19, 1:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So glad you wrote me about this as I was going to ask 1) if you got the program working and 2) regardless of #1 how the call went. Definitely a better day than one I had given I had to cancel both lunch date and office game afternoon by getting pulled into emergency meetings. Have fun tonight! 💋🤗
12/20/19, 1:20 PM - Lei W: Decided not to get it done last night as it would have been a hack job with that short a time frame. Will take a day or two to do it properly instead of hastily
12/20/19, 6:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 6:39 PM - Lei W: My own superhero identity is "Cold Water Man" because it's one of the only things I'm afraid of

12/21/19, 2:49 PM - Lei W: You look great, love the photo too.  About to go to the gym one last time then a movie before I pack and try to get a few hrs of sleep. Can't wait!
12/21/19, 3:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I just had dinner with a friend and also off to climb since it will be my only chance before the end of this year! 😘

12/21/19, 3:32 PM - Lei W: Didn't change it from default as I didn't know if you preselected
12/21/19, 4:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ok, I got upgraded to business on tomorrow's flights so whoever's is next to you should be happy to sit in 3C and we can sit together.

12/22/19, 4:03 AM - Lei W: Apparently the '2 hours before flight' rule can't always apply.  It is 4:02am 1:43 before departure and SFO security isn't even open yet
12/22/19, 4:03 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 4:04 AM - Lei W: I'd have thought they would have 24 hour flights
12/22/19, 4:06 AM - Lei W: Like the color
12/22/19, 5:07 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Wow...and it is one of the busiest travel season..
12/22/19, 5:12 AM - Lei W: Just sat down at gate if I had gotten to airport the minute security opened I'd be only 20 min before flight.  Strange
12/22/19, 5:14 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Interesting operational management question. I am fascinated...I have gone through security at 4am in many airports. Hope you can sleep on flight!
12/22/19, 5:16 AM - Lei W: For 1 sleep cycle (1:10am to 2:42) I'm surprisingly fresh.  But will try to sleep
12/22/19, 5:19 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, and we will get to bed early tonight too. ❤ safe flight!

12/22/19, 8:27 AM - Lei W: Great at both functions?
12/22/19, 8:29 AM - Lei W: Bad news flight was canceled after 2 hrs on the tarmac mechanical problem or something. People lined up at the Avianca counter waiting to find out what they can do. Will update you when I have more info
12/22/19, 8:33 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh no! Ok
12/22/19, 8:42 AM - Lei W: When is your flight to Sal?
12/22/19, 8:48 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 3:10. Let me know though what is going on because I care less about the trip vs spending time with you
12/22/19, 8:49 AM - Lei W: It's been 30 minutes and it doesn't look like any passengers have been successful rebooked yet.  This is going to be a clusterflower methinks
12/22/19, 8:50 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes at this time of the year especially it is going to be insane. I had to get on a school project call at 1pm so wanted to be through customs so am on my way to airport. Can I call you in 20min and we talk of options?
12/22/19, 8:50 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 8:51 AM - Lei W: Yes I'll be in line call any time

12/22/19, 10:11 AM - Lei W: Oakland temp 5-12c.  Coldest place we will go is -7 to 4. (Tahoe, yosemite) Though we don't have to go to the scenic places in the mountains.  Along the coast we can drive down similar temp to Oakland
12/22/19, 10:41 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 10:44 AM - Lei W: We can decide what to do/when/where once you get here.  As long as you have hiking shoes and warm clothes
12/22/19, 10:54 AM - Lei W: I'm almost at the front of the line to ask what they can do for compensation in addition to refunding your ticket
12/22/19, 10:55 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yup, realistically it will be hard/ expensive to stay anywhere...tho maybe we can sleep in your van. I can cook us some lovely dinners...I miss cooking good non kid food.
12/22/19, 10:58 AM - Lei W: Hotel is cheap don't need to stay in van unless we are going somewhere without hotels. Though van isn't that bad even with low Temps.
12/22/19, 10:59 AM - Lei W: As I said my place is available after 24th
12/22/19, 11:10 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I know, I meant we don't necessarily have to make any big trips to places that are in demand for holidays. Thx for the hotel!
12/22/19, 11:13 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Ok, back home, sorry you had to wake up so early - hopefully you can go and have a nap soon. And also you could go into work tomorrow if you want...we'll chat later today
12/22/19, 11:15 AM - Lei W: All I am doing is standing around.  Compared to you or the other people I talked to in line I have little to complain about.
12/22/19, 11:46 AM - Lei W: Almost 4 hrs in line to be told... 'We don't do refunds or compensation you will have to call to do that'.   But got a $10 Wendy's food voucher hurray!!! I feel obligated to use it to justify my time.  Sunk cost, right? 🤔
12/22/19, 12:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Go and eat and unwind.
12/22/19, 12:03 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yosemite in winter would be beautiful...
12/22/19, 12:09 PM - Lei W: Just need to avoid freezing my toe this time
12/22/19, 12:09 PM - Lei W: Or maybe freeze left one for equilibrium
12/22/19, 1:00 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 1:44 PM - Lei W: Back home. Going to try taking a nap.  Sorry that this screwed your well planned sunny beach vacation I was really looking forward to it too. 😕Can I hug it all better tonight?
12/22/19, 1:47 PM - Lei W: I am picking you up at sfo at 950 and dropping you off somewhere and picking you up later? Or just later after you are done? Let me know
12/22/19, 4:06 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I had a 20 page group paper due today - without this today would have been smoother. I have given my final review of the paper and boarded the flight. Winnie used to say to me things happen for a reason and if anything, I should take this opportunity as luxury to slow down...I had originally booked the hotel mid Aug knowing by Dec I would be spent, that I would have pushed myself to exhaustion. It was in a way giving myself the motivation and reward...basically permission to push myself more than I should. In a way, I have actually been better at taking care of myself than I thought I would be, but I am very tired. It was very easy to choose spending time with you over fun (I would have still had fun alone). After all, the other night when my friend asked if I was excited, I said I was excited to spend Christmas with someone I love.
12/22/19, 4:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My only request, I want to skate on Christmas eve.
12/22/19, 10:00 PM - Lei W: In terminal where you came out last time
12/22/19, 10:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Apparently 10 min for a gate
12/22/19, 10:06 PM - Lei W: At least air canada communicates status well
12/22/19, 10:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My friend and I decided to cancel because we are both exhausted...I had a ridiculously productive flight but that also means my eyes are super tired and blurry...
12/22/19, 10:11 PM - Lei W: Bed and soft sheets are calling, and I can deliver you
12/22/19, 10:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I really need a glass of wine...then bed.
12/22/19, 10:27 PM - Lei W: We'll make that happen
12/22/19, 10:32 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You must really be sick of this airport right now! Got to the gate.
12/22/19, 10:32 PM - Lei W: Its not the airport's fault poor thing
12/22/19, 10:34 PM - Lei W: Just makes me appreciate when things happen as expected

12/23/19, 4:41 PM - Lei W: We can try tomorrow

12/27/19, 11:24 PM - Lei W: 💝💓
12/28/19, 5:12 AM - Sang Mi Lee: At my place. Slept most of flight but will have a couple of hours of nap before tackling the day
12/28/19, 5:29 AM - Lei W: Bad news. Someone just broke into my apartment while I was sleeping.  Ran when I woke up but stole my keys and 2 of my cars including the van
12/28/19, 5:30 AM - Lei W: Just 20 min before your text
12/28/19, 6:01 AM - Lei W: Hope you napped well! Don't worry about me cars are insured and I'm safe.  Burglar didn't have time to take too much stuff just my work laptop by the door. Still have my wallet and other laptops and phone.  You have a good time with friends and I'll tell you more later as I'm sure you are curious
12/28/19, 7:39 AM - Sang Mi Lee: What?!? Oh my gosh...unreal...planned? Guess you know how police deals with these burglaries given your past experience. I'm so sorry...I don't have to be out till noon. Hope you did not have too much stuff in the cars...
12/28/19, 10:11 AM - Lei W: It's possible they find the property. In Evans case they found the guy but not his laptop or phone.  Cars are harder to hide especially the van but they could strip for parts.  Given they had time to drive my vehicles out before I woke up it is likely more than 1 person. Organization means possible chop shop.
12/28/19, 10:14 AM - Lei W: But now my plan to work this weekend is shot.  This is the second woke laptop stolen in a few months. Someone stole Daniel's work laptop by breaking windows of his suv 4 months ago
12/28/19, 10:15 AM - Lei W: Lots of misc stuff in the van but past 6 months of photos was on a portable drive and they took that. Glad I at least uploaded album last night of this week.
12/28/19, 10:37 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I'm so sorry this happened. I have never had anything stolen in Toronto and the worst my friends have had happen is stuff stolen from parked car. I don't even sometimes lock my door at night! So I had a little shock reaction to what you wrote and thought that it would be so annoying to have to deal with all the reporting and insurance and such instead of getting your work done...and nothing I can do to help :(
12/28/19, 10:44 AM - Sang Mi Lee: So thankful you are fine, especially if it was organized and multiple ppl...
12/28/19, 12:43 PM - Lei W: Yes this is definitive proof that Oakland is unsafe, and somewhere like Toronto is.  I am like you that I sometimes don't lock door, only car doors.  I am more annoyed than anything.  First thought was work second was all the outdoor gear and battery electrical gadgets I had in my van.
12/28/19, 12:44 PM - Lei W: Also maybe I should have tried to chase him down in my underwear but putting on glasses would have delayed and it probably wouldn't have been possible.. Shoes cloths glasses rtc
12/28/19, 12:45 PM - Lei W: Also my thoughts were slower waking up from sleep
12/28/19, 12:45 PM - Lei W: So maybe not as good under pressure as I should have been?
12/28/19, 12:45 PM - Lei W: Had only a few seconds to assess the situation
12/28/19, 1:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: On the other hand, facing an intruder as you are waking up with nothing to protect yourself could have resulted in more significant consequences...

12/28/19, 1:53 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I now understand why Americans have guns in their houses...hmm...
12/28/19, 2:23 PM - Lei W: I made Lucy buy a gun but it is by her nightstand.  We talked about going to a shooting range but it wasn't bad going to gym instead yesterday.
12/28/19, 2:26 PM - Lei W: Yes I know well the risk of going after people but getting shot, let alone killed, is very unlikely and I will still prefer a slightly increased chance of recovering my property over increased personal danger.
12/28/19, 2:31 PM - Lei W: I also have crowbar and heavy objects nearby unless he had a knife or gun I would more likely win the confrontation.  Another missed opportunity to test it out
12/28/19, 3:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I would agree, and they would most likely underestimate your strength.
12/28/19, 4:23 PM - Lei W: Well yes but most of that is irrelevant. Burglars have a lot to lose and very little to gain in confrontation. Unless on certain drugs with a particular mindset the only thought is to run.  By the time I saw what was missing its also too late for me to think about chasing.  My instinct was protect my home and assess damage by evaluation, just forgot about the parked cars and think they may have had time to make use of the keys.
12/28/19, 4:27 PM - Lei W: They also rifled through Lucy's Honda but didn't have time to drive away with it had to keep an eye on it til I got it towed to dealer to invalidate remote entry fob.  Unlucky that Lucy bought it used with only the 1 key that was stolen. If police don't find anything Lucy is out only 500 for key replacements and I'm down 7-10k with gear and insurance deductibles which is still 1/5 of the van fire fiasco from 2016
12/28/19, 4:31 PM - Lei W: It's just money but still sad that I lost a lot of photos from this past year from the mini SSD plugged into work laptop.  And the Wacom tablet that was the only thing in backpack stolen along with my Canadian passport and US green card
12/28/19, 4:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And so much time to deal withevwrything too! Do you have a few min to chat any time today?
12/28/19, 4:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Photos especially! Wish I could help you clean up
12/28/19, 4:56 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/28/19, 4:56 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/28/19, 4:56 PM - Lei W: I can chat any time.  Now or later you tell me when
12/28/19, 4:56 PM - Lei W: Sending photos to police
12/28/19, 4:58 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Will call you in 2 min!
12/28/19, 9:11 PM - Lei W: Only 3 things left in car. A small bottle of lotion, pair of socks, And the national parks pass I bought in yosemite 3 days ago
12/28/19, 9:11 PM - Lei W: And something else funny will send you Pic tomorrow
12/29/19, 7:51 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 8:04 AM - Lei W: And you know that almost anyone could have taken a good photo at sunset there! Plus some simple adjustments and the right crop.
12/29/19, 8:11 AM - Lei W: They just found my van a few hundred meters from my apartment.  (Mazda was 2 km away).  Tossed and most things  are gone but they didn't take the bed or shelving so it's as good a condition as I could hope for.
12/29/19, 8:11 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 8:11 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 👍👏👏

12/29/19, 8:13 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I have sentimental attachment to this van and bed :)
12/29/19, 8:17 AM - Lei W: Good! Even a tiny bit of sentiment meant something!
12/29/19, 8:19 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 8:21 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Easy, based on colour and letter I say ibuprofen 200mg
12/29/19, 8:21 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I will google now and see if I am right
12/29/19, 8:21 AM - Lei W: I think you are!
12/29/19, 8:22 AM - Lei W: It must have been mine now the memory is vague but combined with your hint
12/29/19, 8:23 AM - Lei W: So you are a pharmacist. You probably didn't fake your resume.. 😏
12/29/19, 8:29 AM - Sang Mi Lee: So glad things turned out better than expected! J also gave me the 50k cheque so we are both having a good start to our days! Off I go swimming with kidsos
12/29/19, 8:30 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Actually I am no longer a practicing pharmacist...I can work in hospital and other places as a pharmacist but not in retail dispensing as I gave that up
12/29/19, 8:30 AM - Lei W: A great match! His mixed features going to be cute for a lot of girls I think
12/29/19, 8:32 AM - Lei W: Awesome! Have fun!
12/29/19, 8:33 AM - Lei W: OK... 'were' a pharmacist.  Law abiding bureaucratic lady.
12/29/19, 11:31 AM - Sang Mi Lee: As kids were having lunch just now I had a friend's message remind me of the goals I jotted down...which led me to look at it and though it has only been a week, I made edits from me becoming a more confident, brave person. I can share more on it later, but one example is, I have always had love for Russian culture, art and literature and wanted to visit Moscow and St. Petersburg but never before thought I would be strong enough to do Elbrus and it would take too much effort to train. But you saying I can do Rainier now made me realize I can do Elbrus. So whenever I do get to Russia, I will definitely do something like this https://www.rmiguides.com/mt-elbrus-southside
12/29/19, 11:32 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you, love 😘
12/29/19, 8:03 PM - Lei W: Elbrus is 2x harder than Rainier from big summit day elevation but training is relatively straight forward.  You have enough cardio already, just need to do big hikes half a dozen times to build your legs.  We can do it without a guide you and me but if you go solo the cost of a local guide is low (1k?)
12/29/19, 8:04 PM - Lei W: You have still a few days if you want to do any goal adjustments! I'll send you a bullet point list early this week of my own.
12/29/19, 8:07 PM - Lei W: Perhaps shopping less is good.  Couldn't resist a few k $ this weekend much of it climbing gear to replace some lost items.  <$100 spent on non replacement items
12/29/19, 8:10 PM - Lei W: One piece of luck I thought my spare van key was also in the van turned out it was in a pocket of a jacket that I wore to Jtree and forgot to hang up by the door.  That saved me $400 in key cutting for now at a slight risk not to invalidate the stolen key.  Overall I lost most of this weekends work time but I will try to let it go
12/29/19, 8:21 PM - Sang Mi Lee: In whatever way we do it (that part of Russia not the safest), it would be great to put it on *our* adventure list.
12/29/19, 8:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Can you send me a link of a harness I can buy for myself? Btw, I am not going to let you pay for anything in NYC, and you need to pack a suit jacket for dinner here on 18th: https://rivercafe.com/
12/29/19, 8:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Nothing you can do when life throws you an unexpected curve ball but just roll with it ;)
12/29/19, 8:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: On Sun or Mon: https://fitt.co/new-york-city/articles/indoor-rock-climbing-gyms-nyc
12/29/19, 8:40 PM - Lei W: https://gearjunkie.com/best-climbing-harness-women I sort of agree with their recommendations, which is the BD Momentum for $57 USD  though the extra $23 for the Luna's bathroom break convenience may be worth it for you.  Check MEC there may be sales. Comfort is most important for you, also possibly compactness for travel packing
12/29/19, 8:55 PM - Lei W: Though I was shaking my head... $160 for a harness?! I guess lots of yuppies with $ in the sport now driving up prices. There is probably a $2000 gold iPhone harness with glitter for sale.  The latest reel rock 14 has a section on 'rich climbers' which was almost satire.  BTW it's playing Jan 9 in Mississauga
12/29/19, 9:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 9:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 9:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: For $50 cdn difference given first one on sale...just get that?
12/29/19, 9:02 PM - Lei W: Hmm due to the price I didn't even consider it for a first harness but give me a min let me look at the specs
12/29/19, 9:12 PM - Lei W: If you become a semi regular climber the arcteryx is worth it.  Much lighter and sleeker. I don't know about comfort but it says it's got lots of tech so maybe I believe it.  Climbing gear is unreturnable (liability) so if you have time you should try it in store to be sure.  You are XS of course
12/29/19, 9:13 PM - Lei W: (they may take your return but the store won't be able to sell it again)
12/29/19, 9:15 PM - Lei W: I'll have you know I've owned 7 or 8 harnesses and never paid more than $50.. 🙄 But I'm cheap
12/29/19, 9:17 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Can I call you for 5 min. I am ready for bed tired of typing!! :)
12/29/19, 9:17 PM - Lei W: Yep!
12/29/19, 10:47 PM - Lei W: BTW the Luna, grigri and belay device if bought separately in USD *1.31 exchange rate is 275. So 240 is sort of a 13% discount for the combo
12/30/19, 1:21 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 1:23 PM - Lei W: After I scraped the melted plastic off the grigri it was in perfect working condition was using it continously (the one we used) until lost this weekend. Engineered really really well
12/30/19, 3:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good to know! I took kids swimming again after work and measured Mia as they have scale with height measure there. She is just under 45 inches and 43lbs which according to CDC chart puts her at pretty much exactly 50th percentile  for both (so I guess not at all skinny for her height though she looks it). I was totally you though and did not go into water...it was a tiring day being brave on HR front and jumping into cold water did not seem pleasant when kids were already having so much fun with each other.
12/30/19, 3:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: On a more cheerful note, ex decided to finally answer all the questions related to sorting out kids' breaks so that I can plan camps and such (if I don't book the good camps early Jan they book out)...so...I am kids free all of Jul. You told me you got 2 tickets to Comicon. Not sure if I can invite myself but I can ask and you can say no, right? If we are planning future adventures together, 7 months planning ahead doesn't seem inappropriate. ❤
12/30/19, 4:35 PM - Lei W: Yes you can invite yourself and SDCC will be a lot of fun in that case. Glad to hear about your ex! Two big things this weekend right after you got rid of your fear. It won't be so correlated /effective next time but it is positive reinforcement for both of you.
12/30/19, 4:37 PM - Lei W: Cold water... Those who know their talents dont need to prove it all the time!
12/30/19, 8:20 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Can I be a slutty anime princess?
12/30/19, 8:21 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 8:47 PM - Lei W: That's really slutty
12/30/19, 8:49 PM - Lei W: Sailor moon or something similar. Yes you'll fit in and be pestered for photos
12/30/19, 8:50 PM - Lei W: It's usually hot outside feels like 30-35 and cooler inside with ac
12/30/19, 9:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night! Hope you had a more uneventful day. 💞

12/31/19, 4:42 PM - Lei W: I was going to shop at home depot.  Everyone else left the office before noon.  But a remote person just asked for something to be done 'by tonight' and it's not an easy thing. I replied a bit sternly
12/31/19, 4:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Wow, who asks for something done on NYE?
12/31/19, 4:43 PM - Lei W: Wine and sour patch that's a great dinner combo I'm jealous
12/31/19, 4:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Life and death?
12/31/19, 4:43 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have worked New Year's eve at a pharmacy as well as hospital
12/31/19, 4:44 PM - Lei W: No some language change on website... 😑
12/31/19, 4:44 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Haha, ppl have different views on urgency
12/31/19, 4:44 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Let me know if you can talk after midnight my time
12/31/19, 4:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Mia said you are very nice to Google after answering her question and Google says feeling is mutual. Thanks so much for the gift.
12/31/19, 4:46 PM - Lei W: Supposedly it is meant to be done by end of year.... I told him  one hour before end of business day on a holiday eve isnt the best etiquette
12/31/19, 4:47 PM - Lei W: Great to hear it set up and she likes it! Have to go pick up car from repair talk later tonight?
12/31/19, 4:47 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Mia: "hey google, how old are you?" Google "If you are asking if I had work done, I will have you know these are my original features"
12/31/19, 4:48 PM - Lei W: Lol.  I can talk 9pm or later just text me when you are free
12/31/19, 4:48 PM - Sang Mi Lee: K, text me later to let me know what time works for you.
12/31/19, 4:48 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Jinx
12/31/19, 4:48 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ok
12/31/19, 4:48 PM - Lei W: I can talk earlier too but you said midnight. Anytime after 10et
12/31/19, 7:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Call me at 11 then or any time after?

12/31/19, 10:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Professional: position (executive or similar) accepted by the end of the year that gives me the current flexibility but allows me to utilize more of the skills I learned through the MBA, specifically around organizational changes and business strategy development, and requires travel; ensure succession planning and development of my staff

Motherhood: more conversations about responsibility, accountability, and self regulation in addition to providing them with love and security to be themselves and discover themselves with concrete measurement of success of Jamie being less worried about upsetting me and Mia not leveraging upsetting me to get what she wants; make up for the less attention I gave them due to MBA in May-summer by spending more activity time with them fully engaged

Personal: Continue to include regular exercise into my life (climbing, gym, etc.,); continue to make same amount of time with friends but reach out to RL more; eat more vegetables and fruits; start painting/ creating art again once MBA is done, and take at least one AGO course in the summer or fall.

Travel/ Adventure: at least one of China, Russia, Jordan; tandem sky diving

Relationship: stop being afraid/ be less afraid of the depth of my feelings; learn to fight/ argue

Stretch goals:
- Do a proper push up and a pull up
- Get kids to clean up well at the end of every day

1/1/20, 1:51 PM - Lei W: I don't think that's what it said. I think it assumes that women react to status equally whether man is attractive or not, but men differently
1/1/20, 1:53 PM - Lei W: So moral is if male, get status and you get more girls. If female, know that if unattractive, high status will decrease attractiveness further to a lot of men
1/1/20, 1:55 PM - Lei W: One interesting comment from the reddit thread is a theory that men are more intimidated by capable ugly women because they know they didn't use looks and had real talent to get there, hot girls may have used looks so may have had less talent/discipline /smarts.
1/1/20, 3:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I get that status did not make anyone less attractive for women  but am actually surprised that there would not be a difference still, i.e. much smaller reaction to status for highly attractive ppl vs. attraction going up proportionally higher for moderately attractive ppl. And very different reaction to other women vs men (I find women at times very jealous and cruel to each other).

1/1/20, 9:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night
1/1/20, 9:10 PM - Lei W: Sure? I'm not, but good night! My previous message was sarcasm
1/2/20, 12:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 12:41 PM - Lei W: Funny... Because I was reprinting my own version today...
1/2/20, 12:41 PM - Lei W: We will compare
1/2/20, 12:58 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You can hopefully at least appreciate the thought...I tried (despite I didn't take the effort to actually recreate it as was, the laziness that in a funny way benefited I guess since you now have two different designs)
1/2/20, 1:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And by that I mean I cannot tell at all if your reaction is positive or feel bad that I did something unnecessary
1/2/20, 1:11 PM - Lei W: I really appreciate the thought! Especially when I didn't expect anything at all
1/2/20, 1:11 PM - Lei W: Sorry I didn't elaborate as I was in the middle of something
1/2/20, 1:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I know. I do. But just commenting. It is better not to respond at all then that response and if I didn't know you I would be upset ;)
1/2/20, 1:12 PM - Lei W: But it is important that the lack of appreciation in words is known, that's what I like to hear
1/2/20, 1:14 PM - Lei W: Yes better great response than halfway acknowledged . 😁
1/2/20, 2:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: In fact a regular quick response would be a "Thank you" or similar one word that guarantees the other person feeling good then you can take days to say whatever else. And I assume you would have done so if it was someone you knew less well. Off to escape room for Richard's belated bday celebration. Glad ppl voted the place without any real person as part of experience. Have a good late aft/ eve!
1/2/20, 7:11 PM - Lei W: Hope everyone escaped with no  issues and had fun in the process. Always been wanting to do one but never got to it.  Off to gym for a few hours good night!
1/2/20, 7:20 PM - Sang Mi Lee: We made very good time and used no clues, staff were impressed. Had been 2 yrs since I last did one, but it is very fun! One day you can come visit and we can do one together with my friends  :)

Going to bed (with Mia snoring next to me after turning down my 41 yr old married ex boss and friend who I saw after escape riom...he was very drunk the poor guy, who will certainly wake up embarrassed as he is a good friend and a sweet man/ husband/ father). Thinking of you 😘
1/2/20, 11:10 PM - Lei W: Yes poor guy hopefully he didn't try too directly which will be worse.  Glad to hear you are thinking of me, hugs!
1/2/20, 11:11 PM - Lei W: Felt a bit weak today at the gym but pushed a bit harder, will try to keep it up
1/2/20, 11:13 PM - Lei W: Well I actually felt guilty I put so many more fitness related goals compared to the others... But yes hopefully good for me
1/3/20, 4:11 PM - Lei W: Want to try making that lava cake myself.  Just Google chocolate lava cake recipe right? You didn't do anything different? My blender attachment just got here
1/3/20, 4:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, I did not do anything different! Send me a selfie of you while baking, I am sure I will find it sexy!
1/3/20, 4:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am at my parents' for the weekend. Maybe we can chat Sun night? Or tomorrow  am for a short time when you get up?
1/3/20, 4:28 PM - Lei W: Darn it that screws up my plans. Was going to outsource the baking and cheat like Asians do... 😎 But fine I'll learn myself.  Pick : tomorrow at 1pm ET or sun night at usual time
1/3/20, 4:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You can just pose with the tools for a second and pretend you did it ;) - Can I chat with you tomorrow just quickly, just to ask one question, then we can talk 11-12 et on Sun?
1/3/20, 6:39 PM - Lei W: Yes call me anytime
1/3/20, 6:39 PM - Lei W: I don't mind being woken up even! From you anyway
1/3/20, 6:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I would never unless it was an emergency (like I was dying)...BUT...I don't think I have ever felt more loved in my life (given the context and that it's coming from you). Thank you. Tty at 1pm et tomorrow!
1/3/20, 6:52 PM - Lei W: 💓💋

1/4/20, 11:05 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, I would have tried another method if we weren't scheduled to chat tomorrow! I am writing a painfully massive implementation plan for school while my family entertains my children. Have a good weekend! (And actually I may go to Iqaluit after all, over Easter with the kids ... waiting to see what John thinks about how my kids will do up there)
1/4/20, 4:54 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/4/20, 5:00 PM - Lei W: It's not quite complete but around 90% capable.  There is extras but 60%of it is needed for traditional climbing and 50% for sports climbing.
1/4/20, 5:02 PM - Lei W: Bouldering indoors is the simplest, just shoes and chalk.
1/4/20, 6:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Nice! I am actually going to go to MEC and get the gear on Wed after a late meeting if I manage to get all my needed school work and work done by then as a little treat for myself.

1/5/20, 12:22 PM - Lei W: Which restaurant in NYC had the dress code?
1/5/20, 12:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: River Cafe
1/5/20, 12:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Definitely sexy...mmm

1/6/20, 6:54 PM - Lei W: Just wanted to say how wonderful a person you are and how happy I am at getting to know you. Hope you had a great day! 🌹
1/6/20, 7:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thank you darling! As much as I like a beautiful 5 star luxury hotel by the beach, I would not be any happier there with you than I would be in your arms on the mattress inside your van. 🥰
1/7/20, 9:18 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/7/20, 12:54 PM - Lei W: You look really young with that cut. Maybe the edginess.  I like it.  That you have so many looks
1/7/20, 12:55 PM - Lei W: And luckily the van and mattress and sheets and pillows are still with me.  Otherwise I'd be in trouble!  I should take out sangmi mattress insurance.
1/7/20, 8:15 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Universe knew what was important ❤. I had dinner with MBA girlfriends then came home at 10, but since I didn't have kids for first time since I came back from CA, I exercised for the first time since little bouldering on NYE. I did some squats with 40lb weight on shoulder...was hard but fine. I noticed I can do knee pushups much easier than I ever have in my life!
1/7/20, 9:33 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh and let me know how your work deliverable for SD meeting is going. Hopefully well. Love you, good night!
1/8/20, 1:01 AM - Lei W: Let me know if your butt is sore this morning!  My deliverable reqs are low and I did not raise expectations so should be fine though I am trying to add a few things for demo next Thursday.
1/8/20, 1:05 AM - Lei W: Had a almost great session myself at the gym.  Tried to do 20 v5 or harder did 18 v5 to v7 but failed 5 times on last move of 2 more til a finger tip started bleeding had to stop.  Still was the most volume I'd done in years maybe decade felt good mentally.  Just have to avoid tendon injury if training hard.
1/8/20, 7:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am not sore though I feel it. I am really not good at pushing myself physically without external motivation like class/ instructor. I am probably a good candidate for a personal trainer...I will do more today with goal of feeling sore tomorrow and see how it goes :)
1/8/20, 8:41 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/8/20, 9:16 AM - Lei W: My 2019 summary is low only 1.2 around the world but 2018 was 2 times(two trips to Asia).  However I have consistently spent 600+ hours in a vehicle per year last few years part of an American lifestyle
1/8/20, 9:19 AM - Lei W: Yes you would be.  It is always easier to push even with a workout partner, and that's my role usually.  Though I am good at pushing solo, I know the elite athletes are great at self torture
1/8/20, 9:20 AM - Lei W: For you pushing mentally is perhaps easier than physical discomforts
1/8/20, 11:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 282 hrs in a vehicle for me.
1/8/20, 11:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I enjoy different forms of self torture...
1/8/20, 11:22 AM - Lei W: Enjoy... Torture... Well matched words
1/8/20, 11:27 AM - Lei W: Call this morning had new people who had little idea of project seems a rotating roster of people who are involved.  Would be frustrating if I needed info from more of them
1/8/20, 12:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Frustrating but certainly a unit or project oversight team with constant turnover = either whatever you deliver would be amazing (since no one has any idea what is happening or needed) orif they don't like it you have perfect excuse (they failed in giving you proper instructions)
1/8/20, 4:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/8/20, 4:39 PM - Lei W: Sure I can talk tonight or tomorrow.  How about tonight usual time?
1/8/20, 4:40 PM - Lei W: Looks delicious I bought takeout but have to wait 2 more hours before I eat.  Tonight is my weights day also. Was going to run around lake but didn't finish up in time before sunset
1/8/20, 4:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ok, you can call any time after 11.

1/9/20, 1:54 AM - Lei W: Couldn't resist reading more of my book.  I thought I am different a person and also jaded from reading hundreds of novels since I last read this one in the late 90s, somehow it is even better than I remembered.
1/9/20, 2:07 AM - Lei W: An almost perfect female heroine protagonist, AIs, friendship, family, loyalty, idealism personal and in government, with both sides of the conflict convinced of their version of the greater good, and a villain to root for.   It's rare that I feel so empowered by a story, too bad the feelings will mostly fade by morning. Thus this text to help be remember.  Thank you sleeping beauty for being there even unaware. 💋🌛🛌
1/9/20, 8:57 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Hi love, could you bring the book to NYC so I can read it as well?
1/9/20, 8:59 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Btw just FYI, I can't get myself to call you my "boyfriend" since I have not called someone that since 25 so I am just using "partner" as I feel a lot more comfortable with that.
1/9/20, 10:10 AM - Lei W: You prefer the paperback form and not ebook? Warning you will likely like it less than i do, as it is in all these cases of favorite X/Y.  But the couple of people that I know have read it all loved it.
1/9/20, 10:14 AM - Lei W: Definitions are important like in math but only to uniquely identify mostly. But it does have effects on perception. Had a heated discussion with friends at jt about the indignation of calling native Americans Indians. Personally I don't mind your labels whatever you prefer. Whether it's 'the guy I met at burning man' 'my current hookup' 'partner' or 'boyfriend' etc.
1/9/20, 10:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I love paperback. I don't want to read it because I am expecting to love it. But I have always been entertained by Scifi novels and I am interested in reading a book that moves you. Of course, it is good that you are not the kind of person who would not be offended if I don't love it or would want me to pretend to like it as much as you do.
1/9/20, 10:51 AM - Lei W: I can pretend to be hurt or offended if you don't love love it if you want the status quo!! Old Chinese redneck can still learn some new tricks 😎😜
1/9/20, 10:57 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/9/20, 3:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I love holding and reading old second hand books. I can't wait.
1/9/20, 3:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Maybe I won't get why you like it at all and we'll have an existential crisis of our relationship and I will be calling you "my Burning Man fling" instead of "partner"
1/9/20, 3:35 PM - Lei W: That would be a very valuable insight into potential relationship conflicts.  Interesting no matter how unlikely
1/9/20, 5:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Haha yes, but it is more likely that you read one of my fav books and don't enjoy it as much as me. I loved all books as a child and read equally massive amounts of both heavy (e.g. classics/ philosophy etc.) and light (e.g. scifi and adventure/ mystery/ detective) literature. I think I read every HG Wells and Jules Verne before 10. My ex owned all Isaac Asimov and Philip K Dick books so I read and enjoyed them all as well. So def biased towards liking books like this but we shall see and I will be brutally honest.
1/9/20, 5:44 PM - Lei W: But hopefully not extra picky! User reviews on Amazon is very high at 4.7 but the editor review is harsh. I would be more curious about your opinion on plot points and not book quality
1/10/20, 11:45 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I got my assistant to research and buy yearly laminated calendar like yours and a small whiteboard to track weekly goals, both for my office so as work expense. I will see what comes in next wk and will send you a photo.
1/10/20, 1:57 PM - Lei W: Will be curious to see!
1/10/20, 6:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/10/20, 7:28 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Have a great weekend ❤
1/10/20, 7:57 PM - Lei W: She looks great of course, admire the hard work she put in at her age. Neither of us can be so dedicated to fitness exclusively but a fifth of the effort will get 50% of the benefits!
1/10/20, 7:59 PM - Lei W: Going to spend most of the weekend working extra to prep for upcoming on-site demo, wish me luck in productivity. But will hit the gym/weights for a few hours each day
1/10/20, 8:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You don't need luck to be productive, you just have to will it. So instead of wishing you luck, I will be your cheerleader and cheer you on to be productive at work and in the gym. Imagine me with skimpy outfit with your name on my crop top, on your shoulder with pom poms, telling you in your ear you can do it and to keep going ;)
1/10/20, 8:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Love you💋
1/10/20, 8:56 PM - Lei W: Thank you I will use this ancient Korean secret technique.  Love you too good night!

1/11/20, 2:48 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I do want it!
1/11/20, 3:33 PM - Lei W: Talk tomorrow night?
1/11/20, 3:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Sounds good. You call me around the normal time when you can!

1/11/20, 6:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I did all 6 v0, last time I did only 3
1/11/20, 6:02 PM - Sang Mi Lee: One of them I only got at 5th try. I also got one V1 at 5th try. I also hot pretty fat on 2 other V1. I bought a 10 class pass. Good for you getting me to finally stick to something I have been wanting to stick to for almost 20 yrs. Thank you.
1/11/20, 7:19 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/11/20, 8:38 PM - Lei W: Great to hear! Making progress and feeling stronger is both fun and addictive.  Congrats!
1/11/20, 8:39 PM - Lei W: Well milf mom and stepmom isn't female centric mostly.  Plus you have an Asian aversion. 😁 Wonder what female search terms are
1/12/20, 5:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Hmm, just occurred to me, I am an attractive, bisexual Asian mom who enjoys Hentai...who can empathize with and share interests with almost anyone...I probably am missing a calling as a high end escort (I would be really good at it in fact) 🤔
1/12/20, 10:33 AM - Lei W: Yes indeed you may be. The empathy in particular is a mark of very high end escorts.  Plus you can talk nerdy to all those rich tech millionaires!
1/12/20, 11:47 AM - Sang Mi Lee: And I can talk business with non nerdy CEOs. Plus I have the refined (aka snobby) taste to entertain their business partners while looking good on a yacht...and talk about history, which caviar I prefer (though I am nor a huge fan ppl with money to spend really like caviar), and which private art collection I would love to see. Good thing I have a Plan B in case my current career doesn't work out.
1/12/20, 11:50 AM - Lei W: Too much to try too little time in this world
1/12/20, 12:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Speak for yourself, I feel like there is enough time to try everything I really want to experience! Have a productive day.
1/12/20, 4:02 PM - Lei W: 👍😁💃
1/13/20, 3:15 PM - Lei W: Well last night I only needed to stay up til midnight to finish what I needed to finish and today was also very productive even including haircut and tailor stops.  Still, lots of Monday tasks and barely have a moment to relax sending you a text from restroom! But feel good so far hopefully even better by EOB
1/13/20, 6:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It is so sweet that you thought of me in the middle of your busy day to send me a note. I appreciate it! I am exhausted also from a lot of errands, a painful (literally) dentist visit, and a moment of anxiety looking at how I fly back into town on Wed, into 4 pretty intense and important meetings, get home, repack, and fly out to Ottawa that night for all day meeting on Thurs. Ah well.
1/13/20, 6:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/13/20, 7:58 PM - Lei W: So you didn't get that grigri harness combo?
1/13/20, 7:59 PM - Lei W: Not that important as bought separately just a little difference in price.
1/13/20, 8:05 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Not today. Will get it eventually but since I don't need a belay device here, I thought try this harness for now and get more into climbing first.
1/13/20, 8:05 PM - Lei W: We actually ran into a problem no one knew how to solve as of 2.5 hrs ago and people decided to give up for the day.  Only boss stayed til an hr ago when I told him I was able to figure out a proof of concept solution (by learning a subject not my specialty at that).  But I am now at the point that delivering it need the other guys to be here so will go home finally and reward myself with my calories of the day.  Last 24 hrs most productive day in years didn't even use Adderall!
1/13/20, 8:06 PM - Lei W: Yes less $ for initial foray into any hobby is best I wish I had your wisdom. 😁
1/13/20, 8:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 🍾That's awesome!
1/13/20, 8:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 🤞for delivering it and others stepping up
1/13/20, 8:08 PM - Lei W: Will try to cap it off with leg and chest day... Will see.  Work accomplishments is mostly self known the others don't actually know enough to understand the  scope of what I did today
1/13/20, 8:09 PM - Lei W: I know, which is better than external validation
1/13/20, 8:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Go unwind, and fyi I have built in enough time to leep in and climb on Sun and Mon in NYC along with Empire state and MoMA. Will send you a schedule tomorrow night!
1/13/20, 8:10 PM - Lei W: Good night! Thanks for listening. 😘
1/13/20, 8:10 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Unwind (aka work your hot body in your case)
1/13/20, 8:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thanks for sharing and leaving me with an image of your sexy brain and body to get me to sleep
1/14/20, 10:29 AM - Lei W: Good luck on your hectic schedule today as well! I know you are good at making everything fit but my well wishes shouldn't hurt. ❤️
1/14/20, 12:21 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Certainly not! Hope everything at work is going smoothly for you as well!
1/14/20, 12:21 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 🥰 I love you!
1/14/20, 7:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I had so much work and school work that I almost did not go to the gym, but I got myself there and felt relaxed after. Listening to lectures now on behavioural econ and choice architecture/ nudging etc. and feeling proud of my decision. I did 2 more V1s but I could not climb any autobelay 5.9 and one of the two 5.8. I wish I could see you when you get home today, ask if everything at work is ok and ready for Thurs, and give you a massage.
1/15/20, 12:24 AM - Lei W: Glad to hear that you felt better after some physical effort to balance out the mental one.  Of course when you try to boulder at limit and also rope climb the latter tries would be much weaker. Luckily for you and other beginners the rate of improvement is fast.
1/15/20, 12:27 AM - Lei W: Had to pick up more slack at work but mostly productive.  Would love a massage and someone to complain to as I can't do it where anyone else can hear! Hope you are dreaming wonderful dreams.  Sending you 💖💜💋
1/15/20, 12:28 AM - Lei W: Landing in San Diego around 10pm ET will text you after settling in
1/15/20, 7:01 PM - Lei W: Landed right on time! Hope your day and travels have gone well. Text when I am  in hotel prob 11et or 1130
1/15/20, 7:23 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am not traveling today to Ottawa, am traveling next week Wed (ie get in from NYC Wed AM into all afternoon of meetings, get kids, leave them with parents and fly out to Ottawa at 9pm).
1/15/20, 7:25 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/15/20, 8:37 PM - Lei W: We have yet to play scrabble ourselves! I've played too many back in the day.  And what's 6 figures in saving lives? 2.4?
1/15/20, 8:37 PM - Lei W: Rental and checkin took a while now going to get some fast food to take back to room for last minute prep work
1/15/20, 8:41 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Well it doesn't save lives just prolong for some months...
1/15/20, 8:42 PM - Sang Mi Lee: When you get back with food can I just call to say best wishes? Super quick. I need to get to bed for all day of Senior Pharmacist interviews tomorrow!
1/15/20, 8:45 PM - Lei W: Would love to talk for a few minutes! Will text you in about 10 min
1/15/20, 8:57 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/15/20, 8:58 PM - Lei W: Call me anytime I'm back
1/15/20, 11:28 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/15/20, 11:33 PM - Lei W: On the software side, I actually got the additional thing working better than I expected, so I find myself with an extra hour to screw around before bed. Means I can eat my meal slowly  reading news to relax, an enjoyable reward. Here's to hoping we stay on agenda with middle managers and IT of homeland security.
1/16/20, 2:31 PM - Lei W: We didn't get kicked out, nor did they sign million $ contract on the spot.  But presentation went very well.  Participants were fairly engaged.  What I wrote late last night was useful in demo. My boss was more nervous last night but after lunch he feels good
1/16/20, 2:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 👍🍾🥂
1/16/20, 4:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Your boss is lucky to have had you keeping cool by him. Hopefully you have down time planned! I had one very strong candidate though was slightly uncertain re: personality fit.
1/16/20, 8:02 PM - Sang Mi Lee: A little random but...I realized recently how I masturbate less now as orgasm is just never as good as when I am with you. I find it interesting as it must be a more psychological reaction where I feel my orgasms only own just isn't as satisfying/ intense as it used to be...love is a complex, funny thing 😘
1/16/20, 8:20 PM - Lei W: Totally my fault for raising expectations? We'll work on it? 😊
1/16/20, 8:23 PM - Lei W: Or it could be temporary... Depending on how long you have been feeling a difference
1/16/20, 8:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Definitely very noticeable since our last time together...it obviously makes it that much more exciting/ special to see you so you are just raising the bar for yourself because you like stress and pressure? But I am totally fine for you to work on it as hard as you want to...? ❤
1/16/20, 8:57 PM - Lei W: As hard as I can.... Yes... 😎
1/16/20, 8:57 PM - Lei W: Good night!
1/16/20, 8:57 PM - Lei W: 🍆🍌🍾
1/16/20, 9:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You picked up the pun. Drifting to sleep already!
1/16/20, 9:13 PM - Lei W: D*$k jokes are hard to miss... We are trained for spotting them
1/17/20, 6:44 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hope your day was great and did not involve too much work!
1/17/20, 7:28 PM - Lei W: Pretty relaxing. Most of the work related to demo so not much urgency afterwards. Watching a movie 1917 now good night see you tomorrow! Can't wait
1/17/20, 8:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Text me when you are on board. Xo
1/18/20, 7:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: It's a blizzard here but still says much flight it on time so about to make my way to airport for my noon flight.
1/18/20, 7:44 AM - Lei W: What's your flight number? I'll monitor it. For 45 min anyway til I take off
1/18/20, 7:47 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I have a lot of buffer for delays anyhow.
1/18/20, 7:47 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/18/20, 8:05 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I texted last when I was leaving my place. Within 15 min, I am sitting in the lounge - 11$ uber ride, through short tunnel to island airport and through security.
1/18/20, 8:24 AM - Lei W: In seat safe flight will text you when I'm on train from jfk
1/18/20, 8:27 AM - Lei W: Can you text me hotel info again?
1/18/20, 8:28 AM - Lei W: Nevermind I found it Fairfield inn
1/18/20, 8:29 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I will text you the room # before you land
1/18/20, 8:29 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Have a good flight!
1/18/20, 12:57 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Room 610. Use 8th and 32rd exit from penn. Pretty much right out of the station.
1/18/20, 1:30 PM - Lei W: Just landed, prob be at hotel around 6.
1/18/20, 1:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have snacks for us but no drinks. Could you grab a couple please and thank you!
1/18/20, 1:53 PM - Lei W: Drinks? OK 3 kegs of beer coming up
1/18/20, 1:59 PM - Sang Mi Lee: 😆
1/18/20, 3:06 PM - Lei W: Had a bit of trouble with the trains but should get there in about 15 min

1/21/20, 3:06 AM - Lei W: Good thing the gloves fit you! Realized they were in room when I got to elevator but didn't want to knock and make you get out of bed to let me find them. Also bought an extra unneeded new jersey transit ticket instead of LIRR. 😏
1/21/20, 5:14 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I can use the gloves today for sure!
1/21/20, 5:14 AM - Sang Mi Lee: But you really could have knocked, I could have said another good bye
1/21/20, 5:15 AM - Lei W: Yes but i wouldn't have wanted to make you more awake
1/21/20, 5:15 AM - Lei W: Hope you make use of the gloves I don't need another pair anyway
1/21/20, 5:16 AM - Lei W: Taking off soon have a good day! Really enjoyed the trip
1/21/20, 5:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 🤗😘 will see you soon enough and will bring it to you! Safe flight! Hope you can sleep on the plane.
1/21/20, 1:52 PM - Lei W: Maybe the gloves and underwear were my subconscious trying to make sure you were warm in the gray white north..
1/21/20, 1:53 PM - Lei W: 13c in Oakland feels balmy after nyc before the trip it felt cold
1/21/20, 1:53 PM - Lei W: Now have to try to do a full day's work in a half day
1/21/20, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: ❤ gloves were extremely useful

1/22/20, 7:31 PM - Lei W: Pass out! Great to hear
1/22/20, 7:31 PM - Lei W: 💖 Going to gym text later
1/23/20, 12:36 AM - Lei W: 3 gold 🌟s for that much productivity.  Leave some for the rest of us please thank you.
1/23/20, 12:46 AM - Lei W: Gave some feedback to Alisa on her website UI if she's in charge of the design that's a lot of work she had to do.  At work there's some pessimism about the other contract but boss wants to keep giving raises which is good for me I guess.
1/23/20, 1:05 PM - Lei W: Is Alisa the friend you helped negotiate equity percentages? She told me more about her product launch dates and mentioned they were looking for a cto when I asked for project details to clarify my feedback
1/23/20, 1:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes, and thank you love for being so helpful. I spent some time with them last evening and saw no red flags if you are considering being their CTO.
1/23/20, 1:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/23/20, 1:50 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Got in uber to airport. 1 hour to flight. Traffic. Cutting it short!
1/23/20, 1:52 PM - Lei W: Good luck on traffic! I wouldn't lend credence to new job positions yet even consideration it's too early plus lots of complicated factors
1/23/20, 1:55 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Agree this would be prudent but of course I expect no less from you.
1/23/20, 2:04 PM - Lei W: Then again some of life's best experiences and alterations are the result of network connections you never know
1/23/20, 2:04 PM - Lei W: When are you going to be settled enough for a night call?
1/23/20, 2:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I can work with your schedule any time after 10:30. Slept a lot last night.
1/23/20, 2:20 PM - Sang Mi Lee: To clarify, that means I intend to be up till my normal midnight ish bedtime so even if you call between 10:30 to 11:30 I am good for ~30 min convo. Yay I made it to airport!
1/23/20, 2:34 PM - Lei W: OK will let you know around 10et if I can call
1/23/20, 5:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Np. I am free same time on Fri and Sat, but not Sun. Was not expecting you to be free since I seem to recollect it is Lucy's bday. Hope you had a great day at work, love you!
1/23/20, 5:32 PM - Lei W: Yes it is Lucy's bd your memory isn't alzheimered yet!
1/23/20, 7:13 PM - Lei W: Call you around 11et
1/23/20, 7:50 PM - Lei W: Maybe 1115 quick call
1/23/20, 7:53 PM - Sang Mi Lee: K
1/23/20, 8:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/24/20, 1:04 AM - Lei W: Your handwriting is a lot better than mine, that's the only thing I'll admit for now. But it seems this is a good view and worth the $0 extra I paid!

1/24/20, 2:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ice climbing! Something else I hopefully get to try with you. A couple of ppl who have seen pictures of me in NYC asked if I hired a professional photographer!
1/24/20, 2:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It was a long day for me with putting out a fire first thing in the AM and at 2pm I had nothing to eat and one of my staff had bought McDonald's  and left it on my desk for me to come back to from a long meeting with industry! And Anchalee packed me dinner. I am still a little wired plus a bit worried about finding time to study finance without neglecting my children but all in all I am so lucky to be making a difference with my work and have such wonderful team. And I love seeing your photos and glimpses of your past. One thing Alisa had said about you before I left her was "I see that he won't bore you and I know how important it is for you have someone who can challenge and stimulate you"
1/24/20, 2:30 PM - Lei W: Technically that's a yes as I've been paid multiple times for it so I will be a 'pro' forever no matter how bad I am.
1/24/20, 2:31 PM - Lei W: Ice climbing is easier than rock climbing physically just needs more gear mostly.
1/24/20, 2:34 PM - Lei W: Harder decisions means you care about both.  Haven't eaten mcds in a while dieting is such a Lei world problem but I feel better eating vicariously through you.

1/25/20, 9:45 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night! I am definitely going to be dreaming of firm valuations, EBITDA, PE ratios, etc. Hope your night is more exciting 😘
1/26/20, 2:28 AM - Lei W: 💪🏻
1/26/20, 2:31 AM - Lei W: Watched a movie at home after coming back late from yosemite.  Much warmer than Xmas, 15c vs 2 at valley floor but still snow and ice on valley rim.  Will process photos tomorrow but here's 2
1/26/20, 2:33 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/26/20, 2:33 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/26/20, 6:00 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Did you try midnight lightening? Thx for the photos, a gorgeous start to my day.
1/26/20, 10:23 AM - Lei W: No, brought my crash pad and planned to give it some effort after hike but due to snow came down a bit after dark and hurried to get to that same restaurant, but missed closing time by 2 minutes anyway. 😭
1/26/20, 2:05 PM - Lei W: https://photos.app.goo.gl/VhFrudoP1AJGgh8E7
1/26/20, 2:06 PM - Lei W: Some turned out decent even though weather wasnt perfect sun was behind clouds on top before sunset
1/26/20, 2:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Truly breathtaking and the little snowmen are so cute!!

1/26/20, 2:09 PM - Lei W: Butt shot!!!! With underwear outline showing in that one I think their group was from Scandinavian country
1/26/20, 2:10 PM - Lei W: Very nice! Watermelon with cake is the best
1/26/20, 2:10 PM - Lei W: Good luck with exam
1/26/20, 2:21 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/26/20, 7:33 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Can you talk for a bit?
1/26/20, 8:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Hi, exam was ok esp given I had not had time to read the textbook or do 50% of practice questions. I am going to bed, can we talk tomorrow or Tues? I am free after 10:30. Good night❣
1/26/20, 9:13 PM - Lei W: Sorry was at movies again planned before I saw your message that you could chat, forgot to tell you.  Can talk or Tuesday. Unless you have a preference, tomorrow (mon)?
1/26/20, 9:18 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Tues is fine but I am annoyed as you did have at least a couple of chances on at least two of occasions where I talked about chatting/ writing after to let me know of your plans. Though ultimately it is really not a big deal, I know you didn't say you were available but default to you not saying is not not being available just for future reference...
1/26/20, 9:20 PM - Lei W: Yes definitely my bad my first thought was 'ack! Why didn't I mention it?'
1/26/20, 9:22 PM - Lei W: When I don't confirm I am still likely available much of the time but not always, but I guess safer assuming 50/50?
1/26/20, 9:23 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good question. And you did say back on Thus that you would be free Sun
1/26/20, 9:24 PM - Lei W: Yes I did
1/26/20, 9:24 PM - Lei W: Want to talk on phone for a few now?
1/26/20, 9:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And I mean good question as it is worth asking yourself whether it was really that you forgot when I wrote earlier I am free at x if you are free or you didn't want to bother getting into it and having to figure out when to talk.
1/26/20, 9:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: No, I have my parents sleeping in the living room. I am still glad you had a nice evening and I already went through 30 min of why am I doing this with someone 3 hrs time zone away and decided you are worth it ❤
1/26/20, 9:26 PM - Lei W: 😢
1/26/20, 9:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I still get to he annoyed and you can definitely be inconsiderate re: communication/ lack thereof
1/26/20, 9:26 PM - Lei W: The movie was OK no big deal
1/26/20, 9:28 PM - Lei W: Do be annoyed yes. Being inconsiderate is the best reason
1/26/20, 9:29 PM - Lei W: This is where I can have an excuse to send unnecessary flowers if I had time to google fu your apt number...
1/26/20, 9:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: To *be* that is and really given Kobe story, I am really grateful to have you in my life. I thought for 5 min what my life would be like without dating you and there were definitely an easy answer that my life would be less...
1/26/20, 9:31 PM - Lei W: Sorry to ruin your night hope tomorrow morning starts better
1/26/20, 9:31 PM - Lei W: Love you
1/26/20, 9:32 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You didn't ruin it at all. We had lovely chats before and it was nice for you to not react by saying I am overreacting.
1/26/20, 9:34 PM - Lei W: I can still do that if you prefer to have more justification to be mad. .. But I know how important sleep is so I'll skip it just this once
1/26/20, 9:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: But I do have to request you me in a bit more re: your schedule. I don't care what you do, where you go, who you do it with, just would like to feel more like part of your life, e.g.  you have not even said which movie you saw. Neither yesterday or todsy
1/26/20, 9:35 PM - Lei W: Weathering with you by same director as your name
1/26/20, 9:35 PM - Lei W: Figure it won't be available for long and might not be easily available on streaming
1/26/20, 9:36 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thx. I do have a big meeting Tues so we can talk Tues night. Plus I will be tipsy having gone out with friends :)
1/26/20, 9:36 PM - Lei W: Yesterday was zombieland double tap. Very different movie genres
1/26/20, 9:37 PM - Lei W: Tue not mon? It's a date
1/26/20, 9:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I don't have time but would look it up to see what it is, it just helps me better feel like I am part of your life and understand what you do or do not enjoy.
1/26/20, 9:38 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Is 10:30 possible?
1/26/20, 9:38 PM - Lei W: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/weathering_with_you
1/26/20, 9:38 PM - Lei W: Yep 1030
1/27/20, 2:06 AM - Lei W: I replied to your email and after mentioning that I feel bad, said that I wouldn't say anything from my point of view until we talk over the phone.  However, after thinking for a bit, realized that it may be worse for your feelings.
1/27/20, 2:14 AM - Lei W: I will just say that with the long email chain about other subjects mostly, your saying you can't talk on Sunday on WhatsApp, and me wishing you good luck focusing on your long study preps today earlier, I was generally confused about things.  I am a person that values other people's time generally a lot more than my own, so your anger on the subject is justified but not due to my intention to belittle yours.
1/27/20, 2:22 AM - Lei W: Additionally, I do try to tell you a lot about my life, much more than anyone else by far right now, but I will say straight out that I can not apprise you of all my activities that take me away from my phone for an hour or two unless I put all such on a shared Google calendar the moment I plan them.  But i do think we should talk about how best to schedule calls ahead of time without confusion as this has happened before.
1/27/20, 2:25 AM - Lei W: Once again, I am really sorry that I've upset you. I do hope your workday goes well even with lack of sleep, and think about me less until I can apologize over voice.
1/27/20, 2:47 AM - Lei W: You deleted this message
1/27/20, 2:49 AM - Lei W: Text is a poor communication medium and I'm bad at it. Please please pretty please don't make me write more long winded messages on important subjects.
1/27/20, 4:24 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I promise.
1/27/20, 4:45 AM - Sang Mi Lee: And love, by wanting to know about your life more all I want at this point is like one more point in the sentence. I am going climbing with my friends (to Yosemite) on Sat. I saw a movie (title, it was good). I am not asking to know everything, darling. Non bracket you said, within bracket info gives info that makes it more like a conversation between friends. I am pointing out your tendency to share very little even on things that are not private or takes long to communicate. And you are right, text is a bad medium, and even in my email, what I was trying to explain was my reaction to you being unfairly coloured by hurt from a previous relationship.  Talk to you tomorrow. Have a great day!
1/27/20, 7:05 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/27/20, 11:40 AM - Lei W: As you progress through the day and handle items one by one you might feel better that you can get a handle on all that. I have faith in you anyway
1/27/20, 12:34 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thx for your patience last night. I'm sorry. No need to respond to my apology 😘
1/27/20, 12:36 PM - Lei W: 🤐🙊😶
1/27/20, 6:44 PM - Lei W: It's was a survived Monday? Interviews went well and feeling ready to unwind right about now?
1/27/20, 7:55 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Interviews went well, approved website UAT to go out to internal and external key stakeholders, got board meeting agenda out with less a less ambitious agenda than I was originally targeting but certainly good enough, dealt with HR problem, delegated a couple of things I had to admit to myself I could not get done without exhausting myself further. Meant to do some school work but that will have to wait since I doubt my brain will absorb it now and sm going to bed. So I survived.
1/27/20, 7:56 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Send me a random photo of you taken tonight so Icsn wake up to it? 🤗
1/27/20, 9:00 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/27/20, 9:01 PM - Lei W: https://youtu.be/kdemFfbS5H0
1/27/20, 9:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It's just for me...in fact this was nice on helping me fall back asleep...just as I fell asleep Jamie at exactly midnight going onto his bday just now came to my room totally hyperventilating and freaking out from a nightmare...took 3 min to get his heart to slow down and I am awake, he is cuddling me passed out. What can you do, such is my beautiful life. Thx for the photo, I miss and love you.
1/27/20, 11:53 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/28/20, 7:00 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am rather anxious about one of the meetings this afternoon...I scripted all the speaking points for all the execs and it is supposed to be a visioning and goal-aligning and motivating meeting that could really go either ok (at best, given current culture and flawed incentives) or terribly...could you send me some words of encouragement before  2 et?
1/28/20, 10:30 AM - Lei W: It's true that even scripted meetings often go off track depending on some minor point discussed, but I know you were up to the challenge of giving them the best outline you can given the time.  Instead of luck, for pedestrian people, I hope that it turns out as close to the expected mean with little standard deviation as possible. Can't really control other people so it's out of your hands.  💪🏼In 30 minutes!
1/28/20, 3:01 PM - Lei W: Think your big meetings are over? Don't know what 'Dreyfus' on your calendar is at 6et but since it runs late I will assume at least somewhat personal and not stressful.  Hope your network and the pCPA people took your negative messages as well as can be hoped for.  🥂 to another survival day
1/28/20, 3:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: It is a very nice restaurant and for a little business and a lot of fun.
1/28/20, 3:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And both meetings went as well as possible
1/28/20, 3:22 PM - Lei W: Also there's supposed to be a small surprising thing I won't tell you more, but I am curious about your reaction when we talk tonight after you get home
1/28/20, 3:22 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Which is not exceptionally well but better than expected
1/28/20, 3:23 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Roger that
1/28/20, 3:23 PM - Lei W: Eat well!
1/28/20, 3:23 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Very good wish because I was so busy I only had 1 slice of cake the whole day
1/28/20, 3:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My assistant tried to buy me lunch and I said I was too busy to enjoy the food
1/28/20, 3:25 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/28/20, 7:15 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I never had a cable that could charge both of my phones at the same time.

1/28/20, 7:30 PM - Lei W: All that work and I still put down the wrong # on Amazon.  But was curious if that cable is only 1 phone at a time.

1/28/20, 11:33 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/28/20, 11:37 PM - Lei W: Also tell me the next few days you can talk, instead of waiting til Friday
1/29/20, 7:39 AM - Sang Mi Lee: So so cute! I was exactly as chubby at the same age!
1/29/20, 7:41 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Fri, Sat or Sun at 11. I will text next week (Mon to Sun) availability EOB this Fri
1/29/20, 7:43 AM - Sang Mi Lee: And lastly, yes it is a lovely photo. I have no issues with you sharing beautiful memories of your exes even missing them or what you had.
1/29/20, 11:16 AM - Lei W: Invite sent on calendar.
1/29/20, 11:19 AM - Lei W: Alisa pinged me that co-founder Ben is up for a chat if I'd like so she wasn't 100% joking about that cto prospect as we guessed. Going to read through her deck and ask more questions to start
1/29/20, 11:22 AM - Lei W: It's the age old dilemma of not being able to make everyone (including myself) happy no matter which option but that's what the negative side of responsibility is all about I guess.
1/29/20, 7:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: What I say to others (and would like to do one day for myself) is first and foremost prioritize yourself and pick a course of action that maximize whatever utility you choose as important for your life.
1/29/20, 7:09 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Did you ask that girl about Olympic tickets?
1/29/20, 8:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And I forgot to mention this twice already - I want to dance in Vegas...even if it is just for an hour, no need to go anywhere fancy or expensive cover...but I am currently dancing around the living room as I clean so remembered to mention it.
1/30/20, 12:58 AM - Lei W: Not yet. 😒
1/30/20, 12:58 AM - Lei W: Well Vegas night clubs are a thing just like its gambling so lots of choices
1/30/20, 1:00 AM - Lei W: So you admit to talking the talk but not walking the walk? Shame on you! You can do better
1/30/20, 1:12 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/30/20, 10:03 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I told my bosses to start thinking of my succession planning as they have me latest to the end of the year.
1/30/20, 12:20 PM - Lei W: I stand corrected.  You ran the walk.  Congrats, and that will motivate me more to do the same

1/30/20, 12:55 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/30/20, 1:26 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Thx, not sure if you really understood what big deal...almost my entire team has told me they will leave if I leave on top of the fact organization needing me more broadly but truthfully I am overworked, underpaid, and not learning and growing the way I should be so I told them it is in my best interest to leave by summer but that I am willing to stay up to end of the year to get new hires settled and help them map out future strategic changes and have enough time to hire a good candidate.
1/30/20, 1:27 PM - Lei W: I know it's a big deal, I hope they know but not sure if they are capable of giving you enough power to prepare.
1/30/20, 1:28 PM - Lei W: Overworked, underpaid, that is expected from masochistic you. But not learning and growing, that has to change
1/30/20, 1:29 PM - Lei W: Love you, you are awesome. Haven't said that directly in a while
1/30/20, 3:46 PM - Sang Mi Lee: One of the things that prompted this was earlier this week I got final mark of A+ in Business Operations class (1 of 2 with this grade in the class). I put in pretty little effort (compared to others who volunteered info on time they spent) and did not do many of the readings. However, I knew I would do well because I have managed a few big operations. I realized I am so good at keeping this machine (at my current organization) running despite poor organizational structure and support, that it is not in the interest of executives to allow me the learning and growth/change I want and put me in a high level strategic planning position (though I am currently telling consultants what they should write and doing the visioning and strategic planning anyway). And prepping for board meeting I also realized how much resistance there was in the culture I am in for innovation and creative thinking, and I would just never be able to apply 80% of what I learned/ am learning from MBA. So I feel really proud of myself for overcoming guilt and doing what is right for me! ❤❤ Thx so much for your support, have a great night!
1/30/20, 3:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Also told them the position has no time to develop and coach the team properly and they need to change the org structure for my successor.
1/30/20, 3:52 PM - Lei W: I don't believe you are anywhere close to calling it a night this early, but I sure hope so! Not hearing an overly enthusiasticly (enough) 'good job' message from me is true worthy cause for throwing a tantrum. I know next time you can do it? 😉
1/30/20, 3:53 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/30/20, 3:59 PM - Lei W: ... resistance for innovation... <> "change the org structure for my successor" hmm something doesn't match
1/30/20, 4:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yup, I said it because it needed it to be said not because they would do it. I wanted to call it a night and just play with kids and go to bed with them but got pulled into work again. Fyi, my children even never tantrumed like in that GIF...but I bet it feels good...should try it when on my own next time someone is frustratingly incompetent and doesn't know it.
1/30/20, 4:36 PM - Lei W: 👍👍😁
1/30/20, 4:48 PM - Lei W: If you can't throw a tantrum (perhaps jokingly) in front of your significant other who can you do it in front of?!  I promise to try throwing one in front of you if you reciprocate
1/30/20, 4:49 PM - Lei W: Everyone needs to act immaturely once in a while to let off steam for psychological health IMO
1/31/20, 10:36 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
1/31/20, 11:30 AM - Sang Mi Lee: And I found my perfect Senior Pharmacist who is an engineer (1st degree) and a pharmacist (2and degree) who was everything I wanted in a candidate!! So I survived and the week was amazing (including my talk with bosses).
1/31/20, 11:46 AM - Lei W: The week was amazing? Or was it your work? Debate me later
1/31/20, 11:49 AM - Lei W: BTW I know we scheduled for tomorrow night but I may go to gym a bit later today, if you still want to chat for 30 min tonight. Only if you have nothing else planned
1/31/20, 11:49 AM - Lei W: (still talk tomorrow also)
1/31/20, 11:51 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Sure could def do a quick 20-30 min debate on how this wk was after 10:30.❤
1/31/20, 11:52 AM - Lei W: You know I was on the debate team right? But you don't know which side of the argument I'm trying to prove... Will call you at 1031
1/31/20, 8:03 PM - Lei W: Yes... Love you... Before cut off
1/31/20, 8:03 PM - Lei W: ❤️💋
1/31/20, 8:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am not one to care whether you say it back you know. I will tell you if I feel unloved! Funny, I actually even with my kids...I feel dopamine when I kiss them and say I love you but when they kiss me and say I love you, I don't get the same feeling of dopamine flow. Hmmm will have to ponder that more later.
1/31/20, 8:09 PM - Lei W: You just trained me not to say it...? 😉
1/31/20, 9:00 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
1/31/20, 11:18 PM - Lei W: The article summary : sex rekindles romance.  Kinda circular logic. But I may be missing context.  You sent text at midnight hopefully it means you went to sleep on time
1/31/20, 11:19 PM - Lei W: Gym session was short but successful.  Did all (13)of their v5s and flashed 4 v6s before closing time

2/1/20, 4:31 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I should have pointed to the section that mattered...the top of the page not what you could see on post. I was trying to say I love you so very deeply that I hope we get to be one of those ppl still madly in love decades after they met.

2/2/20, 6:25 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I wonder how old he is. You have nicer abs/waist definitely. Though genetically he may have had to work extremely hard to get this body vs. someone else (I am not going to say you necessaily because you too had to work hard for your current body, to build the muscles/ size since it is hard for Asians to be bulky). I still look at the photo you sent of you flexing once every few days :)

2/2/20, 11:14 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 13 is total number other than J or you, not after J (so just 9 from Jan 2018 to Aug 2019). I was curious for myself.
2/2/20, 11:20 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/2/20, 11:21 AM - Lei W: Yes but can't compete with height or white guy! Thanks though
2/2/20, 11:22 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I wa pointing out he is not much more taller than you!
2/2/20, 11:22 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Any you are stronger, which is very sexy
2/2/20, 11:26 AM - Lei W: I noticed you said... Til Aug 19.  I know you said you haven't had the desire and turned down some opportunities since, but technically you could have and those numbers are still accurate? 😁
2/2/20, 11:28 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Haha yes I am still at 15.
2/2/20, 11:28 AM - Lei W: I hardly do any abs work. Just side effects of climbing and low body fat.  That's genetics. But my V figure is all hard work and much better than most except body builders
2/2/20, 11:29 AM - Lei W: I hope you /we get that number higher soon...
2/2/20, 11:31 AM - Lei W: Did a bit of research on female 3rds and a bit discouraging except for paid chat about it next call
2/2/20, 11:41 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am not counting anyone where there was no penetration so no women here so it may take us a little  time
2/2/20, 11:43 AM - Lei W: I know you weren't counting women, but then again I don't know if you want to do everything with a couple or a single guy either, another topic for discussion
2/2/20, 2:38 PM - Lei W: I've been uploading a few pics here and there to google maps when it asks me to review places I've been, for a few months.  Apparently the River Cafe is popular, or just NYC in general. Top viewed
2/2/20, 2:38 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
2/2/20, 6:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I am interested but any time soon I think (want to be with you/ know you even more intimately/ experience you a lot more before I go there), so I said it will take time. Also I noticed I wrote "flight" instead of "fling" but I think you understood.
2/2/20, 7:26 PM - Lei W: Yes there is no hurry from my side either as there's a lot we have to explore between the two of us.  Whatever we feel like trying in the moment unless something requires pre planning
2/2/20, 7:29 PM - Lei W: You had another productive weekend and ready to tackle Monday I'd guess. 💪🏼
2/2/20, 7:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: If by productive you mean watching 4 hrs of marketing lectures between playing with kids then yes. Trying to get an outline of my book review done before I go to bed!
2/2/20, 7:39 PM - Lei W: 💖❤️💋
2/2/20, 7:39 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes for me I think because I have not been with a lot of women it is still a very interesting and exploitative curiosity I have
2/2/20, 7:40 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And I really do feel very satisfied with you and really do not feel pulled towards any other men
2/2/20, 7:41 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Though I am good with you feeling differently with other women
2/2/20, 7:44 PM - Lei W: These two last messages differ and you have mentioned them before, and I want to ask you next call (as in I don't want to interrupt your review with these thoughts now)
2/2/20, 8:27 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Just laid down in bed. Sweet of you to be considerate but really on me to put the phone away till I am done, which I did.
2/2/20, 8:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have only been in 1 committed relationship in my life and it was necessary to be monogamous. But I loved him so I made that choice willingly, but I had not liked it...
2/2/20, 8:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: So I am every day delighted at learning about feelings that are new for me
2/2/20, 8:32 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Including how committed I feel for you emotionally and physically
2/2/20, 8:34 PM - Lei W: As you have said many times before, and this is something both of us are good at, you are good at taking ownership of self faults(managing time in this case) but providing less distractions doesn't hurt , merely makes the job easier.
2/2/20, 8:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I love you, good night! Miss holing you and your warm gorgeous body
2/2/20, 8:35 PM - Lei W: Thank you it is always flattering to hear you say it, good night and sweet dreams to you honey bunches
2/2/20, 8:37 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
2/2/20, 8:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Oh and I know for reasons I will tell you later this is not because of newness of our relationship or anything like that...❤
2/2/20, 8:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My kids' fav cereal right now!!! Seriously
2/2/20, 8:38 PM - Lei W: Lol no it is not a sign of anything just confirmation bias. 💖
2/2/20, 8:39 PM - Lei W: But this makes it more likely I will use this endearment term in the future

2/3/20, 4:51 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I went to climb for an hour and a half. I was not too tired but my hand hurt as they got soft again...bit it helped me clear my head, and it was great!
2/3/20, 4:56 PM - Lei W: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻So happy to hear that you not only got exercise but also de stressed a bit as bonus indeed that is a side effect sometimes.  Happy Monday senior manager moma bear Ms Lee
2/3/20, 4:57 PM - Lei W: 💋🌹

2/3/20, 7:21 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My group mate put together all the upcoming last module deliverables...so much to do but so close to the end!!!
2/3/20, 7:24 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/3/20, 7:43 PM - Lei W: 😘😁 Great to hear he's found well too
2/3/20, 7:58 PM - Lei W: On a sadder side as I read more about the Wuhan virus it seems  concerning. It isn't related to your work but I bet you are talking a lot about it casually
2/3/20, 8:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Correct in that it does not affect my work directly but it does affect other areas of government significantly and many of my MBA classmates are people who are directly involved with the emergency planning for Ontario and Canada.
2/3/20, 8:37 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I was also an intern in hospital during SARS briefly
2/3/20, 8:40 PM - Lei W: Right now it's at something like 200k infected and 435 fatalities but Chinese numbers aren't reliable but already higher than Sars. Will be higher than 10k I'd wager. You don't have to worry if you survived Sars first hand you will be immune to all future pandemics I guarantee it personally
2/3/20, 8:41 PM - Lei W: I just sneezed I gonna bite it. Good bye cruel world.
2/3/20, 8:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Should I take advice from medical school drop out? ;)
2/3/20, 8:52 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Good night love!
2/3/20, 9:00 PM - Lei W: Are you taking the under or over? Put your money where your skepticism is. 😎 Dropout or professional gambler?
2/3/20, 9:00 PM - Lei W: Right on time, so good to hear. 🥰🌙
2/3/20, 11:27 PM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
2/4/20, 1:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Darling, where is your crash pad???
2/4/20, 1:29 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/4/20, 2:34 PM - Lei W: It's barely visible through the bushes in front of my friend. You know when the old timers did this problem first crash pads weren't a thing and they had no idea how hard the moves above the no fall zone was and once committed, irreversible.  Actually he wrote about it interesting read if you have nothing to do for 10 minutes (likely lol 😅)
2/4/20, 2:35 PM - Lei W: https://rockandice.com/john-long-tales/john-long-high-times/
2/4/20, 2:41 PM - Lei W: That hand writing is like a real doctor's.  Is that the candidates answer or your notes on his answer? I almost got a headache trying to discern it.  🤕
2/4/20, 2:44 PM - Lei W: Also, once near the top, the spotter, if without 2 crash pads, needs to move the pad vertically against the small Boulder to prevent back/head trauma rather than ground fall leg/ankle injury
2/4/20, 2:58 PM - Sang Mi Lee: My notes on his answer and I twice in uni got points deducted on exams from bad handwriting because the grader got so upset but it meant I got 90 instead of 95 or whatever.
2/4/20, 2:58 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I don't normally take any notes because I cannot often read my own handwriting.
2/4/20, 3:01 PM - Lei W: Not reading one's own is bad no getting around that. Slowing down doesn't help or you don't want to? I get sloppy if I hurry too much also.  You are trying to dig deep to talk about your shortcomings? Luckily for you hand writing is going obsolete
2/4/20, 3:03 PM - Lei W: Many classes have note taking services in fact I transitioned my med school from writing to typed/online as scribe head 18 years ago
2/4/20, 3:05 PM - Lei W: I hate taking notes because it distracts me from listening or reading. Only sometimes I go back and summarize later
2/4/20, 3:07 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I can slow down and write beautifully but cannot be bothered. I stole other ppl's notes in school...well they kindly gave them to me. I have to for interviews...beurocracy
2/4/20, 3:09 PM - Lei W: *bats pretty lashes* your notes are so good can I take a look? Oh thanks you are a sweetheart 🤗
2/4/20, 3:20 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I am a nice and social person with a lot of friends, I did not have to flirt.
2/4/20, 3:32 PM - Lei W: Obviously you know I know that.  But apparently my attempt at humor by bringing up a sexy imaginary scene like you are capable of, failed the candidate evaluation. 2/15 for Mr. L. Wang, better luck next time.
2/4/20, 3:34 PM - Lei W: I will have to make up for it with punishments of my own devising
2/5/20, 1:19 AM - Lei W: You have very thin thongs white or black I assume?
Also, if size 7 or 8 shoes usually which is more likely to fit?
2/5/20, 1:20 AM - Lei W: Yes I had fun browsing for your 'work' outfits... 😎😁
2/5/20, 1:20 AM - Lei W: Also buying white thigh high stockings unless you have a bunch
2/5/20, 4:02 AM - Sang Mi Lee: 7 probably. Yes on thongs. I do not have white thigh high. Weren't you supposed to go to bed early??
2/5/20, 10:58 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/5/20, 1:08 PM - Lei W: Very organized.  I think I guessed Feb 5 too.
2/5/20, 1:09 PM - Lei W: I went to bed midnight but stayed up reading Vegas message boards til late. Wasn't as tired as I should be.
2/5/20, 1:12 PM - Lei W: Also, after i found a bunch of outfit related items on Amazon.com I also looked on Amazon.ca and not only was the selection much less but some of the prices is much worse then the currency exchange rate. Plus if shipped to you your luggage will be fuller.  Ie. $18 cdn for a $10.90 US item. You poor native Canadians... 😕

2/5/20, 7:15 PM - Lei W: For some reason it feels strange that I would not be unhappy that you took time out of your busy schedule to do something so 'off the beaten push'. 😜
2/5/20, 7:15 PM - Lei W: Will watch later after I get back from gym
2/5/20, 11:00 PM - Lei W: Very nice. Maybe neither you or any of the students are pros but it's definitely sexy and it doesn't hurt you have the best body...
2/6/20, 9:42 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Most kids there are undergrads! So...thanks :) It is kind of embarrassing but choreographed dance is sooo different from just dancing. It is a snow storm kind of day, working from home with Mia as I could only get Jamie into camp on this strike day. I am just writing you a random nothing to say hello, after getting more strike notices, rearranging my schedule, and feeling exhausted (often the case first 2 days of my period even when things are not crazy).
2/6/20, 11:05 AM - Lei W: Random nothings are better received than intentional messaging in some ways.  Ie. A big hug for no particular reason vs. A 9pm daily scheduled hug
2/6/20, 11:07 AM - Lei W: In modern society don't we treat exhaustion with drugs and coffee and alcohol? You would know 😁 God forbid resting or sleeping or ignoring low(er) professional or personal duties
2/6/20, 11:09 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
2/6/20, 11:15 AM - Sang Mi Lee: This made me think women are always depicted as having wine to destress vs. men with whiskey etc. Only alcohol I have in the house is Scotch. 2 more hours till I can call it in terms of work day and can have a dram.
2/6/20, 11:16 AM - Lei W: OK 23 bottles of wine incoming from Amazon....
2/6/20, 11:16 AM - Lei W: (just kidding sorry to disappoint)
2/6/20, 11:18 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
2/6/20, 11:19 AM - Lei W: Though this was the first image I found but she doesn't look as exhausted as I imagine you to be
2/6/20, 12:06 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Ugh, ice...
2/6/20, 12:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/6/20, 12:16 PM - Sang Mi Lee: And reason why I am annoyed is why I am still letting J control my life...I.e.I would love to just say I have a partner in SF who I eill be climbing with and I do need to take a course on ice climbing so if you  are ok on this not being a date I would really like to find the time though it is very possible I may not find time at this point
2/6/20, 12:17 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Maybe I say that and say not to tell other parents? That seems so childish. Ugh. Ok back to work, sorry about my messy personal life.
2/6/20, 12:23 PM - Lei W: Be sorry if you want but I love it when you complain about your messy personal or professional issues.  Hearing them  is a privilege few have, even disregarding my joy at getting to know you better. But of course don't go out of your way to say them if it takes time out of your day and you are busy.
2/6/20, 12:34 PM - Lei W: You are not letting J control your life you are just managing social messaging given that people are unpredictable.  Of course I would actually like it, not mind at all, if you hang with him. It benefits me in the long run and in the unlikely event that he wins you over despite your not being interested, he must be so awesome that I would top my hat to him. As to how to avoid his trying hard for you without spilling your Oakland secret, I am confident you will figure out how to behave /what to say in person
2/6/20, 12:42 PM - Sang Mi Lee: You made me feel 110% better. Guess this is what secure relationships are good for. Love you!
2/6/20, 1:54 PM - Lei W: 💖Package delivered 4:21 ET to receptionist at your building (30 min ago)
2/6/20, 4:08 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Can we do a video call tomorrow night? Not for any dirty stuff, just so I can see your face and you can see me in the shirt?
2/6/20, 4:10 PM - Lei W: Yes! I promise I will wash my laundry before then, scouts honour.
2/6/20, 4:12 PM - Lei W: Shirt smallest size was 4 but I had intended it to be a sleep shirt so hope it's fine for that purpose.  Also as I said on call, one of the new 6ft cables is for me. Your first one is 3 ft long maybe not as convenient for travel.
2/6/20, 4:13 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Yes I understood (both the cable and pajama shirt part)
2/6/20, 4:14 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I was looking at photos from NYC and thinking how cute and handsome you were btw.
2/6/20, 4:14 PM - Lei W: Yes it's true you are smarter than I look

2/7/20, 12:32 AM - Lei W: Have fun and knock'em dead tomorrow!

2/7/20, 10:15 AM - Lei W: 🏆💝👫
2/7/20, 10:27 AM - Lei W: The only item for Vegas that was close in price I shipped to you was supposed to deliver Monday but it said delivery was noon today (Canada post). After you take a look I'll leave it up to you whether you show me what it looks like tonight or wait for Vegas
2/7/20, 5:11 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I have not clicked on your link tou sent via email nor did I open the package. I will get it open it while we chat.
2/7/20, 5:12 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Next wk I can talk Tues, Wed,  and Fri
2/7/20, 5:12 PM - Lei W: Woot process streamlined
2/7/20, 5:16 PM - Lei W: Happy TGIF congrats on wrapping up another (primary) work week with another SML stamp of accomplishment
2/7/20, 5:35 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Kind of just feel like I barely survived vs. accomplished. But wrapped up another competition and just waiting to get union clearance on 2 administrative assistants I want to provide offers to. Also amazing candidates, one is very young with massive potential with political sci bachelor from Queen's and journalism degree afterwards, and s much older gentleman who would be excellent as well with masters in HR from India...but I know they are also interviewing for other positions and want to scoop them up, did ref checks today. Mia coughed all night 2 days ago and esp when I have my period my immune system is not so great...very happy if is Sat tomorrow and all I have to do is just two things: read a 68 page report and take a few notes for school and go swimming with the kids. Phew!
2/7/20, 5:41 PM - Lei W: I'd think you often feel that you merely survived but I was talking from my(and others) POV.  Good luck with your health we all need it.  Nice work with interviews last weeks

2/8/20, 10:53 AM - Lei W: Hope they had fun. I see the start of the speed route to Mia's left.
2/8/20, 10:58 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I just did that speed route but very slowly and could not do the very last move.
2/8/20, 10:59 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Jamie made it all the way to top of 5.3
2/8/20, 11:01 AM - Lei W: That's great. Using the speed holds exclusively is mid 5.10 and never varies between gyms
2/8/20, 2:20 PM - Lei W: https://youtu.be/4cLahXtiiws
2/8/20, 2:24 PM - Lei W: That was a few months ago and was one of the biggest moments of the season only second to Janja from Slovenia winning 6/6 world cups and 1st in world championship and Olympic qualification.  Above Chaehyun Seo coming out of nowhere and dominating lead shead of Janja
2/8/20, 2:27 PM - Lei W: ^ Janja sweeping was Bouldering, Seo could not attempt Olympic qualification because she didn't do speed(no one knew, even herself or her dad, before it was too late for her to train speed)
2/8/20, 6:47 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I only got to climb 3 times in 2 hours but kids had a really good time and Mia might do a bday party there.
2/8/20, 6:49 PM - Sang Mi Lee: ❤ the agenda! So excited, it will really help me get through this wk!
2/8/20, 6:50 PM - Lei W: Spammed you with email but going to eat and go to bar to watch ufc at 10pm.  Two championship fights outcome lopsided but still will be entertaining
2/8/20, 8:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Spent almost 2 hours mostly listening to a friend going through or about to go through divorce and found myself saying...there is a lot in life that is important, but I am happiest when I can prioritize my children and my relationship. There are rare days where work or school takes priority, but then afterwards I realized that doing so in fact makes me more emotionally stressed. Thank you for the happiness and perspective you bring to my life. Good night!
2/9/20, 1:04 AM - Lei W: I'm sure your friend really appreciated your time listening.  Our relationships as everyone says is the most important accomplishment in life. Ufc was interesting but results quite controversial.  Got a good workout in at home afterwards

2/9/20, 6:46 AM - Sang Mi Lee: Actually the cute girl talking to me in the gym the other day was very similar looking to Monique but blond and blue eyes. Probably similar height too as she was at least 2 inches taller than me.

2/9/20, 5:19 PM - Lei W: If you are using them that means you have to keep them instead of gathering dust under all my other pairs!
2/9/20, 5:22 PM - Lei W: Blonde blue eyes athletic and cute, lucky boyfriend I'd say.  Reminds to keep an eye on Moniques career to see that a nice person is having a great life as she deserves
2/9/20, 5:24 PM - Lei W: Went to the gym but it was a high gravity day.  But did put in the effort just need to ramp down and give my old man body more rest.  Oscars just started and Brad Pitt won the first as expected playing an authentic loyal friend. Parasite has 50/50 shot still of winning best picture and making history
2/9/20, 5:30 PM - Lei W: And line in a joke by one of the presenters about Canadian Healthcare ie. You people have it good
2/9/20, 8:06 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I dropped off kids and did 4 hours of school work and now winding down watching pornfof first time in a while, mainly threesomes, for real research and ideas. Mmmm to be on top of a hot girl with you in my mouth and the other girl sucking your balls...
2/9/20, 8:47 PM - Lei W: Wow just finished watching the oscars and came back to your message and a wildly different image.  You just made me instantly horny. Glad to hear you are winding down from productivity like this.
2/9/20, 8:55 PM - Lei W: I hope you were able to give your self that happiest of endings for sleep aid. 😘 Can't wait for next week, just exploring each other's bodies or letting others into our world, I'm sure it will be plenty of pleasure.
2/9/20, 8:57 PM - Lei W: Parasite just exceeded all expectations winning foreign film, director, and best picture. Boon Jong Ho the director also seemed kind a genuine humble person. Very happy to have watched it with you.
2/9/20, 11:03 PM - Lei W: Regarding your topic I found two photos from 2010 first with two girls the second is me having fun at a group shoot, added to the same album

2/10/20, 8:26 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I can go to the Olympics with you!!! And only a little bit of swearing and nastiness from ex...can't believe he agreed to exchange the weeks.
2/10/20, 11:15 AM - Lei W: Very excited to hear about that! Let's talk about the trip in Vegas.  Re: ex, sometimes adults need to be tolerated and treated as kids throwing tantrums.  You have to be the reasonable calm adult as you are good at.
2/10/20, 11:51 AM - Lei W: Also finally bit the bullet and posted questions online about providers in Vegas and got very helpful answers.
2/10/20, 2:47 PM - Sang Mi Lee: Given that it is the only adult movie I watched for myself in 2019 (if I don't count fast forwarding through some movies in between studying on my way to and from Asia in the summer, I gotta say I did well watching the one movie that won! Thanks for that. Just eating dinner at the airport...my best candidate in my admin competition accepted my offer. Woo hoo!
2/10/20, 2:50 PM - Lei W: Woo-hoo!!!
2/10/20, 2:50 PM - Lei W: Selfie of dinner if not done yet. 😁
2/10/20, 4:30 PM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/10/20, 4:31 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I had charcuterie and cheese plate for dinner. Easy to eat while working and yummy.
2/10/20, 4:31 PM - Lei W: Wine is even better! Still early for my food thanks for letting me live vicariously ❤️
2/10/20, 4:32 PM - Lei W: Wishing you productive meetings in Ottawa
2/10/20, 10:01 PM - Sang Mi Lee: I saw Frank for drinks because he happened to be in Ottawa's as well for business, and I was talking about you without a name and he says "What is his name, you can't call him your boy or man when he is the first ever to get you to love and open up and be vulnerable." And Frank says "I hope he knows how lucky he is, but don't have that conversation with him yet because everyone needs their own time to process things."
2/11/20, 2:35 AM - Lei W: I hope Frank is doing well! I'm sure he really enjoyed seeing you briefly even if it's bittersweet.  I do feel very lucky, and trying to avoid thinking about how much.
2/11/20, 2:41 AM - Lei W: <Media omitted>
2/11/20, 11:16 AM - Sang Mi Lee: I am flattered but I certainly do not have that nice of a body...maybe when I a done school. However, Frank noticed (even in the lounge lighting and fully clothed) that I was more toned in my upper body!
2/11/20, 11:21 AM - Sang Mi Lee: <Media omitted>
2/11/20, 11:27 AM - Sang Mi Lee: He does say he is jealous of you ;) and I have to say I am so very grateful I can talk to you like this and don't have to worry about what I can and cannot say to you etc. Thank you!
2/11/20, 1:47 PM - Lei W: It's always great to have people notice the external results of any regimen that must be satisfying!
2/11/20, 1:50 PM - Lei W: Other people/society's "best figure" may be different, and your own opinion also, but I don't have to justify or convince anyone else I find your body great. 😎😘
