We'll specify the mode of questions submission later.
11/3/21, 11:48 PM - +91 83055 15824: ⚠️ *//Confidential//* ⚠️

12/26/21, 3:59 PM - +91 83055 15824: Ok✅👍🏻
12/26/21, 5:33 PM - +91 83055 15824: We are almost done with the preparations. Will be releasing the event tonight at around 8-9 pm...📌✅ (OR maybe tomorrow morning, just in case if there's some delay).
12/27/21, 6:26 PM - Abhishek: 📌 *_UPDATE_* 📌

• The dates for our latest event "New Year Fest" (which included gaming and creative writing contests) have been moved to mid-January.

• Previously, it was scheduled to release today and was to continue throughout the week (we had the official permission for that). But today, we were requested to shift the dates further.

• All preparations are 100% complete. We are just shifting the dates from this week to the second week of January 2022.

• Apart from the dates, no other changes have been made to the event.

• Maybe we will forward the flyers, info etc. in a few days, but the contest will be later. In fact, this will give us more time for marketing and increase the number of participants.

Enjoy the New Year...👍🏻✨
