20/11/2019, 12:29 - Tan Xin Kai: Preliminary update on "brown" water at Tekong on 20 Nov 19.

Reports from Coylines & cookhouses starts from 0430h onwards. FMA activated contractor and arrived in Tekong at 0630hrs. The plumbers immediately did flushing at the mains. We informed PUB to conduct their checks and if they did any works.

PUB checked on two water main supply points from PUB into Tekong. 
*Pt 1 (upstream supply) to Rocky Hill Camp (Sch 4) tested no problem but will continue to check the water source periodically.
*Pt 2 (downstream supply) to Ladang Camp (Sch 1, 2 & 3) as source of problem. Awaiting report on any damaged pipes. PUB sending additional team to Tekong to conduct leak test.

All buildings with rooftop water tank is not affected and water can be used. Those on lower ground level as the source is from Pt 2.

Coyline can still use water source from toilet level 3 and above. This will likely to last about 1 day. For safety, do not consume from all watercoolers in the meantime. Mr Raj will engaged the SSMs directly to help disseminate the info.

Cookhouse will tap water from water tank to do cooking. Washing of utensils n crockeries to be minimised. Camp Ops and FFC working on the ground. May need to use disposable items and outration. Mr Sng will liaise directly with FFC and the Coy on ration arrangement.

PUB has activated 2 x portable water tanker to reach tekong at 1315hrs. Location will be at Coopkhouse 2 & 3. PUB will make assessment if more is required and for long term sustainability plan if the problem persist. PUB Ops team will be in at 1300hrs to conduct further assessment (on the downstream pipe problem).

Next update at 1500hrs.

get(key)¬†- Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value)¬†- Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
The cache is initialized with a¬†positive¬†capacity.

‚Ä¢ Control speed
‚Ä¢ Watch out for motorcyclist, they sometimes don't give signals
‚Ä¢ No changing at zig zag lines
‚Ä¢ Turn right is hard
‚Ä¢ No need rush 

S-Course: 
‚Ä¢ Cannot strike/mount kerb, turn slowly
‚Ä¢ 1 free reverse manoeuvre (check back)
‚Ä¢ Confirm safety (check when in/out) 
Crank-Course:
‚Ä¢ Same as S-course
‚Ä¢ Use zig-zag manoeuvre when Corner touches kerb, turn wheel
‚Ä¢ Turn in use door handle if left
‚Ä¢ Use door lock if turn right, But straighten vehicle first, turn at turning point
‚Ä¢ Also can use feeling
Dir. Change:
‚Ä¢ 1 free additional reverse 
‚Ä¢ Must check right/back when reverse 
‚Ä¢ If cone is elevated, 1/2 of cone (half white) / else full cone

‚Ä¢ Check back again after straighten wheel
‚Ä¢ Do not open door
‚Ä¢ Remember to adjust back mirror after parked***** (P then hand brake)
‚Ä¢ When go out 1 door length for verticle
‚Ä¢ If not perfect can release wheel a bit until front wheel past kerb then straighten by full lock (also can drive forward but waste time)
‚Ä¢ If not perfect put to D then straighten wheel a bit then reverse until okay then full lock
‚Ä¢ The s course area is 3/4 from kerb, crank course 3/4 from bumps

Parking (Parallel):
‚Ä¢ Line up like kerb side stopping 
‚Ä¢ No turn wheel whilst stationary 
‚Ä¢ Confirm safety ( 3x) 
‚Ä¢ 5 mins max 
‚Ä¢ Initial position depends on location (some mirror touches sign, middle door handle at front touches kerb)
‚Ä¢ Check when initial reverse
‚Ä¢ Signal left & check + adjust mirrors
‚Ä¢ Full lock left until mirror see 1 bar
‚Ä¢ Check then reverse while wheel straighten till rear wheel touches line

‚Ä¢ Lane change cannot occur abruptly
‚Ä¢ Side clearance to cyclist/objects (can slowly pass-by cyclist)
‚Ä¢ Adjust mirror bef driving
‚Ä¢ Braking technique
‚Ä¢ While overtaking, can force by slowly
‚Ä¢ Route 10 very rare also heavy traffic plus got highway exit need to watch out
‚Ä¢ U-turn via shoulders but make sure to not miss it
‚Ä¢ No sudden acceleration when suddenly light turns yellow - dangerous to side road users
‚Ä¢ Only accelerate when overtaking when applicable 
‚Ä¢ Try to inch (release break) after stop at stop line to see if there is traffic or not
‚Ä¢ Inch only when no car/ confident turning
‚Ä¢ Observation is very impt (T junction, motorcyclist, distance of car behind)
‚Ä¢ One of the route no need to keep left (all parking space) (teck whee) 
‚Ä¢ Check for pedestrian (for right turn especially.)
‚Ä¢ Slow turning = can turn into correct lane (for left turns)

‚Ä¢ Go on Amber light else IF since hard breaking is dangerous
‚Ä¢ First in Junction check right and left/ mirror

E-break:
‚Ä¢ Hold firm steering wheel and step hard on brake, confirm safety when moving off (blindspot), signal right to move off when its safe
Steering Wheel:
‚Ä¢ When reversing, the vehicle response to the steering wheel is not as sensitive as when you are driving forward. tendency to oversteer when reversing.
Handbrake:
‚Ä¢ Only use on slopes/parking
Side mirror adjustment:
‚Ä¢ Adjust the side mirror until the horizon is slightly above the centre line. Part of the body of your vehicle should be seen in the mirror.
Blind spots:
‚Ä¢ changing lane, overtaking and turning.
Correct braking:
‚Ä¢ Depress early Depress hard Reduce pressure gradually
Negotiating bend:
‚Ä¢ Before bend, slow down. At bend, accelerate
CHANGING LANES
‚Ä¢ estimation of speed and distance of vehicles approaching from behind before (beside) car
‚Ä¢ checks: mirrors, signal, blindspot
‚Ä¢ Slow down to let (beside) car pass / speed up to pass (beside) car (depends on position, speed etc.)
‚Ä¢ When it is safe, accelerate smoothly and steer gently into the lane intended whilst looking in front (beware of front car stopping)
‚Ä¢ Only cross centre lane when got obstacles

03/05/2021, 13:29 - Wh: RVRC is basically an old hall refurbished as an RC. Worse facilities (not in UTown), no aircon, really hot rooms (I‚Äôve slept there for two nights and it was terrible), not tall enough for good views, drama regarding discipline (I think resolved now?) and all in all a set of modules that don‚Äôt interest a lot of people. But at the same time, no one I know from RVRC has ever complained to me about it, so I guess YMMV. It does feel cozy and chill, and their mods might be appealing to others!
