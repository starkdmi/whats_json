24/10/22, 11:32 pm - +237 74290497: ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e=((sx^2+tx+u)^2-(mx+n)^2.Expand and solve for s,t,u,m and in terms of a,b,c,d,e
The solve
sx^2+(t-m)x +u-n=0
sx^2+(t+m)x+u+n=0..
This is the basis of the Ferrari method...
25/10/22, 12:37 am - +234 813 206 4316: Am not sure, But even if it works the solution will be an imaginary root...
25/10/22, 12:38 am - +234 813 206 4316: But am sure it can be solve
25/10/22, 1:04 am - +237 74290497: An imaginary root is a solution ...

25/10/22, 4:37 pm - +91 82985 25725: So this expansion is wrong
25/10/22, 4:37 pm - +91 82985 25725: Moreover where is 3
25/10/22, 4:37 pm - +91 82985 25725: Constant
25/10/22, 4:39 pm - +234 813 206 4316: No I switched the integrals
25/10/22, 4:39 pm - +91 82985 25725: How can u switch that
25/10/22, 4:40 pm - +91 82985 25725: If u can cancel 1 r term
25/10/22, 4:40 pm - +91 82985 25725: Then what is the need for the quadratic
25/10/22, 4:40 pm - +91 82985 25725: Expansion

25/10/22, 5:17 pm - +91 82985 25725: My answer is this one only
25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Nay
25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +91 82985 25725: I had simplified it further..... But over in all

25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +91 82985 25725: It is this answer only
25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +91 82985 25725: No it is correct
25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +91 82985 25725: U can see
25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +234 813 206 4316: No
25/10/22, 5:18 pm - +91 82985 25725: As of here if we take 2 in common with log
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 82985 25725: Log 2 will will be there
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 82985 25725: Which can be taken in constant
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +234 813 206 4316: You should have use partial fraction
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 82985 25725: There is no need
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 82985 25725: Here substitution can be applied
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Why?
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 82985 25725: When substitution can work
25/10/22, 5:19 pm - +91 82985 25725: Why to use partial fraction
25/10/22, 5:20 pm - +234 813 206 4316: That's a good question
25/10/22, 5:20 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Wait a minute
25/10/22, 5:21 pm - +91 82985 25725: I can expand my answer in this form ..... Wait
25/10/22, 5:21 pm - +91 82985 25725: Bcoz it is the same only
25/10/22, 5:21 pm - +237 74290497: I think trig substitution ...
25/10/22, 5:21 pm - +91 82985 25725: Why
25/10/22, 5:21 pm - +91 82985 25725: What is the need for that
25/10/22, 5:22 pm - +237 74290497: I don't know
25/10/22, 5:22 pm - +91 82985 25725: Then why to take so muchh lengthy
25/10/22, 5:22 pm - +91 82985 25725: It is simple
25/10/22, 5:22 pm - +237 74290497: Yes this integral is very simple anyway...
25/10/22, 5:22 pm - +91 82985 25725: Exactly
25/10/22, 5:23 pm - +91 82985 25725: Don't make it too much complicated by using advance theories yrr
25/10/22, 5:25 pm - +234 813 206 4316: You didn't divide it by the derivative of the inner function which is 2r
25/10/22, 5:25 pm - +91 82985 25725: Are
25/10/22, 5:25 pm - +91 82985 25725: I did it
25/10/22, 5:25 pm - +91 82985 25725: Didn't you see there
25/10/22, 5:26 pm - +91 82985 25725: Why should I divide it twice
25/10/22, 5:26 pm - +91 82985 25725: And it get cancelled as well
25/10/22, 5:26 pm - +233 27 131 5489: Dats is de rule

25/10/22, 5:26 pm - +234 813 206 4316: And it won't be correct if you do it that way
25/10/22, 5:26 pm - +91 82985 25725: What kind of rule is this.....
25/10/22, 5:27 pm - +91 82985 25725: This is not the case
25/10/22, 5:27 pm - +234 813 206 4316: üòÖ
25/10/22, 5:27 pm - +234 813 206 4316: I don't have more to say...., but wait
25/10/22, 5:28 pm - +91 82985 25725: I really don't know..... What is there so muchh logical in this simple question that you guys r thinking such a advance rules n all
25/10/22, 5:28 pm - +91 82985 25725: Even answer is alsoo matching still u guys r saying that it is not right.....
25/10/22, 5:28 pm - +91 82985 25725: Ok u guys continue..... I need to go now. ...... Bye

25/10/22, 5:30 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Thati what you Will get if you use partial fraction
25/10/22, 5:31 pm - +234 813 206 4316: There are some questions that doesn't require substitution
25/10/22, 5:31 pm - +234 813 206 4316: You can use substitution for this but it will be trig sub
25/10/22, 5:31 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Do you understand?
25/10/22, 5:31 pm - +234 813 206 4316: ?
25/10/22, 5:32 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Or what do you think Mr Felix?
25/10/22, 5:35 pm - +237 74290497: Hyperbolic functions substitution can also work if you know hyperbolic function...
25/10/22, 5:36 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Yh

25/10/22, 5:42 pm - +91 82985 25725: But in indian maths system I don't think there ka any issue in this substitution
25/10/22, 5:43 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Hmmm, ok

They are a couple of ways to the same exercise...
Partial fractions is good...
25/10/22, 5:53 pm - +91 82985 25725: Exactly
25/10/22, 5:54 pm - +234 813 206 4316: You haven't done what I ask you to do

25/10/22, 6:28 pm - +237 74290497: + and - are defined in terms of situations...
When written in mathematics ,I think we are dealing with directional integers.
When experiments are now in involve in physical systems...
t and - may change...
So in quantum mechanics per the definition,it can be true......

What is the definition of wrongness?
Life is relative and as such we have got pure standard...
Sharp and conclusive evaluations could land us in an inferno...
If you were Einsteins' university professor,what will you great him...(stupid right?)...
Most of these theories we evaluate ourselves about and test our know how about were brought about by people who believed wrongness and correctness is but relative...
Don't always tell your students they are wrong..
Proof them wrong by doing what is right...
Many of us here are a fruit of teachers who see their children as empty vessels and tabula rassas ...
Only to be filled...
You must acknowledge your students have some competencies to develop and direct them without dispicing their abilities.....
This is exactly who *the teacher* is...
Giving mathematics a pedagogic touch...

31/10/22, 4:44 pm - +237 74290497: Yes that is it....
Persuasion is in the proof...
This is what science is right?
Proof by experimentation...
31/10/22, 4:50 pm - +237 74290497: They are uncountable ways to proof a wrong answer is wrong but only one way to proof that it is right......
I mean any teacher can tell his child you are wrong even without showing the right.....
Yes brothers,if there is an opinion you have,present it without proving your neighbor's inability...
Afteral,you are not right justified because of another's failure...
*This is pedagogy and CBA*...
We don't tell children they are wrong.We show them how they can be right from the wrong step we see in their work.
Take them where you made them making sure they don't recognize your destruction of what they knew...

31/10/22, 5:45 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: To reflect is not to destruct, but comprehend and contemplate.

31/10/22, 8:21 pm - +234 813 206 4316: I have solve it, but it took me long time
31/10/22, 8:24 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: The answer is: we look for at least a set with 7 partition blobs with summation ((49+1)49/2)/7
31/10/22, 8:25 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Not easy as you think
31/10/22, 8:25 pm - +234 813 206 4316: It somehow hard to manipulate numbers

Interestingüòä
31/10/22, 8:29 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I gave the statement boundaries. The solution requires some algorithmic rationale whose branching may be high
31/10/22, 8:29 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Indeed
31/10/22, 8:31 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: The algorithm is a challenge for your inner engineer

31/10/22, 11:10 pm - +237 74290497: Yes good work..
So no really straight forward method...
31/10/22, 11:28 pm - +234 813 206 4316: The solution makes the question looks cheapüòí
31/10/22, 11:29 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: You should say it is cheap to Ramanujan
31/10/22, 11:29 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: He liked partitions
31/10/22, 11:31 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Ramanujan solve Monster question as if he it is a pretty question
31/10/22, 11:34 pm - +237 74290497: Ya at least some of us here deserve a pat on the back from beginning from the middle of no where and not arriving...
This is not a straight forward solution anyway...
31/10/22, 11:38 pm - +237 74290497: What is the theory behind the solution...?
31/10/22, 11:39 pm - +961 70 955 584: I have no idea. This is not my solution
31/10/22, 11:41 pm - +234 813 206 4316: I think the solution is straight forward
31/10/22, 11:41 pm - +234 813 206 4316: It is easy and direct

31/10/22, 11:44 pm - +237 74290497: Yes I thought so but it became combersome to calculate...
31/10/22, 11:44 pm - +234 813 206 4316: I like questions like this they are logical..., They deal with thinking
31/10/22, 11:55 pm - +237 74290497: bet you..
This can be very applicable...
31/10/22, 11:56 pm - +237 74290497: Think we all have favorite areas in the subject.

I know in programming,you derive a mathematical equation first before writing a program based on it...
01/11/22, 1:55 am - +234 813 206 4316: You can learn it from your textbook or you can search it on YouTube, I think you will find help
01/11/22, 1:56 am - +55 62 9178-5156: Yes, Mustapha tells a great advice. You should exercise your programming skill doing exercises.
01/11/22, 1:56 am - +55 62 9178-5156: Mathematical thinking is helpful
01/11/22, 1:56 am - +55 62 9178-5156: This is a good exercise: try with two instead of three numbers
01/11/22, 1:57 am - +266 5754 1553: Yes

02/11/22, 11:57 pm - +234 813 206 4316: So on what condition?
02/11/22, 11:58 pm - +233 59 487 9615: Will it bent away from the normal or move away from the normal
03/11/22, 12:01 am - +234 813 206 4316: Since it is moving from a less dense medium to a dense one , I think it will bend away from the normal
03/11/22, 12:01 am - +225 0171768666: Can you excuse me normally I am a student of 2nde. I am in the group because I like the mathematics and the physics . I see that the group isn't for the small as me

03/11/22, 12:26 am - +234 813 206 4316: The bending of an object when it enters new medium also depends on Snell's law, so if you don't understand Snell's law you should be asking that question

This is an effect of refraction (real shallowness of ponds).....
Sometimes ,it may be invisibles.....when light rays from it refract into air and does not enter the observers eyes......
When light travels from one medium to another...
nsin@ is a constant...
n is refractive index of each medium and @ the angle the ray make with the normal in each medium...

03/11/22, 3:02 am - +234 811 089 9920: Though I understand everything you did here but assuming you're a teacher would you teachs your students this method?
03/11/22, 3:05 am - +234 813 206 4316: How many numbers greater than 2000 can be formed using digits 1,2,3,4,5,6?

03/11/22, 3:18 am - +961 70 955 584: The question is to find r and s, i found them fast without much calculations. I don't understand where's your problem. Maybe you're jealous because it's better than your method?
03/11/22, 3:19 am - +234 811 089 9920: What's this, who cares if Your method is fast or not?
03/11/22, 3:20 am - +961 70 955 584: You said if i am a teacher... So if you are a teacher and show students your long method, I'm sure they will hate the subject
03/11/22, 3:20 am - +961 70 955 584: The simpler the better

03/11/22, 3:21 am - +55 62 9178-5156: Show students long calculations and they will understand how mathematics can be boring
03/11/22, 3:21 am - +55 62 9178-5156: And it is okay
03/11/22, 3:22 am - +55 62 9178-5156: Let speed for the machines.
03/11/22, 3:22 am - +234 811 089 9920: I don't even need to argue with you because you're the person that send the question on here and at the same time you're still providing solution to it, when you have the solution to the question already why are you posting it here?
03/11/22, 3:22 am - +961 70 955 584: When i sent it i didn't have the solution, i tried to solve it later and i did quickly
03/11/22, 3:22 am - +55 62 9178-5156: Why do we even teach if teachers are those who know the answers already?
03/11/22, 3:23 am - +234 811 089 9920: Please mind your speech, because I wouldn't mind to insult you if you try to pass any form of insult.

03/11/22, 3:26 am - +234 811 089 9920: So you're here to test my ability or what?
03/11/22, 3:26 am - +55 62 9178-5156: It was a philosophical question.
03/11/22, 3:27 am - +55 62 9178-5156: It should be pretentious to say there is nobody who knows much on human knowledge
03/11/22, 3:28 am - +55 62 9178-5156: In fact, we should ask "how much do we know?"
03/11/22, 3:29 am - +234 811 089 9920: Don't worry then, I have questions for you too

03/11/22, 3:42 am - +55 62 9178-5156: Since 5^x and 5x are monotonically crescent
03/11/22, 3:43 am - +55 62 9178-5156: x = 1: 5+5=10
x = 2: 125+10=10
03/11/22, 3:43 am - +55 62 9178-5156: It means, x is close to right side of 2

03/11/22, 3:58 am - +961 70 955 584: For part 2, you want integer solutions?
03/11/22, 3:58 am - +234 811 089 9920: So you're telling me that you don't know that the question can be solved with newton Raphson method without even testing it?

03/11/22, 4:05 am - +234 811 089 9920: And even if you'll test in newton Raphson method, you just need to check the values in the equation that Will be very close to zero not exactly zero
03/11/22, 4:06 am - +234 811 089 9920: You can use Lambert W function to solve the equation if you don't want to use newton Raphson method

03/11/22, 11:17 am - +237 74290497: Not really...
Some of them can be computer without calculators...
Any that needs a calculator,then direct algebra will not give you a quick answer...
This is the use of Wolfram alpha...

03/11/22, 11:24 am - +237 74290497: Too long...
It is not the length of method I think ...
It is if the method gets a wider scope of answers....

04/11/22, 3:29 pm - +234 803 465 9390: Maybe it's because of its a voice note
04/11/22, 3:29 pm - +234 813 206 4316: The reason is that your English is too fast
04/11/22, 3:29 pm - +234 803 465 9390: Yea

He is a subsistent man.
All crop is food for the stomach..
Another man will know that Freedom is freedom to look for more food so every key is the key to freedom.....

Every crop is either 
1)food for the eater
Or
2)seed for the sower..
This pic is great wisdom.

09/11/22, 5:36 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I like to picture this algebraicly or geometrically: for the former, the couple of equalities a (x^2+b y^2 = c, d x + e y = f) represents an ellipse and line respectively. It means, there are either 2, 2 or 0 solutions in case the line is secant, tangent or does not intercept the ellipse.

09/11/22, 5:38 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: The algebraic case corresponds to the substitution of either x or y from eq. 2 into 1 and solve by 2nd order equation method.

09/11/22, 10:52 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: No, it is a strong question
09/11/22, 10:53 pm - +234 811 089 9920: What question?
09/11/22, 10:53 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: What do you mean by "understand"?
09/11/22, 10:53 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: HEre
09/11/22, 10:53 pm - +234 811 089 9920: You can browse it on Google if you don't know the meaning of understand
09/11/22, 10:54 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I cannot
09/11/22, 10:54 pm - +234 811 089 9920: Or better still check your dictionary because I'm not your dictionary
09/11/22, 10:55 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: Well, you will have trouble to comunicate, if you cannot express clearly what you mean.
09/11/22, 10:56 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I will pose how do I read: "Explain me what is this function f useful for."
09/11/22, 10:57 pm - +234 811 089 9920: What are Said there is glaring and vivid, so if you can't interpret what you have there then I guess it's your own problem
09/11/22, 10:58 pm - +234 811 089 9920: After much cogitation I found out that you cherish argument a lot and I don't have time for that now.
09/11/22, 10:58 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I see. I hope you find what you are looking for.
09/11/22, 10:59 pm - +234 811 089 9920: What are you looking for?
09/11/22, 10:59 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I look for the meaning of "understand" in your question.
09/11/22, 11:01 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: Arguments is what makes more or less better than machines.
09/11/22, 11:01 pm - +234 811 089 9920: I'm only here to drop solution and leave please I don't have time for all these parody.

09/11/22, 11:06 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I can help you understand yourself: oftentimes we look for some pattern in equations to bring a solution, also called the geometrical solution locus. I think what you mean is to look for a manner to explain the given function by means student's of one or several equalities in a mathematical framework to transmit the student purpose and applicability.
09/11/22, 11:07 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: Is it what you mean by "understand"?
09/11/22, 11:09 pm - +234 811 089 9920: This is misconception and I believe you can't see this as the etymology of understand in the dictionary
09/11/22, 11:10 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: That is reason I asked you for your specific application in this broad meaning.
09/11/22, 11:12 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: You do not come to a grocery store and ask for an arbitrary fruit, since they offer many there.

10/11/22, 6:09 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: 1. Scalonate (stair left matrix) the linear system;
2. Isolate a variable in ONE equality and substitute on the n-1 equalities. Repeat. 
3. (Most computacional intensive): invert left matrix A and multiply by right vector b.
10/11/22, 6:11 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I think we should look for some way to compute or necessary & suficient conditions for bounded integral of form int( f(x) exp(-x^2), 0, Inf )
10/11/22, 6:15 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I think any smooth function suffices, but it is not a necessary condition.

10/11/22, 10:46 pm - +234 811 089 9920: But do you know whether the person have heard of matrix before?
10/11/22, 10:48 pm - +234 811 089 9920: I can use gaussian elimination, gauss Jordan, crammers rule but the question is do I know whether the person will understand it? and that's why I decided to use the preliminary method.
10/11/22, 10:48 pm - +237 74290497: Yes someone solving simultaneous equations with three unknowns is a university student and has to know this...
This is not a wrong assumptions.
It's pedagogic..
Which is why when people ask questions,they should give a proposal...
10/11/22, 10:50 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I like the way these discussions are handled.

10/11/22, 10:51 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: You may provide requirements and some base-material to make the explanation clear.
10/11/22, 10:52 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: It is a negotiation between what your student knows and what you want to bring anew

10/11/22, 10:59 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: You see it as controversy based on experience with others. I answer your question with a kind answer. The denial belongs to your thought workflow.
10/11/22, 11:00 pm - +234 811 089 9920: That's your thought too and I'm less concern
10/11/22, 11:01 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: I agree.
10/11/22, 11:04 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: Either way, you can start by presenting a determined possible 2x2 linear system and introduce matrices
10/11/22, 11:04 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: It is the BEST way to familiarize students to these tools
10/11/22, 11:05 pm - +55 62 9178-5156: 3x3 systems should be taught afterwards for methods you already mentioned

The problem is interesting because we may approximate points by a curve composed by linear weighted gaussian kernel, an elegant solution in regression machine learning.

11/11/22, 7:32 pm - +234 817 682 9504: Do you know anything about hyperbolic function?
11/11/22, 8:45 pm - +237 74290497: The nth term in the series 1,22,333,4444...
 The number of terms in the above series is 
1+2+3+4+---
n=n(n+1)/2=1000
 n=44‚Ä¢22
11/11/22, 8:52 pm - +234 813 206 4316: Correct ‚úÖ
11/11/22, 8:55 pm - +234 813 206 4316: So the 1000th term will be 45 since it is greater than 44
