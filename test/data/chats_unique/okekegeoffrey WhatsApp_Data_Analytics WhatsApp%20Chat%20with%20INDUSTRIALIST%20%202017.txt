The day of the truth is upon us!
A day that we Anambrarians have chosen to live in "a greater tomorrow".
As we head to the polls in less than 24hours, let us join hands to ensure that the labour of our heroes past shall not be in vain by re-electing our willingly working Governor, Chief Willie Obiano to serve Ndi Anambra for a second tenure.
Do not just cast your vote, PROTECT IT by ensuring that the results of the votes cast in your polling booth are counted and announced before leaving for your various homes.
It's your right and do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

30/11/2017, 07:29 - Ipe LeboSmart: Come to think of this?.......
1. Eternal life = free
2. Church entrance = free
3. Christ's salvation = free
4. God's love = free
5. Breath of life = free

A. Cigarette = pay
B. Prostitution = pay
C. Alcohol =pay
D. Nightclub entrance fee= pay
E. Powers to rule the world = pay

Then why are people paying for hell while PARADISE is free?
Think twice
Believe in Christ and you shall be saved..                    
We always think of Valentine's day 
Birth day
Father's day
Mother's day
Children's day
Our day,
Farmer's day
Teacher's day
Christmas day
Independence day
Boxing day,
This day,
That day,
Day in Day out.
Have you ever thought of Judgement Day, is it going to be a day of celebration or condemnation for you?
If you're saved, what about your friends & loved ones. Show dem love by telling dem about d Judgement Day. Please pass this to your 14 loved ones, let heaven be happy with you today. Please don't say later, do it now because tomorrow may be too late. I'll love to receive it if am among the people you care about. Am waiting...

You will finish 2017 strong and well, your dream for the year will manifest, may the last days of the year deliver to you the request of January, there shall be no carry over of your request to the next year. Good morning and happy last day in November, 2017.

"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over."
Psalm 23:5

When the LORD prepares a table for you, no one can upturn it!
God makes sure everything you need is included on increasing measures!
His oil empowers you to enjoy yourself irrespective of your enemies!

Let's pray:
Father, I cease from struggles, toils and endless labour from today!
I step into the platform of Your endless resources and provisions!
Let Your oil of protection and preservation rest upon my head always!
In Jesus Mighty Name!!!
Beloved, enjoy a prosperous December.

06/12/2017, 08:06 - Mr. Geoff: THE LIFE OF A NIGERIAN ENGINEER

An engineer is an individual who has graduated from mere scientific knowledge to a pragmatic/technological status; deploying forensic and mathematical skills acquired in course of his training to invent, repair, maintain, troubleshoot and solve problems of man. By the foregoing definition, he is more mathematical than a mathematician, more scientific than a scientist, more logical than a lawyer, and more creative than an artist. Having successfully covered virtually all topics in mathematics, science, and also covered the fundamentals of law, humanities, management and religion.
It is however regrettable that the engineer is highly neglected by the government of Nigeria, such that the joy and morale of an engineer has almost dropped to the baseline, reducing the graduate engineer to a mere classroom teacher, artisans traders and many more unbecoming jobs to earn a living after graduation. This is unlike his pars in Medicine and Law who are given their staff of office by their automatic adoption into their professional cadre immediately after graduation with a lot of fanfare and cheers.
In the second year of engineering studies, the undergraduate engineer is taught that, engineering regulations in Nigeria does not permit him to bear the title ‘’Engr” after graduation until at least 5years, then he can sit for an exam - if recommended by Nigerian Society of Engineers(NSE). If he passes the exam, then he qualifies to practice engineering with all privileges. Making it a total of 10years to become an engineer in Nigeria- yet there are no airplanes, ships, cars, machines built by a Nigerian engineer till today. When I asked, I was told that the idea is to reduce quackery and avoid the building of substandard structures – Yet there are substandard structures everywhere, and there are quacks everywhere too. But when I checked Medicine which deals directly with human life, this stringent condition does not apply. Even undergraduate medical doctors attain to patients in the clinic- that is why they have university teaching hospital. In law, which deals with justice, this undue strictness does not also apply, everyone knows that there are incompetent lawyers and judges everywhere in Nigeria- that is why there is Appeal to cases and judgements.
I, Graduate Engineer Abbah Rufus, on behalf of all concerned undergraduate and graduate engineers in Nigeria, make the following suggestions, submission, appeal, or demands as the case may be, to the Nigerian Government:
1. COREN should be reformed immediately to allow immediate adoption of graduate engineers into the engineering profession with all privileges, either automatically or with lesser conditions.
2. The national Assembly should initiate a bill to make a law that will establish Engineering Institute, that will be regulated by COREN. This institute will have the responsibility to prepare the graduate engineer for professionalism.
3. There should be Engineer General of the Federation. Who is to among other functions, be the Chief Adviser to the government on Engineering, Technology and Industry issues.  Just like there is Attorney General of the Federation, Auditor General of the Federation, Accountant General of the Federation, and surveyor General of the Federation.
4. Government should ensure that credit from Bank of Industries is given to engineers with minimal or zero interest rate, to encourage engineering, and National Industrialization.
5. There should be an order of mandamus, from the office of the Engineer General of the Federation to companies operating in Nigeria to as a matter of obligation, to engage undergraduate engineer during his period of internship to improve his engineering experience with stipend to offset the cost of his logistics.

From,
Graduate Engineer, Abbah Rufus.

Please Note:

If you are an undergraduate engineer,
 graduate engineer, or you like engineering.
 Help me share this piece until it gets to the government.

The maiden edition of the South East/South South pre-season tournament has come and gone with our beloved team Fc Ifeanyi Ubah; "The Anambra Warriors" clinching the trophy in grand style.

On this historic feat achieved, the team has, one again, proven their mettle, strength and determination as warriors. I gladly appreciate the team's spirited effort, cooperation, coordination, hard work, tenacity and team work which yielded this excellent performance.

I'm proud of you all for a job well done. As your hard work has truly paid off in this project, we look forward to achieving a landmark success in the 2017/2018 NPFL season. Congratulations!

I wish to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who worked towards the actualization and success of this tournament. May I also use this medium to thank High Chief Emeka Inyama for initiating this project which, I, gladly accepted to host, Mr Patrick Ngwaogu, who coordinated the tournament, ensuring its eventual success as well as the Chairman of FC Ifeanyi Ubah, Mr. Chukwuma Ubah who saw to it that the visiting teams were taken care of in the most hospitable manner. Kudos!

To all the football teams that participated in this South East/South South tournament, I wish to assure you all of our resolve to ensure the continuity of this event while we work assiduously towards improving on areas of identified challenges during the just concluded maiden edition.

I cannot conclude without identifying with our esteemed journalists for the kind role they played throughout the tournament. You all have been a sturdy pillar of support to the Nigerian league.

Finally, I wish to heartily congratulate the Management, team and supporters of FC IfeanyiUbah for this success. Let's go make history in the coming season!

Anyi bu ndi mmeri!

Signed:

Dr. Patrick Ifeanyi Ubah
President FC Ifeanyi Ubah.

13/12/2017, 23:12 - +234 809 471 9236: *STATE OF THE NATION*

I have been following closely the activities of this government and whenever I have the opportunity, I try to find out the opinions of people as regards the performance of this government. 

I just realized that the hardship faced by many Nigerians is simply as a result of the fact that almost everyone of us benefited from the cycle of corruption. 

The bricklayer, plumber, laborers, tiler are all complaining because building construction has slowed down massively cause the thieves no longer have money to spend on real estate. 

The car dealers are grumbling because their cars are begging for buyers. Thieves can no longer spend wastefully. 

The private school owners are shouting because parents can no longer pay outrageous sums and are withdrawing their wards. 

I was shocked when I learnt that in a popular private University in Abuja, parents are writing undertaking at the account section for their children to be allowed to write exams... and it goes on and on.

The fact is, a lot of people are returning to what someone referred to as ''default mode''.

We mostly have been living above our REAL MEANS. 

We have been staying in houses that ordinarily our incomes can't afford. 

Our children going to schools we can't afford. Driving cars we ordinarily can't maintain.

We have been living a FAKE LIFE all along. Now the reality is before us and we don't want to accept it. 

This shows how morally bankrupt we are.

You can't eat your Cake and have it. Take Note..."GOD HELP AND BLESS NIGERIA"

You got billions from bank without collateral using your political influence. You put half into your business and spent the other half on exotic cars, jeweleries, etc. 

Your business employs 100 people normally. You get illegal waivers and concessions to import raw materials at rock bottom prices, you get over-inflated contract to supply government some goods your company produce....in short your company is kept afloat by corruption.

Now the new SHERIFF in town says: 

no more ridiculous waivers, 
no more inflated contracts, no more bank loans without collateral, in fact its time you or your company pay off the billions of debt owed.....

AMCON takes over your company, staff are laid off......And you go on air and say the new sheriff is killing business and causing unemployment..

The truth is....you and your company were never in business, you were only feeding off the system. 

Too many companies and banks are funded by corruption. Remove corruption from the system and they collapse.......and we end up blaming the person that removes corruption for the collapse of the corruptly run fake company.

Its like our system and corruption are so interwoven and inseparable that removing one will kill the other. 

Maybe we should tolerate and learn to live with corruption so that Nigeria can survive? 

Recession: What recession? If you think Nigeria is broke, then you are living in another planet. Now, please read the information below and tell me why Nigerians crying of hardship are comfortable with the bold looting of their collective wealth by the politicians. 

A SELF DECEIVING COUNTRY CALLED NIGERIA 

Twenty-one senators currently receiving pensions from government as ex-governors and deputy governors.

The current senators who once served as governors are Bukola Saraki of Kwara, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of Kano, Kabiru Gaya of Kano, Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom, Theodore Orji of Abia, Abdullahi Adamu of Nasarawa, Sam Egwu of Ebonyi, Shaaba Lafiagi of Kwara, Joshua Dariye of Plateau Jonah Jang of Plateau, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko of Sokoto, Ahmed Sani Yarima of Zamfara, Danjuma Goje of Gombe, Bukar Abba Ibrahim of Yobe, Adamu Aliero of Kebbi, George Akume of Benue and Isiaka Adeleke of Osun. 

The  former deputy governors in the Senate are Ms Biodun Olujimi of Ekiti and Enyinaya Harcourt Abaribe of Abia. Danladi Abubakar Sani served as the acting governor of Taraba state.

Many former governors are also in Buhari's Cabinet as Ministers. This includes: Ngige, Fayemi, Amaechi and Fashola (SAN).).

In Akwa Ibom State, the law provides that ex governors and deputy governors receive pension equivalent to the salaries of the incumbent. The package also includes a new official car and a utility vehicle every four years; one personal aide; a cook, chauffeurs and security guards for the governor at a sum not exceeding N5 million per month and N2.5 million for his deputy governor.

In Rivers, the law provides 100 percent of annual basic salaries for the ex-governor and deputy, one residential house for the former governor “anywhere of his choice in Nigeria”; one residential house anywhere in Rivers for the deputy, three cars for the ex-governor every four years and two cars for the deputy every four years. 

It is alledged that in Lagos, a former governor will get two houses, one in Lagos and another in Abuja, estimated at N500 million in Lagos and N700 million in Abuja. He also receives six new cars to be replaced every three years; a furniture allowance of 300 percent of annual salary to be paid every two years, and a N30 million pension annually for life.

This is the reality for all the 21 ex govenors and deputy governors who are currently serving as senators. This same is also true of ex governors who are now serving as Ministers.

NOW I ASK: 
How many years did these guys serve their states as governors and deputy governors? Is it more than 8years? Is that a reason to be entitled to pensions for life? Even if they are entitled to pension for life, must it be so outrageous?

As if that is not enough: HOW on earth can any public servant with conscience collect salaries and allowances as a senator or minister, and still have the audacity to claim pensions equivalent to the salaries of a serving governor in Nigeria?

IT ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE......

Once you are elected a senator or appointed a minister, you must forfeit any pension accruing to you from government at any level until you vacate office. This should also apply to senators collecting military pensions like former Senate President David Mark.

Yet these senators are in the Senate that is inviting the current finance minister to discuss the recession of Nigeria's economy. A senator pockets approximately 30 million naira monthly as salary and allowances. Our "honourables" are not interested to make laws that could restructure our country into economically autonomous federating States/Regions to save the country from sectional agitations that is threatening  to destroy Nigeria. The sad and hopeless situation is that the rest of Nigerians are busy arguing based on party, ethnic and affiliations while these enemies of state continue to rape us.

Do you know that it costs tax payers 290m Naira yearly to maintain each member of our National Assembly in a country where nothing works & 80% of population earn below 300 Naira a day ? A working day earning of a senator is more than a yearly income of a doctor; it's more than the salary of 42 Army generals or 48 professors or 70 commissioners of police or more than twice the pay of the US President or 9 times the salary of US congressmen. 

It's high time the country had a referendum on those outrageous salaries of Senators, House of Representative members and other political office holders.

*If you are seriously against the looting of our commonwealth in Nigeria, in the name of democracy, you can let this piece go viral by sharing it with as many of your contacts and groups too!*

##FORWARDED AS RECEIVED
14/12/2017, 07:08 - Ipe Phyno: Take a bank for example, they sell a package which pays back 40% profit if you put $60 in your account, so more like you borrow a bank your $60 and you guys have an agreement that you will be lending the bank your $60 for 140 working days and the bank agrees that they will pay you back your $60 plus 40% profit in these 140 days, so they agree to pay you 1% profit back every working day for 140 days.  (Which makes the investment a 140% return on investment. Your 100% is your $60 back to you and the 40% is the profit you get)
And the good thing is that you can buy as much packages as you want, so you can have 10-20 packages, each paying you back 140% so you can imagine how much profit you can make with buying more packages. 
And the sweetest part is that you get paid all of these in bitcoin, so when bitcoin prices go up in the market you get more 1% interest daily.  And at the end you sell off all these bitcoin at whatever current selling price of bitcoin in the market at that period.
14/12/2017, 07:08 - Ipe Phyno: And not just that, every time you recommend someone and they buy a package you get an additional 10% from their package, which is 10% of $60,  you get $6 each time they buy a package.  And remember, all in bitcois. 
The bank in this question is USI-TECH, which is a bitcoin mining company. Authentic. You may confirm. Bitcoin miners get paid to mine bitcoin and process transactions.

They are those crop of leaders who possess the capacity and ability to identify the need and direction of a desired change. This desired change consequently forms an inspiring vision. To actualize this vision, a transformational leader banks on motivating others, instilling in them the belief and confidence needed to secure the grail."

23/12/2017, 06:42 - Ipe Jennifer: Today, is the day of the Lord for those who believes... Amen!!!

Beloved, this morning I pray that God will water your ground and your trees shall bear its fruits bountifully in due season.

There shall be no scarcity of good things in your life by the mercy of God. Till drought ended in the land of Israel, Elijah didn't suffer or starved once because God used ravens and a widow to feed him.

 I pray for you today, that at this crucial time, the Lord will feed and satisfy you and your family with good things.
 
The blood of Jesus will speak deliverance and breakthrough for you and your family in Jesus name, Amen.

Good morning, it's another day of God's
blessings. Stand/abide in His Grace. 

Shalom!

Christmas is a time to cherish those who bring good tidings and blessings to our lives, a time for giving and sharing, a time of loving and forgiving. Christmas is a time to touch every heart with love and care, a time where we conspire with the miracle of Christ's birth to gladden the hearts of all those around us.

As my family and I join you, your family and millions of Christians around the world to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, may the glorious message of love fill your hearts with peace and lasting happiness; and may the salvation that follows His birth overwhelm you in all your pursuits with abundant grace and divine favour.

In the spirit of the yuletide, let us endeavour to spread the warmth and love of the Christmas season to all those around us, especially the needy and less privileged amongst us remembering that He, whose birth we celebrate today commanded us to always show love to them.

While we celebrate the miracle of Christmas and count the days until the start of a new year, it is my earnest prayer that the pleasures and treasures of Christmas bring forth a fitting ending to a rather eventful 2017 as we look forward to the herald of a new year with fresh hopes of a bright beginning for a better tomorrow and a greater Nigeria.

Merry Christmas and wishes of a prosperous 2018 to you and your family.

From Dr. and Mrs. Dr. Patrick Ifeanyi Ubah

 Lev 13:1-2,44-46.
1Cor 10:31-11:1.
 Gospel mk 1:40-45
SPIRITUAL LEPROSY, THE DISEASE OF OUR GENERATION 

Every liturgical celebration is a healing encounter with God. Our generation has been infected with spiritual leprosy. Sin is a kind of leprosy that has become the culture of the children of God. Leprosy is a contagious disease that makes one unclean. Who is suffering from leprosy is tagged with stigma.

Christians of our time are suffering from spiritual leprosy. They are alienated from the presence of God because of the odour of their sin. They are uncomfortable in the presence of holy people because their lives is untouched by the gospel. They are smelling spiritually. They infect others with this wicked disease. 

Nowadays, many families are infected by the disease of the spiritual leprosy. Our country is is suffering from spiritual leprosy. Children of God are suffering from this problem. Some of you are already comfortable in this kind of leprosy. 

We are admonished to identify the level of spiritual leprosy eating our spiritual treasuries and approach Jesus for forgiveness, healing and deliverance. Jesus has given us hope today. He is inviting you to have a healing encounter with him. Come close to Jesus, he will heal you. Come close to Jesus, he will deliver you. Come close to Jesus, he will forgive you. I urge you my beloved friends to keep away from worldly desires that wage war against your soul '(1 Peter 2:11).

30/03/2018, 21:23 - IPE OGE: Do you still remember those awkward days in schools during Exams ?

When a bright student tells the invigilator that question 4 has a problem, but you have already answered it...😳😜

When a fellow student asks for a graph paper, but you are finished and did not see anywhere where it was required...😧 😁😁

When the invigilator says jump question 6 we will rectify it later, but it was the question you enjoyed most when answering...😟 😱😲

When you see people busy using rulers and you are wondering what is going on...😣😫😫

When you hear your friends arguing after the exam whether the answer to question 5 was 35.5% or 36.5% and your answer was 1800 😩😏

The cream. When the other students asked for 4-5 additional answer sheets and You had two pages empty in the main answer sheet😨😰😱

See where you have reached in life inspite of those moments...things are not permanent...enjoy life! 😃😃

Only for those who enjoyed their school life😂😂😂

I'm sure that the last line made all of you remember and smile .
This was our school days. 
The best part was that we used to have the most innocent face to show at that point..😂😂

08/04/2018, 06:44 - Ipe Jennifer: *WHAT IS MATURITY?*
I used to think that maturity was about age and physical development, how wrong I was. I have since found out that age is only but a number, below are 20 definitions of *MATURITY* 
*-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-*
1.... *Maturity* is when you accept other people the way they are and their level of maturity.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
2.... *Maturity* is when you understand that your ideas are not always the best.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
3.... *Maturity* is when you learn to let go even if it pains.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
4... *Maturity* is when you are able to drop expectations from a relationship and give for giving sake.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
5.... *Maturity* is when you understand that whatever positive things you do, you do for your own peace.
*-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
6... *Maturity* is when you stop proving to the world how RIGHT OR SUPERIOR you are.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
7.... *Maturity* is when you stop comparing yourself with others because life is not a competition.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-*
8.... *Maturity* is when you understand that you can't and shouldn't always get what you want every time.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
9.... *Maturity* is when you are contented and satisfied with your life and yet aspiring to be better everyday..
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
10.... *Maturity* is when someone hurt you and you understand their attitude and stay clear, rather than trying to hurt them back.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
11.... *Maturity* is when you start thinking about other people and not just yourself.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
12.... *Maturity* is when you know you cant please everyone.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
13.... *Maturity* is when you see things in different perspectives - far beyond the way they seem.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
14.... *Maturity* is when you love more and judge less.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
15.... *Maturity* is responsibility
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
16.... *Maturity* is Love
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
17.... *Maturity* is the application of wisdom and knowledge in humility..
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
18... *Maturity* is when you accept that your accomplishment, failures, destiny, reputations and virtually everything about your life depends on God's will and the choices you make and not pointing fingers at others.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
19... *Maturity* is when someone hates you and you still pray for them to succeed.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
20.... *Maturity* is knowing God, serving Him with all that you've got and pursuing His Kingdom no matter what people think or say...
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*

10/04/2018, 20:26 - Ipe LeboSmart: Just go to any government hospital, tell them you want to do a fitness test for your Nysc camping. Your blood sample would be collected and several test would be carried out based on how sophisticated the hospital is and the availability of resources. Just collect any result given to you (signed and stamped), nysc would acknowledge once it is a government hospital. 
Don't bother yourself much on the processes.

According to a source who is a staff of NYSC and asked not to be disclosed, a new date has been set for the 2018 batch A orientation camp. This is due to the fact that government does not to pay allowance for two sets of batch A, stream 1, in April. Thus is due to the fact that, the recently passed out batch A, stream 1 ,2017 will still collect allowance for this month of April. Thus, a new date of 24 April has been set for batch A stream 1 , 2018. This will make them be able to pay May allowance in camp and avoid April double payment. 2018 batch A ,stream 1 will be able to print call up letters by Thursday 19 of April , 2018. Akin Adeboye, reporting for Nysc newspaper.

15/04/2018, 19:16 - IPE Harrison: A man was crying and someone asked him why he was crying. And he said I have only one son, I have done all my possible best to educate him so that he will be a great person and by God's grace he has been able to acquire all certificates including:
￼🌺 G.C.E
￼🌺 W.A.E.C
￼🌺 Bachelor's
￼🌺 MSc
￼🌺 Phd 
BUT
Unfortunately he fell sick and doctors said they can't do anything about it and the only option is to die in the next 30 minutes and my son told me to bring all his certificates and I brought them. All he could say was; father, these are my degrees but you never told me to study my Bible. I don't know what I'm going to tell God.

17/04/2018, 18:26 - Ipe Jennifer: I love this, read it:

😰A King had a male servant who, in all circumstances always said to him; My king, do not be discouraged because everything God does is perfect, no mistakes. One day, they went hunting and a wild animal attacked the king, the servant managed to kill the animal but couldn't prevent his majesty from losing a finger. Furious and without showing gratitude, the King said; if God was good, I would not have been attacked and lost one finger. The servant replied, 'despite all these things, I can only tell you that God is good and everything He does is perfect, He is never wrong'. Outraged by the response, the king ordered the arrest of his servant. While being taken to prison, he told the king again, God is Good & Perfect. Another day, the king left alone for another hunt and was captured by savages who use human beings for sacrifice. On the altar, the savages found out that the king didn't have one finger in place, he was released because he was considered not "complete" to be offered to the gods. On his return to the palace, he ordered the release of his servant and said; My friend, God was really good to me. I was almost killed but for lack of a single finger, I was let go. But I have a question; If God is so good, why did He allow me to put you in prison? His servant replied; My king, if I had not been put in prison, I would have gone with you, and would have been sacrificed, because I have no missing finger. Everything God does is perfect, He is never wrong. Often we complain about life, and the negative things that happen to us, forgetting that everything happens for a purpose. God knows why you are reading this message today, please bless someone with it by sharing it. God is good and perfect!! My dear friend, a good attitude will determine your altitude. When you look at your life, career, job or family life, what do you say? Do you praise God? Do you blame the Satan? A good attitude towards God makes Him move on your behalf. Just sit down and say, Today , I am thankful I had a peaceful sleep, I am thankful I am alive with possibilities, I am thankful I have a roof over me, I am thankful I have a job, I am thankful that I have Family and Friends. Above all, I am thankful that I have God in my life . Be blessed and don't be envious or shocked when others are prospering because you don't know what they have been through to get there (test, trials and tribulation) so thank God for what you have. "Little is much when God is in it. It Is Well With God's grace. Touch someones life with this message if God is for us, who can be against us? Don't read if you can't forward. God has seen you struggling with something. God says it's over. A blessing is coming your way. If you believe in God send this message on, please don't ignore it, God is going to fix two things (BIG) in your favor. If you believe in God, drop everything and pass it on. Today will be the best day of your life. Send this to everybody in your contacts.

18/05/2018, 19:27 - Ipe LeboSmart: A guy slept off while
waiting for
his roommate, he
keeps late
night. As he tried
turning around,
a huge dark figure with
flamy
eyes opened his door,
he wanted
to scream but all
strength was
gone. Was it a dream or
vision?
He cant tell. It stared
deep into
his eyes and handed
him a
letter, he opened it.......
Dear Jude,
I couldn't make it home
last night
because I died. I
thought life
after death is an
elusion but am
here lonely and afraid in
pains
and in
torments The torture
is
unending, I cant explain
it but
am dying a thousand
times in a
second.
You never told me this
place was
for real and
how to avoid it. We
grew up
together, went to
school
together and did
everything in
common but you never
told me
about this new life of
yours. I
asked you severally and
you
jokingly pushed it aside.
I was a
good man with a
charitable heart
but that didn't count
here. The
angel told me, am
without Christ
and my name is not in
the book
of life. I asked you
yesterday
morning whats this
born again
stuff and you said you
don't
want to bore me. Am in
pains,
can you hear the
screams, the
torments of the great
and the
less, I was told its for
eternity.
You betrayed our
friendship, you
never told me sex was
fornication but you
cautioned me
against AIDS, you never
told me
getting high was
drunkenness,
you just told me not to
drink and
drive, you never told me
lying
was sin, all you just
said was
don't be caught. I hate
you for
this....aaaahhh
h.....aaahhhh....aaa am
dying
again here but am alive,
the
flames keeps getting
hotter. I
wish you were here.
You
deceived me to the end.
If you
had told me about
Jesus and
salvation I knew I
couldn't be
here. I died only a few
hours ago,
I was drunk and ran
into a pole
but it seems I have
been here for
years.
Please tell my family
and all our
friends about salvation.
Am dying
again but death wont
come.
Its me, Henry.
He woke up at about
2:45AM
with a banging
headache and his phone
started
ringing, he picked it up
and what
he heard scared him to
his
bones. "Hello, Henry is
dead".
Today is still another
opportunity
to tell someone very
dear to you
about Jesus Christ and
His saving
grace. I just told you
because I
will never want you to
end up in
HELL.
HAVE YOU TOLD
SOMEONE ABOUT
JESUS TODAY?
U can copy, share and
paste in
other group chats
please. God
will help us in this race
in the
mighty name of Jesus.... 

You might not be able to go around evangelising but you can just share this to caution someone. Do it if you want to.

08/08/2018, 19:59 - IPE IKEOLUWA: Before King Ahmed of Ottoman went to war, he locked his wife (the beautiful Queen) in a private room and gave the key to his best friend Mousa and said: "If I'm not back in four days, open the room and she's yours ... "

He climbed on his horse and gallops off towards the battlefield. Half an hour later, the King noticed a cloud of dust behind him. He stopped and saw his friend galloping very fast towards him.

"What's wrong ?" Asked the King. Out of breath, his friend Mousa responded: "You gave me the wrong key"

😳😳😳😳😳 What????

can you imagine 😳

He didn't even wait for the said 4days before trying the keys 😳😳😳😳

Be careful with the one you consider your best "friends" and whom you think you can entrust them with your hard earned treasure - they could be wishing you dead soon and hopefully inherit your God-given fortune!
