7/15/18, 2:48 PM - Harsha Tummala: I have no interest in poking into those matters
7/15/18, 2:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh i knoe the drama
7/15/18, 2:48 PM - Jenit Jain: lol
7/15/18, 2:48 PM - Jenit Jain: i caused it
7/15/18, 2:48 PM - Harsha Tummala: Then tell
7/15/18, 2:49 PM - Harsha Tummala: XD
7/15/18, 2:51 PM - Jenit Jain: In short, dikshita and i have been INDIRECTLY chucked out of the nethraa sriya and their group. Like nethraa and agrim are against us completely, divya and pranav are very neutral, and all the other girls are inclined to nethraa's side (by inclined i mean they probably dont give a shit about me which is fine but they still might talk to dikshita hopefully) and I also dont give 2 shits about parth and saurak.
7/15/18, 2:52 PM - Harsha Tummala: Why is all this happening?
7/15/18, 2:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Nethraa is a cocky (in general), tormenting (towards dikshita) and hypocritical (towards EVERYTHING) cunt who doesn't accept her mistake, and while i was trying to explain her everything and sort everything out she just couldn't understand jack shit and according to her nothing she did was wrong. And since she is kinda the *boss* of the group, no one else had the balls to confront her (eventhough most of them agreed about the above mentioned things till an extend). So after the discussion, which was useless, things went south. Agrim is her bf so obviously he'll be on her side, so saurak, nethraa and agrim left the whatsapp group and made another one with everyone from the old group except dikshita and i
7/15/18, 3:00 PM - Harsha Tummala: Goddamn
7/15/18, 3:01 PM - Harsha Tummala: Why would you want to confront her all of a sudden?
7/15/18, 3:04 PM - Jenit Jain: I was hearing thing from months before that were just too shallow, and she was tormenting dikshita like crazy, like dikshita didn't even wanna room up with her for even 1 more month but dikshita is the complaining kind so she assumed that everything was fine. so dikshita dealt with her part, and i was trying to make her realise what she did (not related to dikshita) was very wrong and that she needed to apologise to the concerned people and also sort the stuff we had between us so that atleast we could still stay friends
7/15/18, 3:13 PM - Jenit Jain: the point for all this gossip was, no i dont have any plans to go to some hill station or something the coming weekend )
7/15/18, 3:13 PM - Jenit Jain: :)
7/15/18, 3:15 PM - Harsha Tummala: Woah, I don't want to comment on anything. But just keep your ground
7/15/18, 3:17 PM - Jenit Jain: keep your ground matlab

4/23/19, 12:01 AM - Harsha Tummala: Thankssss
4/23/19, 12:01 AM - Harsha Tummala: Dudeee
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Harsha Tummala: For stock turnover ratio
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Harsha Tummala: The numerator is cost of goods sold
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Harsha Tummala: It's not net sales
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Jenit Jain: To use cost of good you also need opening stock which isn't giving so that's why using net sales/ closing inventory
4/23/19, 12:03 AM - Jenit Jain: CA has solved all this so just accept and decode. Notthing is wrong in this
4/23/19, 12:03 AM - Jenit Jain: Except that you can add preference captial in shareholders equity
4/23/19, 12:03 AM - Harsha Tummala: That is cool
4/23/19, 12:03 AM - Harsha Tummala: But I mean, we are in a fix na....will the humanities guys accept it?
4/23/19, 12:04 AM - Harsha Tummala: <Media omitted>
4/23/19, 12:04 AM - Harsha Tummala: Tell me the cost of goods sold in this plis
4/23/19, 12:04 AM - Jenit Jain: Refer to the formula sheet. It has the break up for all these formula
4/23/19, 12:04 AM - Harsha Tummala: Just this one part
4/23/19, 12:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Cash purchases?
4/23/19, 12:06 AM - Harsha Tummala: Can we use sales/ closing inventory here also?
4/23/19, 12:06 AM - Harsha Tummala: No idea what that is
4/23/19, 12:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes
4/23/19, 12:06 AM - Jenit Jain: It's given in the question
4/23/19, 12:06 AM - Harsha Tummala: I think it's manufacturing expenses
4/23/19, 12:08 AM - Harsha Tummala: Basically purchases
4/23/19, 12:09 AM - Harsha Tummala: But the only problem is, if I do opening stocks in trade + purchases - closing stocks
4/23/19, 12:10 AM - Harsha Tummala: It doesn't satisfy the part that says gross profit = net sales - cost of goods sold
4/23/19, 12:13 AM - Jenit Jain: Cost of goods is 96000 + (138000-18000) - 144000
4/23/19, 12:13 AM - Harsha Tummala: ye cool
4/23/19, 12:14 AM - Harsha Tummala: what about this?
4/23/19, 12:15 AM - Jenit Jain: So it might have made a loss?
4/23/19, 12:15 AM - Harsha Tummala: could be
4/23/19, 12:15 AM - Harsha Tummala: no idea
4/23/19, 12:15 AM - Jenit Jain: No but it's written gross profit is 1.5L
4/23/19, 12:16 AM - Harsha Tummala: and net sale is 1.5L - 6k
4/23/19, 12:16 AM - Harsha Tummala: it is coming -ve that way
4/23/19, 12:18 AM - Jenit Jain: No clue
4/23/19, 12:20 AM - Harsha Tummala: dude
4/23/19, 12:20 AM - Harsha Tummala: rate of gross profit/100
4/23/19, 12:20 AM - Harsha Tummala: is the stock turnover ratio
4/23/19, 12:21 AM - Jenit Jain: Is it a formula
4/23/19, 12:22 AM - Harsha Tummala: no no
4/23/19, 12:22 AM - Harsha Tummala: shit
4/23/19, 12:23 AM - Harsha Tummala: (net sales - gross profit)/net sales = rate of gross profit
4/23/19, 12:24 AM - Jenit Jain: Ohh gg
4/23/19, 12:30 AM - Harsha Tummala: what is average inventories in this case
4/23/19, 12:30 AM - Jenit Jain: (96000+144000)/2
4/23/19, 12:31 AM - Harsha Tummala: shouldnt we add the cost of building also
