Its taking me over, like the moon in an eclipse
I don't understand it,
But what's done is done
Now;
Drowning in silence there is nothing left for you and me except us
They left us alone with a love we are blind they don't see
Where you are.  Is where I'll be
Where you are,    is home to me

11/11/20, 8:15 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: You are? 
Well... No need.. 
It's not like they interview to know if you will get it.. 
Everyone is already in.. 
They just want to know you more..
11/11/20, 8:15 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Like 20 mins or so
11/11/20, 8:16 AM - Bett: I feel like they'll attack how my hair looks😂
Then I'll just be silent or I'll give them a lecture before calling the interview off.
11/11/20, 8:16 AM - Bett: That's reassuring
11/11/20, 8:17 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: You are definitely over thinking.. 
Haha.. 
How is your hair? 

Give them a lecture? 
Oh come oon
11/11/20, 8:19 AM - Bett: Fr though... I hate it when people generalise peoples attributes under one terming it "first impression"
11/11/20, 8:19 AM - Bett: I hope I'm over thinking😂😂
11/11/20, 8:21 AM - Bett: How ready are you for the cat
11/11/20, 8:24 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: I'm. Okay.. 
Can't really say well prepared.. 
But he's saying it will be at 6pm. 

6pm
Imagine. 😂
11/11/20, 8:28 AM - Bett: That's just enough time to create doubt 😂😂😂
11/11/20, 8:28 AM - Bett: But seriously... 6pm is just far
11/11/20, 8:30 AM - Bett: So imagine I've written six reports since arriving alafu ati they won't be collected this week😂😂
I feel wasted😂
11/11/20, 8:34 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: 😂😂when will they be collected..
11/11/20, 8:34 AM - Bett: After exams😂
11/11/20, 8:35 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Well... At least you are already done with it, off your list.. 

That's good..
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: CAT is next week..
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - Bett: I wanted to tell you about stg I learnt from elon musk
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - Bett: Wait... Hii ya six?
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Yes please
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - Bett: Sth*
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - Bett: About time management... Or as he calls it, time boxing
11/11/20, 8:36 AM - Bett: You know about it already?
11/11/20, 8:37 AM - Bett: Yk, so I don't repeat it😂
11/11/20, 8:37 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Yes.. 
It was meant to be during this class.. 

Then he pushed it to six.. 
Guys complained... 
.

Now it's next week
11/11/20, 8:37 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: No no.. 
😂😂
Don't think I do..
11/11/20, 8:37 AM - Bett: So is it a yeeeey or "na vile nilisoma"😂😂
11/11/20, 8:38 AM - Bett: Ow that's great
11/11/20, 8:38 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: 😂😂
11/11/20, 8:41 AM - Bett: So he says in the morning you should know what you are yo do in the day. So you put them in time boxes with specified time limits... So if say you got a class, then studies then taking care of your bro...
Just allocate time sufficient to do it.. Then have an extra time box with no activity... So that should sth come that requires you to attend to it, you just use that box
11/11/20, 8:45 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Remember the productivity book I told yah... 
Calls it creating a time log.. 
Like keeping track of how to spend each hour of your day for let's say a week. Then you see patterns and how sometimes you waste time on non valuable things... 


I think it relates with what you have said. 

We should try it right? Wait, I know you already doing it..
11/11/20, 8:46 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: I even have an excel sheet I downloaded from the book's website...i will send you..
11/11/20, 8:47 AM - Bett: Yeah I'm doing it...
11/11/20, 8:47 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: I think one challenge I have is my brother ain't that much predictable.. 
He can decline sleeping when he usually is supposed to hence shift in schedules..
11/11/20, 8:48 AM - Bett: Please do. It will really help is...

#notmytimewasting😂
11/11/20, 8:48 AM - Bett: That's where the extra time box comes in...
11/11/20, 8:48 AM - Bett: Us*
11/11/20, 8:48 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Ryt
11/11/20, 8:49 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: So now this time you have it set under  chatting ? I am in a schedule. 😂😂

And here I am multi tasking ..
11/11/20, 8:51 AM - Bett: No... Its not under chatting. I'm writing abstracts for the reports I've written...
11/11/20, 8:51 AM - Bett: I'm also texting you coz I like it when your name pops at the top of my screen
11/11/20, 8:55 AM - Bett: Also because the time I set for texting, you're usually reading... So I multitask when you're free on rather online
11/11/20, 9:31 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: ❤️
What  is your texting time..
11/11/20, 9:32 AM - Bett: 9+

11/11/20, 9:34 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: 9+

11/11/20, 9:34 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: It wasn't..

And one of the requirements was to briefly write one's vision as 40.. 

You know what.. 
😂😂
Of course at 40 I'd be married and as I was describing that life one could easily tell I already knew who my husband was.. 😂😂
I kept laughing.. 

Like I talked about the homeschooling, then the kind of lifestyle I will have.. I was mentioning my husband's machine companies and how we will both teach our children.. 
.
Then I remembered, a person readings this will easily get confused.. I mean. She is already dictating what Her husband will or will not do.. 

😂😂😂

It's like I was effortlessly owning your vision.. 


Of course I had to re adjust the whole thing..

11/12/20, 10:19 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: I wanted to ask you to lead 😂

Okay love.. 
We do this 
We both text and send.. So we see the originality in everyone's thoughts..
11/12/20, 10:20 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: What 😂
11/12/20, 10:21 PM - Bett: Aight
11/12/20, 10:22 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: You Okay with that suggestion  or had a different opinion in mind..
11/12/20, 10:23 PM - Bett: I love the suggestion... I'm looking to go offline then type it out...
11/12/20, 10:24 PM - Bett: So we see how close our thoughts are
11/12/20, 10:53 PM - Bett: So let's start with accountability systems to help us get there...
Pros: I think we have to divide the goals into smaller steps towards achieving the whole stuff. For example if I want to create the shopping software, then the first procedure is learning several programing languages that'll be used there, then write an algorithm and pseudocode then finally the code.
So in the first step again, break it down to each programing language... In this case python, c# and c++ . give them timelines to complete them. So this small steps slowly lead us to the main goal... 
Also I feel like we( esp I ) need to work more on making my days productive so my nights are solely for my goals... And of course talking to you😂
Cons: how much time online... I think since this mostly makes us push our time limits, it's only necessary that we have our own rule of online presence( subject to not affect online research... Just social apps) I prefer we have our texts at the very end of our day to talk about our days without having to worry 'bout cat's the following day or assignments to be covered. So I guess we could discuss 'bout that time.
And about books... I really wanted you to give me your opinion here because up until bow I've been grabbing every book in my reach. Some turned out disastrous to my spiritual life... Some helped me back, some just gimme entertainment while a major bulk gimme ideas and knowledge (educational😂) so I was hoping you could help propose a way.
I honestly believe God is key in achieving our dreams... Not just the success of it, but on the more important part of remembering it is all for his glory. I've always believed that when God gave us a brain, he in a way gave our dreams to us. So you already a world class financial expert as I all the professions. All that's left to see is if we still will remember the one behind it all. So we should pray... Pray so he helps us stay true to our dreams and so that we remain strong in his name in the days to come.
I want to be your constant source of motivation Tehillah(was about to use Gracious... But Tehillah sounds more sweet in my head😂)
I want to be there when you strive to be who you want to be. I want to push you even further than you thought you would go.
11/12/20, 11:03 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Hiiii again.. 
😂

Aight so how do we help each other be the best they can be. 

*Spiritually*
One thing that should be very evident in our friendship has to be our genuinty and dependence on Christ.Like our centre core, something that affects how we deal with every other area of our lives.. Even how we talk.. 

To do this I suggest we all create and set aside a time where we seek God in prayer and reading his word.. Be very intentional, just like how we get overly worked out trying to suit all this productivity activities in our schedule.. 

So everyday I know, Bett had his time with God and you are assured I sure did too.. 

A day in a week we can alternate in explaining verses that caught our attention during our secret place sessions.. 


Apart from our own prayer lists, we can have common things that we all pray about and with time see how God carries us through each one.. 

*Educationally*
I feel this should be more of willingness each person has towards their performance.. 
But we can definitely encourage each other on.. 
Like through words, prayers, following up.. 

*Finances*
Well we all very focused people..
I feel we should start discussing on areas where we can start building our finance journey... Be it together or individually.. 
I have always wanted to have my own website with hosting writes and all.. I want to have a blog (niche still praying on)... Be a specialist on a subject and later have a faithful following that earns me traffic.. With time enroll for advertising privileges and have different organisations contact me to feature them due to the following I have.. 

I once did a loooooott of research on this.. Have my notes piled up... I just lacked time and a website.. 😂😂

A close way I guess to which we can start this is by taking on trading since we both have some bit of knowledge on the same.. 
We can start out and hopefully with time have it as a consistent source of income.. 

I think an online business is better..its cheap fast and requires little to no capital.. 

*Productivity*
The time blocks.. 
Definitely planning to set it up.. 
.
Also keeping a close eye on each other so we see if one is making any growth  in different areas and as individuals in general .A month in, two weeks etc and if not, call them on it.. 

Everday we mention three things that are our top priority for the day so by the end of the day hold each other accountable 


*Others*

Find ways to celebrate our small and big wins.. 
Even as we work on ourselves ,find time to look out for different ventures we know would benefit the other ..

Always strive to grow each day because now we know our actions by default affect the other person Too.. 

In our own way learn to appreciate the other.. 
Without a what do i get in return mindset... 

Find fun things to do.. 
We have to be holistically eqquipped 


Be open.. Even on things we find off about each other.. As soon as possible 

..
11/12/20, 11:04 PM - Bett: Hii
11/12/20, 11:05 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Taken me 30 mins to write.. 😂😂🙆🏼‍♀️
11/12/20, 11:07 PM - Bett: Couldn't agree more✨✨
11/12/20, 11:09 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: I felt yours was more of you centred than us..😂😂
But oh well.. 
Noted.. ✨
11/12/20, 11:10 PM - Bett: Esp on the last part... I never have someone to tell me where I go wrong( well, until you arrived😂)
I think it serves to make us better
11/12/20, 11:10 PM - Bett: Well I had to use examples I understand well...
I don't know much bout finance...
11/12/20, 11:12 PM - Bett: And I think it will open us to ideas... New world  where we grow with each passing moment
11/12/20, 11:12 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Haha.. Not really about that.. 
It's Okay.. 

I guess I will pray over it all.. We all should.. Then by morro hopefully I will create a a summarised and well planned report ..
11/12/20, 11:13 PM - Bett: Go on... Tell me
11/12/20, 11:13 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Whotchu mean
11/12/20, 11:14 PM - Bett: " not really about this "
11/12/20, 11:14 PM - Bett: 😊
11/12/20, 11:20 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Haha. Ryyt 
It was more of how you can get better and what you can do.. 

I never talked on finance as a school topic.. But as money.. 😂

And I think you were very formal on  that.. 
Even how you talk about many things.. 

It's always you just being this icon.. Which ain't bad.. And I think that fact is very attractive.. 
But too much of it can be very hard to cope with too..
11/12/20, 11:21 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Sorry if I made assumptions..
11/12/20, 11:22 PM - Bett: I am formal?😂
11/12/20, 11:23 PM - Bett: Can I like... Have another say... In the issue under discussion... Tomorrow morning?
11/12/20, 11:24 PM - Bett: I like actually... I get to fix stuff as we move on  ahead right?
11/12/20, 11:25 PM - Bett: It*
11/12/20, 11:28 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: We both are..
11/12/20, 11:28 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Absolutely ✨
11/12/20, 11:29 PM - Bett: Yeah... We both are
11/12/20, 11:29 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Still waking up at 5?
11/12/20, 11:30 PM - Bett: Thanks
11/12/20, 11:30 PM - Bett: Yeah... No signs of letting go soon
11/12/20, 11:30 PM - Bett: How 'bout you
11/12/20, 11:31 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Still wanna talk?
11/12/20, 11:31 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: I think I'm starting to feel really tired..

11/13/20, 5:39 AM - Bett: Gooodmorning
11/13/20, 5:59 AM - Bett: So I have been  thinking, since I already agree with all of your suggestions... Perhaps I'd just chip in with thoughts of how we would achieve that. ( if it's OK with you of course)
11/13/20, 6:00 AM - Bett: And going through it once again, its just evident that it needs to be a discussion... Since we have different to-do lists
11/13/20, 6:09 AM - Bett: When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love🎼
11/13/20, 6:13 AM - Bett: Daydreaming, with a smile on my face
Blissfully lost, in the sunniest of hues
Carelessly happy, oblivious to worries
Is what I’ve been, since I’ve met you
So surreal, everything has become
Life feels, too good to be true
My heart knows, this is just the beginning
Of a lot more to look forward to
11/13/20, 8:30 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: 😊
11/13/20, 8:32 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Hehe..

11/14/20, 7:40 PM - Bett: How's your day gone
11/14/20, 10:40 PM - Bett: In the calmness, in the chaos, in the silence, in the noise;
I remain awake waiting.
Waiting in great patience for earth to spin. Counting off days 
And in each wish, could see your long lost face
For I never see you out if dreams
Away from me you sleep, content in your heart
Away from you, broken dreams
Fragments of unrefined memories, hoping to find a way
In the chaos I try so hard, longing for you to light my way,
When I see light I open eyes, just to find its morning
In the calmness, silence of my thoughts stream, waiting in great patience, for the arrival of a dream
11/14/20, 11:03 PM - Bett: I guess you tired huh
Goodnight❤️

11/15/20, 5:52 AM - Bett: Yeaaah I'm really sorry... I remember opening the text, meaning to reply it then twas just 5:30am.
I know sounds crazy... Must have slept then.
I was just super tired. (Of course I wouldn't  just leave you in read. That's like running away from home... Where would I go?) .
11/15/20, 5:54 AM - Bett: What do you mean by trade
11/15/20, 5:54 AM - Bett: The forex trade?
11/15/20, 5:56 AM - Bett: What if its a choppy market at that time
11/15/20, 6:28 AM - Bett: I dreamt we were getting married... 
Then began everyday in a loop... I'd wake up see your face, find you looking at me... We would take turns with cooking breakfast though sometimes I'd do it more often coz you were preparing for a meeting ( my day was always spent in the house basement... Except when we would go out)
Then we had kids and the days shifted to a loop where we were ways playing with kids in the morning before you left for work after which I taught them... Sometimes I'd bring the kids to your firm for practicals😂( the firstborn knew what exactly she wanted... Just like you. The last born... Well, she wanted a little bit of everything. )
Then it shifted to the kids growing up and getting married. They had both started earning while doing the stuff they loved.
Then the loop reverted back to just you and me in the house... Then soon after our kids took over our companies and we had the whole days to ourselves. We began travelling. Did bungee jumping😂 and hot air balloons. Then I took you out to space once. Then we would go have conference talks... Well you were a known figure in the world. I was too, but only as your husband. No one really knew me past that. Because every part of invention I had was under my company... And well, the known figure in my company was the CEO I hired😂😂
Then we grew white hair, stopped going out much... Our kids would come visit once in a while(twas long loops actually) we had grandkids now( all super true to their beliefs... One kid particularly... Was just exactly like you. So twas quite obvious she was my favorite.
The loop went back to waking up beside you... Laughing while still in bed while having breakfast. We were increasingly growing old but you still had that glow. 
Then I just died. I don't recall how it happened... Or why, I just recall seeing you crying next to my casket
 Our kids giving a eulogy. Our friends talking about me. But it was you I was more focused on. You didn't talk, through the whole period till when I was cremated. I wanted to come back, twas better if I saw you talk. But no... Almost as if I felt that pain too.
11/15/20, 3:11 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Yes.. 
But will trade synthetic indices.. 
Forex is a little demanding.. 
Plus now I just wanna create systems for my trade.. 
Was hoping we'd do it together..
11/15/20, 3:18 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Hehe ❤️
11/15/20, 3:25 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Every time I was reminded to only date for the sole purpose of getting married I was like woah.. 
Makes sense, but thats a really boring life.. 

I mean.. 
You date yet know you will have this person for the rest of your life.. 
Monotonous. 
Boring.. 


Then you came.. And my whole thinking changed. 
Now I look forward to every conversation, because I know with you, I can never tire..

PS : I hope we all die at the same time, after that life I don't think I can bear even a mere  thought  of not having you around.. 

❤️


I wanna hug you and fool around rynow 😂❤️

My day. I had it planned to the second. Read, clean, sleep, read,eat.
Buuut this friend. Asked me to go with him to a rehab centre( yes, I am friends with drug addicts... ) so I did... Then I was asked to give a speech there and I did sth on psychological warfare. Then I talked to some of them then we played FIFA(I'll send a picture of how my best one was😂) then I talked to more guys(mostly girls😂) well they were the ones talking... I just sat and listened. Then I came home at five but I wanted to play chess... So I had a game and then stood at a line waiting for my chapos to be cooked(yeah that's my main meal on school... Also coz its the cheapest😂)

11/15/20, 11:30 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: It's one thing to make plans but yet another to exexute them. 
😂

Well.. 
I will take the first step. So I have put together what we talked about and.. 

On matters of spirituality, I will be sharing a verse  and my understanding on Mondays.. 
I do this week you can do the other (if willing) 
So I'll start Morro.. 

Also important to pray for each other earnestly.. 

Of course the enemy is aware of what we doing and he may want to frustrate us down the line by maybe getting us off consistency, breaking our friendship ,causing fail of plans etc hence constant war in the spirit is important.. 


on finances we can all set out and see areas where we can get income.. 
I for now have settled on trading(i don't know what you intend to do)
Then give ourselves a time limit. 
I propose 1st Dec we should all be having a source of income God willing or atleast working towards earning.. 


Books.. 
You had said something about picking the right books.. 
Well.. 
Before reading a book you could just send me the name I search it out..
11/15/20, 11:30 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Night do pray ❤️
11/16/20, 5:32 AM - Bett: Goodmorning❤️
11/16/20, 5:32 AM - Bett: How did you sleep
11/16/20, 5:42 AM - Bett: I was thinking after you do it on Mondays, I'll do mine on Friday so we both do it each week. And yes, I honestly do agree on the prayer part. 
Finances, trading... I agree with the trading part. But soon after we will have to get a stable one( I still don't think it'll get us a steady source of income).  So we could start of with trading, then continue to a more solid one. Currently I'm tryna find how market for clothes and FIFA are doing, um also focused on the time input.( because we tend to be highly intensive in time)
Thanks so much( about books). I guess I'll share them with you too..
PS: I was thinking you could tell me about three most important stuff you know you'll easily brush aside if sth else comes up, so I could yk, be a reminder so you don't have last minute's rush.
11/16/20, 8:22 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Good morning 
Had a great sleep.. 
Funny dream too.. 😂😂
But oh well 

You?
11/16/20, 8:33 AM - Bett: Funny dream😂😂
11/16/20, 8:33 AM - Bett: I slept well
11/16/20, 8:34 AM - Bett: I'm cooking break fast
11/16/20, 8:34 AM - T3#1||∆#❤: Psalms 119:73-74 

"your hands made me and formed me,give me understanding to learn your commands. 
May those who fear you rejoice when they see me, for I have put my hope in your word "


Such a powerful prayer David made.. 

He acknowledges that it is God who formed him hence that same God Is the one to give him understanding..he knew trusting his own wisdom and grasp even in the word of God would be foolish.. 
Plus he had developed such a great relationship with the lord he wouldn't imagine doing 
anything without the Lord.. 

David was *a man after God's own heart* 

Even as we strive to know him more, let's pray for understanding to learn his commands....that we may not walk in our own idea of wisdom and understanding, but in one he gives.. 


Doing this we will be a great source of encouragement even to our brothers and sisters in Christ. When they see us excel,stay firm, honor God even in the little things we do,obey his precepts, seek him and find his face, have him Favour us in everything we do... We ignite hope in them..
11/16/20, 8:55 AM - Bett: ✨thanks

There you go
11/16/20, 11:56 AM - Bett: Thanks a ton
11/16/20, 12:37 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Okay great.. 
Friday sounds cool 

Clothes, yeah, that can be great. 
I don't know much about FIFA 

For clothes.. 
Wanna sell them online or physically.. 
Could create a website where guys check out the clothes you (we 😂😌) have and their prices. 

Make orders so we retrieve them from the display till its delivered.. That will assure us a constant following and this customers will do marketing for us by having a constant, we customised website they can refer their friends to
11/16/20, 12:38 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Well customised #
11/16/20, 12:44 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: With time we can use this following we have gathered from this website to introduce people to different things we will have taken up alongside that. 

You know. 
Like having a you tube channel but now blogging. 

(this is exactly what I have always wanted to do with that blogging thing of mine)
11/16/20, 12:52 PM - Bett: Yeah... I will start working on the website after exams. Sth like jumia right?
11/16/20, 12:53 PM - Bett: Yeah that's sounds super cool
11/16/20, 12:54 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Yep ✨
11/16/20, 12:55 PM - Bett: What are you currently up to.

11/16/20, 12:55 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Strathmore business club is recruiting.. 
Been prayig about these positions.. 
What do you feel i should apply for..
11/16/20, 12:55 PM - Bett: You want to join?
11/16/20, 12:57 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Yes.. 
I have never joined any club.. 
Now I want to get out of my cocoon and join one..
Not even as a member but an official 😂😂

Was just a bit worried incase the position turns out to be demanding, considering the nature of my course..
11/16/20, 12:58 PM - Bett: No.5 
Though I feel like you'll be overloaded. I chose 5 coz it seems to be the less busiest of all.
But then again, you've a  liking for online platforms so 2. Buuut. Still wouldn't advise you to apply.
11/16/20, 12:59 PM - Bett: This is exactly what worries me. What if you can't handle all piled up responsibilities at once. I think there is a reason why people leave their former workplace if they are promoted
11/16/20, 1:00 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: I picked one and 5..

5 for that same reason 😂
The online thing, I feel like it will require me to be well aversed with instagram and the likes... Hehe not my thing..
11/16/20, 1:00 PM - Bett: I honestly don't know what 1 means😂😂 what does a person in that position do
11/16/20, 1:01 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: I we just about to ask you imagine 😂😂
11/16/20, 1:01 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Well i have some clue..

11/16/20, 1:04 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: I have come across that name often.. 
The HR department 

Waiiiit..

Okay Okay..
11/16/20, 1:06 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Helps the business gain a competitive advantage. It is designed to maximise employee performance ..
11/16/20, 1:07 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Okay.

11/16/20, 1:10 PM - Bett: So have you another title in mind?
11/16/20, 1:10 PM - Bett: Now we've struck off 1 and 2

11/16/20, 1:12 PM - Bett: Editorial executive... If the name is right then has to do sth with an editor...
11/16/20, 1:14 PM - Bett: That's a lot of reading and proof reading and lots of writing styles and work
11/16/20, 1:14 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Btw
You will show me how you use the YouTube premium thing to watch movies.. 
I have a craving for a good feisty business world movie..
Especially one with a boss lady.. Or some financial scam in a company.. 
😂
11/16/20, 1:14 PM - Bett: Its just similar to Netflix... Pay and watch
11/16/20, 1:15 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Ryyyt.. 
Should I really be running from these responsibilities.. 😂😂
Or I'm being wise.. 😂
11/16/20, 1:15 PM - Bett: Financial scam😂😂😂
There is this one I watched about wall street😂
11/16/20, 1:16 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Pay..?!

Of course..
11/16/20, 1:16 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Called..
11/16/20, 1:16 PM - Bett: I don't think its running if it'll affect your productivity ( trust me, unfinished assignments can really kill your motivation)
11/16/20, 1:17 PM - Bett: I don't recall right... I think twas just wall street😂
11/16/20, 1:17 PM - T3#1||∆#❤: Right right
