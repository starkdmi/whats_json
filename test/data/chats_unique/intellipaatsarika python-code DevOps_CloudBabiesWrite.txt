21/02/20, 4:36 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: what is the current usage of AWS Aurora in the industry? anyone actively using this service in the production environment or most of them are either on Oracle or MS-SQL or MariaDB for database option?
21/02/20, 4:40 pm - +91 99451 41141: Aurora is one of the fastest growing AWS services. It offers MySQL and postgress compatible solution at much higher performance
21/02/20, 4:41 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: yes, Sir!  but we want to know how is it gaining market coverage across the industry
21/02/20, 4:41 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Aurora performanance is great while it is expensive but anyone is able to afford this in the industry yet?
21/02/20, 4:58 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies removed +91 79934 46662

21/02/20, 5:27 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies:  wow la...looking like cash cow for AWS this service is I see some names
21/02/20, 5:27 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: what is your company name? keen to reveal here?
21/02/20, 5:27 pm - +91 99000 96546: Operative
21/02/20, 5:28 pm - +91 99000 96546: We are building a new product with microservices
21/02/20, 5:29 pm - +91 99000 96546: Depending on the requirements every microservice is using a different db
21/02/20, 5:29 pm - +91 99000 96546: We use redis, mongo aurora

21/02/20, 5:45 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: EDI to python to mulesoft is like searching for a coke in Sahara desert land 
21/02/20, 5:48 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: It seems they have SAP HR system that migrates to Workday.

21/02/20, 6:00 pm - +91 99451 41141: Last part is pretty simple just follow the web I shared step by step

21/02/20, 6:02 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Reposting Thursday video session 1
21/02/20, 6:02 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Session 2 on Sunday
21/02/20, 6:16 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: reflecting on what we learned on the other day sometime I wonder if Microsoft AD will still continue to lead in the enterprise world in the future
21/02/20, 6:17 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: for example if we see today the consumer to business segment or business to consumer segment either google or facebook based SSO authentication approach taking the market share
21/02/20, 6:18 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: whether these guys will also enter into business to business segment in the enterprise world that would be interesting to watch in the future and whether their SSO based features and MFA based features will see growth in the enterprise world if that happens then Microsoft definitely will loose market share
21/02/20, 6:19 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: today we as consumers when we login to all these consumer website all of them already integrated the google and faceback authenticator
21/02/20, 6:20 pm - +65 8381 5514: I think, still financial and critical org will continue to use sso
21/02/20, 6:20 pm - +65 8381 5514: At some time this might go to biometric & facial
21/02/20, 6:21 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: well biometric and facial already take place in the financial industry with big boys like BAML, GS, CITI, and in Asia DBS ...their transaction banking business already rolled out that feature to their clients
21/02/20, 6:23 pm - +65 8381 5514: Yes.. thats for consumers.
But Social authentication for internal organisation - may not be soon
21/02/20, 6:23 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Watch Okta... They are into something big.
21/02/20, 6:35 pm - +65 8381 5514: Interesting... 
thanks Lawrence !!!
You are awesome !! Got info on stone era of IT to next generation !! 
21/02/20, 6:43 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: <Media omitted>
21/02/20, 6:43 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: The company has been on loss for 3 years but stock price return is also 300% in the last three years
21/02/20, 6:49 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Any time Sir
21/02/20, 6:51 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Okta is working to build digital identity to every human in the world. The idea is also partially funded by US defense. If they succeed, we may not have terms such as social login, corporate login etc. Instead one global login to access various services including corporate network. Again, Microsoft and Google also works on the same idea. 

IMO, the login ID may become like www.
21/02/20, 6:54 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I agree
21/02/20, 6:57 pm - +65 8381 5514: Is there any way i can find what are the list of services/provisions under an account aws 
Its tedious process to find from
Web console
21/02/20, 6:58 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: try something like this aws2 ecs list-services
21/02/20, 6:58 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: from aws cli from your terminal
21/02/20, 7:18 pm - +91 99451 41141: Just look at the billing page
21/02/20, 7:22 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I plan to write Google Cloud Architect certification next month. Does anyone in this group have insights about it? I need some guidance before I appear. Thanks
21/02/20, 8:38 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: All the best!
21/02/20, 8:38 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Thanks, Joe
21/02/20, 8:47 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: AWS says the object size if it is > 5GB then the object need to split in 5GB size up to 5 TB. This doesn't go well with banking trade finance area. In the banking trade finance area the client documents which they submit to banks can be up to 10GB in that case if the bank ask its customers to split the documents into 5 GB size that's going to generate negative client experience .
21/02/20, 8:48 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I'm referring to S3 services
21/02/20, 9:22 pm - +1 (614) 589-7721: I doubt this is true. I constantly upload object more than 100g.
21/02/20, 9:23 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: u mean one single object overall size >=100 GB?
21/02/20, 9:24 pm - +1 (614) 589-7721: Yepp.
21/02/20, 9:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Q: How much data can I store in Amazon S3?

The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability.
21/02/20, 9:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: AWS S3 FAQ
21/02/20, 9:27 pm - +1 (614) 589-7721: I used sftp to upload the Oracle dumps of sizes 100G or more and it works just fine for me. The silver lining is the Single PUT. So the application will need to perform several PUT operations. Quote "As per the S3 request rate and performance guidelines, applications can now achieve "at least 3,500 PUT/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET requests per second", up from the former "300 PUT/LIST/DELETE requests per second or more than 800 GET requests per second"
21/02/20, 9:29 pm - +1 (614) 589-7721: So your original comment on splitting up in 5g chunks is correct and I mistook it for a single object size. Sorry.
21/02/20, 9:32 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: no need to sorry buddy...we all are learning...in learning no sorry
21/02/20, 9:38 pm - +91 95150 53146: In AWS did we generate key pair for each server or we use existing key pair for set of servers.  In our private cloud every server has its unique key pair.
21/02/20, 9:43 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: The company info security group would mandate these...generally servers are based on location zones like DMZ zone etc and these group would mandate separate keys for servers for example app, web,db etc
21/02/20, 9:44 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: But no single key for all servers though
21/02/20, 9:48 pm - +91 95150 53146: Thanks Joe
21/02/20, 9:57 pm - +91 99451 41141: Hi Joe, if you are using GUI this happens automatically. If you are uploading programatically you need to call the multi-part upload API that's it. You don't have to do any split
21/02/20, 11:15 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: I am not very pro at development, but shouldn't we go for partitioning mechanic....as we do incase of bigdata....
21/02/20, 11:15 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: mechanics*
21/02/20, 11:17 pm - +1 (510) 646-7148: @6581340874 any recommendation

22/02/39, 7:13 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: The growth of Kubernetes paved path for hundreds of Cloud Native tools.

A prospect spoke about a CNCF tool called Harbor in a meeting today. 

It is an open source container image registry that secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.

Stay tuned to read my next blog about Container Registries. Meanwhile, visit www.goharbor.io to know them if you are interested in Container Registries.
22/02/20, 7:24 am - +91 99451 41141:  awesome. Eagerly looking forward. Also please let us know the differentiator from ECR or any cloud native repos who are also doing RBAC, vulnerability scan etc
22/02/20, 7:24 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I will, Pranesh. I assume ECR means Enterprise Container Registry?

22/02/20, 9:25 pm - +91 99451 41141: Only audio. No screen share
22/02/20, 9:28 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Yes
22/02/20, 9:29 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Yes, only audio

22/02/20, 9:40 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Will MP4 will play this audio file?
22/02/20, 9:45 pm - +65 8372 7592: oops... I missed the interesting session 🤦🏾‍♂ Joe, pls send me the recording
22/02/20, 10:21 pm - +91 81971 70170: This message was deleted
22/02/20, 10:49 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Weekend movies to watch after you listen today's session 
1. 12 Angry Men - be that one character you can find this you tube 
2. In pursue of happiness 
3. Rocket Singh 

As you reflect what Dr. Pradipta shared today you will also find perfect correlation in these movies what he said
22/02/20, 11:01 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Hello can someone assist me in  installing Eclipse on my windows pc
22/02/20, 11:02 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: <Media omitted>
22/02/20, 11:03 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Why u want this IDE?
22/02/20, 11:04 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: To run Selenium with Maven
22/02/20, 11:04 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: I installed JDk already but I'm stuck with Eclipse Ide for java developers
22/02/20, 11:05 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Try installing VSCode
22/02/20, 11:05 pm - +1 (347) 753-7530: I installed Java then eclipse
22/02/20, 11:09 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Letme try this
22/02/20, 11:10 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Yea I did installed Jdk first
22/02/20, 11:10 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Letme me try to change the path first and see
22/02/20, 11:14 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Jude - if u want to practice these tools with the IDE then I would recommend u first u create any linux based VM un your computer and install this IDE inside the VM and the tools
22/02/20, 11:15 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: In majority of the industry in real life folks generally use either linux or unix based environment base OS for these
Windows doesn't go well with all these in my view
22/02/20, 11:16 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Ok in that case I'll use a linux instance
22/02/20, 11:27 pm - +1 (714) 757-8051: What is certifacation path to get AZ400?
22/02/20, 11:27 pm - +91 78993 38220: Does anybody knows React JS?
22/02/20, 11:28 pm - +91 78993 38220: I started learning from google tutorials and my managers asked to learn on this thoroughly..
23/02/20, 6:40 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Before u start learning reactjs I would reccomend u to start with javascript then learn reqctjs as a framework 
Today in the web world we have so many framework like angular js, react js,  vue.js 
Ask your manager why they want u to learn this framework if you are already into devops job
23/02/20, 6:49 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: did u read Lawrence's post on how to be a devops engineer and attend Rajnikant session on DevOps? If not then I would recommend you to read Lawrence post
23/02/20, 6:49 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 
23/02/20, 6:49 am - +1 (714) 757-8051: Sure.I’ll do
23/02/20, 6:49 am - +1 (240) 374-3644: Very nice post
23/02/20, 6:56 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Thanks, Brice.

23/02/20, 10:22 am - +1 (714) 757-8051: If possible , could you cover Microservice with Docker as well?
23/02/20, 10:23 am - +1 (510) 646-7148: Create a hello world spring boot service ,dockerize it and add it into the kubernetes cluster
Can we do it
23/02/20, 10:25 am - +91 99451 41141: I am not expert on Microservices, if someone can chip on that would be great
23/02/20, 10:26 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I'm talking to @919986472547 on that...we will have intro sessions on microservices soon
23/02/20, 10:27 am - +91 99451 41141: Kubernetes is next phase . I am still learning. I can do Amazon ECS for now
23/02/20, 10:27 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Haha...good..good...
23/02/20, 10:31 am - +1 (510) 646-7148: Sure Pranesh should be fine 
23/02/20, 11:06 am - +91 99451 41141: I need a partner for this demo. Do we have anyone in the group working on Amazon ECS today?
23/02/20, 11:09 am - +91 98104 56274: working on AKS though
23/02/20, 11:09 am - +91 98104 56274: Azure Kuber
23/02/20, 11:10 am - +91 98104 56274: plz lemme know if i can be of any assitance

23/02/20, 11:11 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I can do Docker, if  (Pranesh) and everyone is OK with it. 

1. Explain Virtual Machines
2. Containers
3. Install Docker CE
4. Build a Container from Dockerfile
5. Pull, Push and show other few commands
6. Container Registry
7. Podman, Buildah, Skopeo overview

I'm not a hands on guy like many here and will try to hard to cover. No familiarity with Amazon ECS.
23/02/20, 11:12 am - +91 99451 41141: Excellent Lawrence, you can show us the docker part. I can show ECS, Fargate. Atul can help AKS
23/02/20, 11:12 am - +91 98104 56274: good...prnesh can setup  kubernetes cluster with 2 nodes and then we can deploy docker on worker nodes and points 4-7
23/02/20, 11:13 am - +91 98104 56274: either ways EKS Or AKS are same
23/02/20, 11:13 am - +91 98104 56274: we can add some more to point 4-7
23/02/20, 11:13 am - +91 98104 56274: probably deploying entire code via terraform..have not done it but can seach and share somethin
23/02/20, 11:17 am - +91 99451 41141: Atul please show on AKS so we can cover both AWS and Azure
23/02/20, 11:21 am - +1 (714) 757-8051: Joe see if we can plan in evening?We have our Amar, Akbar  and Anthony jodi ready, this is to be going very interesting session
23/02/20, 11:26 am - +91 98104 56274: Next weekend ...not today...I and pranesh will draft aplan and send
23/02/20, 11:26 am - +91 98104 56274: Accordingly will setup the stuff prior to session
23/02/20, 11:27 am - +1 (714) 757-8051: 
23/02/20, 11:33 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: @919945141141 @919810456274 and @13609904470 
If you 3 can discuss internally and come up with a plan starting from VM then all the way via docker and AWS and Azure related services to containers that will be great
Define a problem statement and walk us through how these will help to resolve that problem by adapting to container based services 
We can book mar 14 and mar 15  weekends,  Mar 21 and Mar 22 weekends and Mar 29 and Mar 30 weekends 
Every session 2 to 3 hours and I think 18 hours overall to get trained on these 
@919986472547 - if can join these guys that will be great 

I will setup the sessions from that weekend onwards
23/02/20, 11:35 am - +91 98104 56274: Sure joe....we 3 will connect and share
23/02/20, 11:44 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: /* Define a problem statement and walk us through how these will help to resolve that problem by adapting to container based services */ 
23/02/20, 11:46 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: @6581340874 Please put 1 hour for me on March 15th (Singapore time) for my Container presentation and demo. Though I will cover Docker, try to focus more on vendor agnostic container and implementation.
23/02/20, 11:46 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Actually 1:30 hours.
23/02/20, 11:50 am - +91 99451 41141: E-commerce website needs to handle spiky traffic. It has many components like search product catalogue, recommendations on what to buy, integration with payment gateway systems etc. These are managed by different teams each having their own database. Seperate dev teams, programming languages and release cycle. So thinking of using microservices and containers
23/02/20, 12:08 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Use case 2: I had reviewed T-Mobile DR plan last year. Before adopting Containers, the DR migration took 8 hours for them. Containers brought down this time to 2 hours. Use case 3: I'm evaluating dockerized magento install for a financial client. Currently it takes 6 hours for them to configure a magento VM. We brought down this to 30 minutes by using Docker.
23/02/20, 12:49 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Perfect! We will start with use case 2 since that is common across all industries and relevant
23/02/20, 12:49 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Then we will discuss use case 1
23/02/20, 1:12 pm - +1 (347) 753-7530: Aws vs azure services. This doc would help identify and distinguish with each other. It includes DevOps and Internet monitoring. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/aws-professional/services
23/02/20, 1:16 pm - +1 (347) 753-7530: Oops sorry typo instead of internet monitoring it is application monitoring
23/02/20, 1:31 pm - +91 91824 13490: Thank you very much Pranesh, thank you very much Joe....my bad I couldn't able to join this time😟and the outstanding session...my kind request to you Joe, please share the recording here, so that I can make myself complete with IAM topic of Pranesh's sessions
Thanks in advance
23/02/20, 1:32 pm - +91 91824 13490: and missed the*
23/02/20, 1:47 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 😀😀😀 - U missed this! and unfortunately today's session I also forgot to record 
23/02/20, 1:49 pm - +1 (469) 506-2050: Thats sad to hear
23/02/20, 1:49 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Next time motivation to join such sessions is like this(for folks who are unable to join) - Imagine you are going for a nice holiday but your flight is at very odd hours from your respective country and you don't want to miss the holiday! all sort of motivations will keep you up to join our babies future session! 😀
23/02/20, 1:55 pm - +91 91824 13490: OMG...😟😳😳... please just say you are kidding

23/02/20, 2:36 pm - +91 99451 41141: Also on your question about sending ADFS auth traffic on private network.
We can either have Amazon Directory Services AD connector or Managed AD in your VPC. Make VPN or direct connect and send traffic over this
23/02/20, 2:37 pm - +91 91824 13490: Okay..sure...

23/02/20, 6:42 pm - +65 9851 1007: Done - subscribed
23/02/20, 6:48 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: <Media omitted>
23/02/20, 6:49 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I'm excited and going to be anxious from tomorrow to complete this task - Babies 
23/02/20, 6:49 pm - +91 92915 00789: Hi.. Joe can both work or prepare on python
23/02/20, 7:35 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 😂
23/02/20, 7:35 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 🏽
23/02/20, 7:58 pm - +1 (614) 589-7721: Joe et al , I suggest creating  AWS and Azure accounts for this learning and split the costs amongst us. If you already have such arrangement in place, that's great and let me know the details.
23/02/20, 8:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Yes, that's the plan once we will start building few projects end to end using devops ci/cd pipeline with these cloud platforms
23/02/20, 8:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Sometime from may onwards we will start working on these projects
23/02/20, 8:25 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 
23/02/20, 8:26 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: If all of u can come up with some projects that would be great...projects which we can develop and explain to interviewers during the interview process and we will do something different to get into devops and cloud jobs from July onwards
23/02/20, 8:27 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: The idea is basically to highlight these projects and provide references during the interview process
23/02/20, 8:27 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: This will work wonders
23/02/20, 8:27 pm - +91 98800 09665: Good insights Joe
23/02/20, 8:28 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Today when u go to Amazon or Google or Goldman Sach or Morgan Stanley they all know during our day job on our role we don't get such opportunities
23/02/20, 8:29 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: However in our resume if we highlight we have pet projects with the team they take that something unique and real and we demonstrate how we have developed the required skills to acquire this
23/02/20, 8:29 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: This is inline with what Dr. Pradipta said yesterday
23/02/20, 8:32 pm - +65 9068 4521: Not necessarily. In many banks they are already implementing or implemented devops. I would suggest find an opportunity in your workplace to do it. Few days back I asked about Jenkins and I think Lawrence sent the details. Two guys in my team have already started working on this on top of their daily job. So this is possible.
23/02/20, 8:34 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: A DevOps Engineer must be a performer in the interview. Just like how dancers, actors and singers perform in front of audience and get applause. 

Most of the time, I see great talent in the interviews but they have hard time to be a performer. They don't take us through the screen play of their DevOps experience.
23/02/20, 8:42 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies added +91 98997 87323
23/02/20, 8:39 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Could you explain more on the performance part or screenplay?
23/02/20, 8:45 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: imagine you are in a elevator and the CTO happen to be in the same elevator...it's you and him/her only...you got roughly 2 minutes to introduce to this CTO...how would you introduce yourself to this CTO that after he will remember and definitely make a reference in the next 1 month....let's start!
23/02/20, 8:46 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 
23/02/20, 8:47 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Of course Dinesh.
23/02/20, 8:50 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I came into the industry during late 90's and the technology had maximum 2 or 3 components into it. For example, most of my Oracle interviews had questions related to SQL and PL/SQL. That's it. The complexity was to remember them and practice. There was no google. Due to the smaller layers of technology, the questions were always on Q&A type. 'What is the difference between stored procedure and function?'. 'What is trigger?" 'Tell me an example for a nested SQL query'. We also had paper based tests to prove our knowledge.

Gone are those days, at least in Americas.

DevOps is a pipeline and integrated. For example, look at his diagram.
23/02/20, 8:50 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: <Media omitted>
23/02/20, 8:54 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I created this diagram for a customer presentation. A typical Java application development needs maximum 4 entities even today. 1. Desktop 2. IDE 3. Application Server and 4. Database. 

In DevOps, the code comes through many layers (I setup a Pipeline for a retail client with 21 layers) before it reaches Production. In interviews, a DevOps engineer should demonstrate the above with passion and how it worked for them. 

We also interview DevOps engineer for siloed work. Just to build application, or write automation code. We don't expect screen play from them however it is a rare case scenario. In contrast to Java application development, the layers of application development and build at DevOps should be explained by the candidate better. Act the act.
23/02/20, 8:54 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Hope I answered your question.
23/02/20, 8:57 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Got it Lawrence thanks for the explanation.
23/02/20, 8:57 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Now what are the basic layers of the application development/build is the
23/02/20, 8:57 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Question
23/02/20, 8:58 pm - +65 8381 5514: App/web(gui)/db (3 tier) - very basic layers
23/02/20, 8:59 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: No problem. Visualize the above pipeline is divided among two Clouds, On-Premise, AD connectivity, Mainframe call and backend Big data. It is way more complex. However the right amount of home work and interpersonal skills will get someone understand the complex problems.
23/02/20, 8:59 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: you mean, DevOps?
23/02/20, 8:59 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I will add one more that is communication layer
23/02/20, 9:01 pm - +91 95828 94296: Presentation , business,dataaccess
23/02/20, 9:02 pm - +91 95828 94296: Dl can then be divided in sub layers

23/02/20, 9:03 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: The ceo or too management guy might not understand all DevOps layers
23/02/20, 9:04 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: May be I am not sure
23/02/20, 9:04 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: The CEO won't interview someone for DevOps role in fortune companies. 
23/02/20, 9:05 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Yes but just as a reference if we have to talk about in 2 mins to a management guy what do we say
23/02/20, 9:05 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Which layers do we talk about
23/02/20, 9:05 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Let me tell you the scenario.
23/02/20, 9:07 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: No layers and no tech stuff....he/she looking for revenue generated ideas
23/02/20, 9:08 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 15 years back, I was sitting in a bank with financial executives, IT and engineers. A top finance executive asked a question 'What is J2EE?'. One of our guy replied 'J2EE is a framework that enable you to build systems with JDBC connection pools, Java messaging, email connectivity, session management and one can build packages with .war, ear formats'. The financial executive fainted on the spot. Now tell me Dinesh. What would be an appropriate answer to his question? I answered and he still talks about it in many places. Even in one of his TED show, he mentioned my name.
23/02/20, 9:09 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: If you answer this, then I give you 30 seconds pitch for DevOps to any C executive.
23/02/20, 9:10 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: OR someone can answer this question 'What is J2EE?'. Imagine I'm that Financial executive who is an end user for a computer.
23/02/20, 9:13 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Is it an faster way to put your business applications in the market and integrate with other products
23/02/20, 9:13 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: I am just guessing
23/02/20, 9:13 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: J2EE?
23/02/20, 9:13 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Lol just kidding I am not a developer and don’t know anything about j2ee
23/02/20, 9:14 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: But sure it sounds very interesting
23/02/20, 9:14 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: No problem. This was my answer to that Financial Executive 'J2EE is a programming language from Sun Microsystems'. That's all he wanted to know.
23/02/20, 9:15 pm - +91 95150 53146: Kernel of java application server
23/02/20, 9:15 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: He will faint again with the word 'Kernel'.
23/02/20, 9:15 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 
23/02/20, 9:15 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Lol
23/02/20, 9:15 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: So Dinesh!
23/02/20, 9:16 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Got it Lawrence
23/02/20, 9:17 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: This is my elevator speech to any C about DevOps 'DevOps is an IT culture that enable Development and Infrastructure (Ops) teams to work together to build a software defined infrastructure and business applications to speed to market. It has set of tools to provide automation capabilities'.
23/02/20, 9:19 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: From this I understand that we have to simple and concise with our explanation on what we do
23/02/20, 9:19 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: @16462494127 If you still want to fine tune, you can make me an intro to that C executive. We go together as a team to educate him and I will also give a pitch to him about our product. you will get stock options if the deal goes through.
23/02/20, 9:21 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: I was just taking a thought from Joe’s idea so was giving it as an example. If I come across any such executive I will remember this Lawrence and let you know
23/02/20, 9:21 pm - +1 (646) 249-4127: Thanks for the explanation 
23/02/20, 9:21 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Thank you 
23/02/20, 9:22 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: It is always good to explain technology without its terms. They understand. Believe me, I used to write proposal with procurement, licensing, vendor management people today. They always write 'Dockers'.

Thanks Lawrence!!
23/02/20, 9:25 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Any time, Prabhuraj. In 20's and even 30's, a person has an urge to prove what s/he knows and nothing wrong in it. Once we reach certain age and maturity, we somehow stop proving ourselves. But ended up helping others. I'm 63 years old. you can see the difference.

24/02/20, 9:23 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: @6581340874 Infrastructure Evaluation for Container Service
1. Define guiding principles for Containers.

GP1: What container software is required? (Currently it is Docker however it is good to evaluate others too to look fair).
GP2: How do you want to build them? Using Jenkins? or building it on the host itself for POC?
GP3: Do you need an Orchestration platform such as Kubernetes to for evaluation? OR running at the host itself?

If no Kubernetes, then you have to implement other essential NFR's on your own. Meaning, whatever Kubernetes does to the containers should be provisioned manually.

If yes Kubernetes, the dynamics will change. A new learning and evaluation curve.

2. Identification of all source code of SECORE
It is internal to your team. If the all source code exists at SVN then moving to GIT requires some amount of source code management re-engineering work.

3. Write source code in Java to convert COBOL programs

Why Java? As you know, Java is not a very suitable language to implement Micorservices based architecture due to its JRE dependency, slow start, heap memory issues and non elasticity.

Are they open to use Python? It will enable you to break the program in smaller pieces.

4. Deploy Java Code into the Container

It needs an application server. What application server will you use? Containerizing Oracle JDK will raise unique license requirements from Oracle (IMO, a client needs Oracle approval to put the Oracle JDK into the Container). Are you open to use OpenJDK? Support model?

You have to build a playbook with all essential and possible factors before think of converting the COBOL program. Once you define the foundation for Containers, then you should be fine. I'm here to help in anyway I could.
24/02/20, 9:29 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Many thanks Lawrence! 
24/02/20, 9:29 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 
24/02/20, 9:34 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: This gave me a good start...I've a meeting with my friend from infra side today afternoon on this on some of your GP points 
Point 3 - mainly skillset perspective otherwise my boss gave me decision to whatever the language I can choose..I can certainly reevaluate this...these guiding principles gave me a good start...I just came out from my one o one 
He asked me to add few more 
Framework 
Resource 
Expected functionality 

And these resounded me with our yesterday discussion threads with one of your point 'make it always simple' 
24/02/20, 9:50 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Any python based good frameworks that I can start evaluating for this POC for my project?
24/02/20, 9:54 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Flask has more support in the community. For choosing Python Framework, you have to evaluate them too Joe.

24/02/20, 3:33 pm - +91 80561 63055: Installation on Macbook might be difficult. If it's a powerful config, you can try using KVM and run two virtual machines and try installing. 

If you just want to get a hang of deploying applications or kubectl commands, you can try minikube. It runs a single node kubernetes cluster on your localhost

A better way of representing the RACI. Its called a swimlane because in swimming, each one is swimming in his own lane without over lap/conflict etc

24/02/20, 11:22 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: happy watching/listening to this 1 hour documentary video...half way through you will definitely fall asleep  - It's amazing when I was listening to my own voice and how many times I was repeating 'basically', 'one of the thing' etc... time for me to pull the old book from my home library  'The Art of Public Speaking by Dale Carnegie'
24/02/20, 11:24 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Superb. I use 'and' 'yang' often. Time to cut the usage.
24/02/20, 11:29 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Thank you all the 20 guys and gals for your time and  giving me an opportunity to share what I learned...in today's digital world audiences who have taken time to attend the sessions are the customers 
24/02/20, 11:36 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I forgot one thing during the session on the assignment 
Don't look for answers in Google or stackoverflow but try to complete on your own 
You will get frustrated initially but   writing code no gain if there is no pain
24/02/20, 11:37 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Thanks alot Joe fr the recording watching now at work on my phone
24/02/20, 11:46 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Adding one of my other mentor Abhi who has kindly gave me go ahead to be part of this group going forward

25/02/20, 2:29 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Can u elaborate this in detail as what you are looking for from terraform with Azure cloud? 
Are you looking for code samples or trying to understand how this work?
25/02/20, 2:31 pm - +91 98863 34280: I creating infrastructure using Azure terraform script n executed successfully....but i have an issue connecting to Rdp into the new vm ...
25/02/20, 2:31 pm - +91 98863 34280: Nsg rule is configured

25/02/20, 5:21 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: During the coming weekend anyone keen to take session on GITHUB and how this is actually setup in enterprise ?
25/02/20, 5:22 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Let me know and I will setup the session based on your availability
25/02/20, 5:23 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Otherwise I will call out the name and you have to do 😀
25/02/20, 5:44 pm - +91 98863 34280: Can Any body help on the terraform pls
25/02/20, 5:44 pm - +91 80561 63055: Try a telnet to that server against that port number
25/02/20, 5:45 pm - +91 80561 63055: If that works, no problems with firewall or security groups
25/02/20, 5:45 pm - +91 80561 63055: If not , you need to check the firewall and security groups.
25/02/20, 5:45 pm - +91 80561 63055: If that works, problem most likely lies in your RDP session - check your mstsc settings
25/02/20, 5:57 pm - +91 95380 02859: Check the remote settings under control panel remote settings
25/02/20, 5:58 pm - +91 95380 02859: It should be Allow remote connections to this computer
25/02/20, 5:58 pm - +91 99451 41141: Not a Azure guy, but curious what is the IP address of the machine?
25/02/20, 5:59 pm - +91 99451 41141: I want to rule out connecting via private IP
25/02/20, 6:16 pm - +91 98863 34280: 2 Vms are deployed under load balancer...both Vms are having Load balancer public IP
25/02/20, 6:17 pm - +91 99451 41141: Are you trying to RDP to Load balancer IP 😳
25/02/20, 6:20 pm - +91 98863 34280: Yes...I tried connecting with LB ip....also with DNS ...but still no luck...
25/02/20, 6:21 pm - +91 98863 34280: Ideally each Vm will have public ip and private ip...we do RDP into it using its public ip
25/02/20, 6:21 pm - +91 99451 41141: Load balancer is usually for routing http/https traffic across   webserver, it won't work for RDP.
25/02/20, 6:21 pm - +91 99451 41141: You need a connection manager for that
25/02/20, 6:23 pm - +91 99451 41141: Or a bastion host/ jump server
25/02/20, 6:23 pm - +91 98863 34280: This is internal load balancer not internet load balancer
25/02/20, 6:24 pm - +91 98863 34280: If it is public LB...we need to do with port 80 n 443
25/02/20, 6:25 pm - +91 98863 34280: It is internal LB within a Vnet
25/02/20, 6:26 pm - +91 99451 41141: Buddy load balancer is not meant to redirect RDP connections.
25/02/20, 6:28 pm - +91 98863 34280: I know we use it for managing the traffic...
25/02/20, 6:28 pm - +91 99451 41141: Tell me your use case here or call me, we can discuss
25/02/20, 6:29 pm - +91 98863 34280: Can someone help me with what is the issue with my code...
25/02/20, 6:29 pm - +91 98863 34280: Sure
25/02/20, 6:38 pm - +91 99451 41141: To summarise you would like to enable public IP for a VM from Terraform script. I will try to check. Request other Azure and Terraform guys to pitch in too. Seems urgent requirement
25/02/20, 6:46 pm - +91 98863 34280: Thanks Pranesh for quick response...🏻
25/02/20, 7:04 pm - +91 98863 34280: I generated 2 public ips using terraform script but unable to assign this Ips to a VM using Terraform...
25/02/20, 7:05 pm - +91 81971 70170: Send the instance and IP screen shot
25/02/20, 7:43 pm - +91 91824 13490: resource "aws_eip_association" "ip-associate" {

}
25/02/20, 7:44 pm - +91 91824 13490: Hope you have used the above set of resource block to assign the IP to the required instance..

25/02/20, 7:49 pm - +91 98863 34280: TCP
25/02/20, 7:52 pm - +91 81971 70170: Rdp is working

25/02/20, 7:53 pm - +91 81971 70170: Have you tried this
25/02/20, 7:54 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: can u check if can add the above code to your VM section to associate the public ip addresses
25/02/20, 7:54 pm - +91 91824 13490: Oh sorry friend, I considered you are working for AWS..
25/02/20, 7:55 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 
25/02/20, 7:56 pm - +91 98863 34280: RDP is not working....I need to login...for testing...
25/02/20, 7:56 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: also change the variable names to something meaningful for all the resources in your code you have used "test" almost everywhere....
25/02/20, 7:56 pm - +91 81971 70170: Have you bypass the proxy gateway
25/02/20, 7:57 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: for this associate_public_ip_address =  your ip address
  associate_public_ip_address = true
25/02/20, 7:58 pm - +91 98863 34280: i am baby on Terraform script....so go with the name test...will use proper naming convention during project implementation.thanks for suggestion
25/02/20, 8:10 pm - +91 91824 13490: 😛
25/02/20, 10:22 pm - +91 98104 56274: Hi pranesh and Lawrence,  below is the high level plan for the demo, please add some more bits to it, probably we can connect separate to finalize


Create a AKS cluster on Azure ( we can either prepare before the session)
On that cluster create 5 services, 5 pods with replica sets. We shall use pod yaml files for app, db and redis. Similarly create service, deployments configuration files for pods and then deploy the environment
explain yaml codes for k8
use native networking for kubernets
access the service and do the testing
25/02/20, 10:22 pm - +91 98104 56274: I have got the yaml with me on my github
25/02/20, 10:32 pm - +91 99451 41141: Nice Atul. I will call and discuss this. Note we will do this earlier.
Lawrence is planning a detailed containers session on March 15
25/02/20, 10:33 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Atul, great content. Please carry on. I will do a Container Session on March 15th.
25/02/20, 10:40 pm - +91 89750 03417: I have been switching from azure to aws so don't remember all by heart but seem you raised only inbound at RDP port and NSG are bidirectional
25/02/20, 10:42 pm - +1 (347) 753-7530: Yes I was also thinking the same but was afraid 😱 to write.
25/02/20, 10:45 pm - +91 98863 34280: Ok you mean to say i need add outbound rule for RDP port ?
25/02/20, 10:56 pm - +91 98104 56274: Sure pranesh
25/02/20, 10:57 pm - +91 98104 56274: Thank you sir...will seek your guidance as well...
25/02/20, 10:57 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Of course, Atul. I can help with your content.
25/02/20, 11:03 pm - +91 89750 03417: Yes plz as data need to travel both way. Further check what are network level nsg then vm or nic..
26/02/20, 8:34 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Hi @13609904470 , @919810456274 , and @919945141141 
Great start...Thanks for taking these future sessions 
We will kick off with Lawrence session to understand docker, k8 and the problem statement, benefits then 
We will dive into Azure and AWS containers services
26/02/20, 8:35 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Lawrence's definition on PODS is wonderful...he published that in LinkedIn...babies group - follow him in LinkedIn

26/02/20, 5:39 pm - +44 7775 027250: I need to extract the last line into a csv.
26/02/20, 5:39 pm - +44 7775 027250: <Media omitted>
26/02/20, 5:40 pm - +44 7775 027250: I have a ansible playbook to run it, can anyone help please?
26/02/20, 6:18 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: what are these values? is the last line value will always be constant? you mean you need to write the 3rd line to a csv file?
26/02/20, 6:19 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: are you using MONGO DB?
26/02/20, 6:19 pm - +44 7775 027250: Yes joe the line beginning 360575 ...

26/02/20, 6:23 pm - +44 7775 027250: Anything will do, I just need the last line output in a csv. I then execute it over all the machines using ansible a collect the csvs
26/02/20, 6:23 pm - +44 7775 027250: And *
26/02/20, 6:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: ok..sounds like you are collecting your database configuration management values and want to store in a file....my interpretation after reading the code
26/02/20, 6:24 pm - +44 7775 027250: Correct
26/02/20, 6:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: ok boss...now one final question
26/02/20, 6:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: you are interested in the line number or values in that line number?
26/02/20, 6:27 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I'm trying to find out which function from your script is generating this output...if you can find out that will be great..we will add the code the ship it over you via Singapore Airlines tonight! 
26/02/20, 6:29 pm - +44 7775 027250: Lol, the  code is written differently. The print(sizes) in side mongo_cmds generate those values
26/02/20, 6:29 pm - +44 7775 027250: No just the values in the last line
26/02/20, 6:30 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: ok sure....will start working on this and you get this tonight singapore time....

26/02/20, 7:36 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Thanks...this code review need single malt whisky  after another reivew I found that it is using nested list
26/02/20, 7:38 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: let me find out how to extract the 3rd line for you ...writing to csv fine code is working....
26/02/20, 7:38 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: now to extract the third line
26/02/20, 7:40 pm - +91 80561 63055: If it's just 3rd line, it's all okay. But if you're looking for repetitive/frequent csv operations, you can consider pandas
26/02/20, 7:53 pm - +44 7775 027250: Yes, only need to capture the values from the 3rd line
26/02/20, 7:54 pm - +44 7775 027250: It's just the 3rd line mate, no operation on the values. I have been trying hard on this. My limited knowledge of python is not enough to get this out
26/02/20, 7:57 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: that's fine...we will get this...just need to trace the third line in the nested list...and we replace that syntax inside the writer.writerow([here])
26/02/20, 7:58 pm - +65 8381 5514: Hi Amit, if just 3rd may be sed is simple on unix

26/02/20, 9:43 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: that I got it...

26/02/20, 9:51 pm - +44 7775 027250: Great, I think the question is how to save the output of a subprocess.call into a csv rather then shell = true where the value is displayed on the shell post execution
26/02/20, 10:08 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: is there anyway you can run in your computer the below javascript in a browser and see the output

26/02/20, 10:10 pm - +91 80561 63055: Put it in a HTML file with the code snippet under <script> and </script> tags. And write your output to console.log
26/02/20, 10:11 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: can u send me the updated script
26/02/20, 10:11 pm - +91 80561 63055: Then when you open the html on a browser, right click and go to inspect mode and in the righ hand side column you can check the console tab

Your home stuff ? 
Browsing, photo copy and share, mobile backup, simple online studying, little MAC OS exploration, Mobile app development, etc
Then go for MAC

Your Work or Upskilling Stuff ?
DevOps, Cloud tools stuff, pet projects, education that involves heavy operations (with high use of memory, CPU) but for a short duration (multiple times of short duration usage), pet projects that needs many web based or online tools
Then go for EC2

28/02/20, 5:29 pm - Usha Devops Babies: AS RECEIVED: The new NCP coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days, how can one know if he/she is infected. By the time they have fever and/or cough and goes to the hospital, the lungs is usually 50 % Fibrosis and it's too late!

Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning:

Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness or tightness etc it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection.

In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air!

SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases.  Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That's very dangerous. 
Pls send and share with family, friends and everyone about this ! Take care everyone n may the world recovers from corona virus soon. May all be well n happy

29/02/20, 1:47 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Here is a quick test - let's see how many of you without distraction have watched this short clip...if you are then say 'yes!'
29/02/20, 1:48 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: <Media omitted>
29/02/20, 1:48 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: In the meantime let me clean the utensils now at home 😀

29/02/20, 3:26 pm - +91 99451 41141: When is next python class.cant wait 😀
29/02/20, 4:31 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Can anyone find out how to simulate more traffic to a website to ensure website becomes slow while loading initial page ? 
And if this is possible are you guys ok we do a mini project using AWS services and learn the load balance , elastic ip , scaling features? 
We may need to share the cost among ourselves I think the overall cost perhaps around USD 300
29/02/20, 4:32 pm - +44 7775 027250: Great idea, I'm in
29/02/20, 4:34 pm - +65 8381 5514: I am in!!
Not really sure how to hit high traffic at a time!!
29/02/20, 4:39 pm - +65 9850 4376: open multiple instances of web page using script 
will that help
29/02/20, 4:45 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Yes we need to simulate the traffic then we can work on this project 
Don't worry about the landing page someone in our group will create a page
29/02/20, 4:45 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Thanks, Suresh...if this works out that will be great
29/02/20, 4:58 pm - +65 8482 8192: deploy a website on ec2 Linux with a public ip and hit in multiple browser tabs or multiple location. you will experience the asg work
29/02/20, 4:59 pm - +91 99451 41141: If you want to trigger autoscaling,  I might be able to find a cpubusy script which will trigger cloudwatch alarm
29/02/20, 4:59 pm - +91 99451 41141: Use t2 micro and be in free tier
29/02/20, 5:00 pm - +91 99451 41141: Give me the $300
29/02/20, 5:00 pm - +91 99451 41141: 😜

29/02/20, 8:59 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: <Media omitted>
29/02/20, 9:00 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: first we want to create the traffic in the 1 webserver for the website then we will practice the remaining concepts
29/02/20, 9:00 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: so far Prabhu, Amit said they will chip in for whatever cost for this learning...anyone else keen to join us?
29/02/20, 9:01 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: we also want to use few elastic ip address, elb, scaling to practically learn all these through this mini assignment
29/02/20, 9:44 pm - +91 99451 41141: Fyi, elastic IP is free when attached to running EC2 instance. It's charged when instance is off. Anyways, what is the use case for elastic IP? NAT Gateway?
29/02/20, 9:50 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: elastic ip atleast 2 we are looking to ensure even after the ec2 reboot happen they retain the same ip...I'm trying to simulate a echannel or ecommerce kind of application for this practice
29/02/20, 9:55 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: In my previous job I was a support manager for a corporate channel application that frequently became slow during specific times of a day and the 4 instances of webservers were down on somedays (not all but 1 or 2) and then during all deployment activities the dev group used to bring down all web,app,db servers for deployment....next day morning I was running incident call which later became a routine (I mean monday morning after deployment going to be few sev1/serv2 incidents, payment cut-off will be missed etc...etc...)...the infra folks said our app hardware combo is outdated...the dev folks said application running on a vendor code base so not predictble and my team and I were listening to business side tantrum...later I went to the business side and the story became the customers we were transacting with the bank started scolding me because of this bank app so lousy...my boss(business side) told me that our job is to listen those scolding!
29/02/20, 9:56 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I'm trying to recreate this scenario and instead of me spending around USD 300😀😀😀 looking more people to contribute 😀😀😀
29/02/20, 9:57 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: the bank gave the name to the website as GEB 'Global Electronic Banking' we renamed that as 'Garbage Electronic Burden' like what people gave name to IBM as 'International Black Market'
29/02/20, 10:04 pm - +91 99451 41141: When traffic comes via load balancer why elastic IP for EC2?
29/02/20, 10:08 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: first we create problem then we explore various ways to solve the problem
29/02/20, 10:09 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: in the production support area, we are notorious for that even if we know in advance the best solution 😀😀 there is a phase called problem managment....we go to that problem management meeting and talk all options and the dev folks go back and work with all possible options
29/02/20, 10:09 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: load balancer is the next step....
29/02/20, 10:10 pm - +91 99451 41141: 
29/02/20, 10:11 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: if I get a job a implementation manager either with aws or google I can bring more money to the company if the client is all asia regional banks 😀😀😀
29/02/20, 10:11 pm - +65 8381 5514: When i was doing channels (ebanking/mobile banking) - we used to deploy on 2 servers (4servers cluster) after pulling out from web pool. Test it with direct url on changes done.
Reapeat it another set
29/02/20, 10:11 pm - +65 8381 5514: Luckly i never faced problem..
29/02/20, 10:12 pm - +65 8381 5514: But it always challenging in channels /trade appa
29/02/20, 10:12 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: app logic was in-built and inhouse developer or a vendor product?
29/02/20, 10:12 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: *developed
29/02/20, 10:13 pm - +65 8381 5514: In house - it was on linux/java platform
29/02/20, 10:13 pm - +65 8381 5514: Oracle
29/02/20, 10:14 pm - +65 8381 5514: 99.7 sla availabilty ... so no risk taking. 
Used to be like a war like preparations for release
29/02/20, 10:16 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: in my case the big boss used to ask (in whatsapp group) how was the release on monday morning...sometime we say 'Very Good, Operation is Successful (means deployment was successful) but the Patient Died (means production failed)!
29/02/20, 10:17 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 😂
29/02/20, 10:17 pm - +65 8381 5514: 😀😀

29/02/20, 10:19 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Swamigal: Sorry Doug, I executed the QA change ticket at Production by mistake. It brought down few traffic lights at Casa Blanca.
Doug Algire: It's OK. What drink you like?
Year 2005, IBM Global Services, Casa Blanca, Morocco
29/02/20, 10:21 pm - +1 (714) 408-6025: This isn’t big.  Recently One of dba accidentally brought down prod dB. Because there was one character difference (name) in prod to stage.
29/02/20, 10:21 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 😂
29/02/20, 10:24 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Lawrence (at 10 PM): Chang, I made a mistake. When removed Veritas at production, I used $rm -rf . /. . It removed our yesterday's peoplesoft work. All gone :(

Chang: It's OK. I'm free tonight. Let's rebuild.

Chang is a PeopleSoft engineer and stayed with me until 5 AM to reinstall and configure.

Next day morning

Lawrence: Alan (the boss), I made a mistake yesterday that corrupted the system. We fixed it.

Alan: Good, there is no need to tell me that. It happens. Let's go for a coffee.

29/02/20, 10:26 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: -- Many big people (Parents, teachers, Bosses, Ex girl friends) forgive my mistakes.. That's why I'm still roaming.
29/02/20, 10:28 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 2009 : Taiwan country data center to run local.applications the fax receiving server was there while the computer was connected to the power cable

The office cleaning lady had access to the data center to clean the floors...she saw the computer running but no one is using so she switched off and unplugged the cable 

Singapore was crazy because clients were unable to send trade instructions via fax 

Incident managers, app managers, managers manager in two countries scratching their head and countless discussion until someone being asked to go and check the server 
He went and found the server is switched off 
Lady proudly said she felt wastage of electricity so she pulled out the plug

29/02/20, 11:39 pm - +44 7775 027250: Unfortunately,  I'm in support(on call) from 6 am till 6pm. I will check, if there is someone from India who can hold the fort while I join the call.
29/02/20, 11:41 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I thought you are somehow not feeling ok because you had a Mexican burrito in Belfast and you are feeling now you want to take some rest 😀 you get the idea😀
29/02/20, 11:43 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: but out of curiosity why you are on call support on Sunday unless there is a scheduled maintenance or deployment or unless you are part of a 24/7/365 client facing application or are you part of infra support covering various environments?
29/02/20, 11:47 pm - +44 7775 027250: Schools are off now and that's why I'm working with half of the team. I'm monitoring opsgeni covering 6DC mate.

If the first number 3 then it is Amex, 4 for Visa and 5 for master card
01/03/20, 12:27 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I didn't know this algorithm so far but generally the card number 16 digit validations have different rule
01/03/20, 12:28 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: This algorithm looks something different to me ...we can write the python program but the code won't be solving a valid use case
01/03/20, 12:29 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: What u do in Zimbabwe? I mean what's ur day job?

01/03/20, 8:00 am - +91 99451 41141: Joe for ypur AWS project please consider using spot instances to reduce your bill and N.Virginia region too

01/03/20, 11:43 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Ok thanks Joe
01/03/20, 11:48 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: * So I created a jenkins master-slave architecture using ubuntu free tier ec2 instances
* I was able to connect to jenkins dashboard using the public ip of the master and also create a slave-node using the slave ec2 instance w the help of filezilla and also integrate a git repo from my github account 
* When I sign out of my jenkins master - slave instances, the next time I get in I'm able to get into the jenkins dashboard but my slave node won't connect
01/03/20, 11:50 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: * Since launching the instance always gives a new public ip fr the master and slave I followed same steps I took to connect the slave-node through downloading the java.jar and master-slave.jnlp files from jenkins dashboard 
*Transferring the files to my Jenkins-slave ubuntu instance using filezilla 
*Running the code on the slave to connect the node to the master doesn't work
01/03/20, 11:58 pm - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: I am also very new to jenkins.. but just give one try...

Go to manage jenkins-Configure system..there jenkins location...change it to new ip
01/03/20, 11:59 pm - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: I mean in jenkins url change old ip with new ip of master ec2
01/03/20, 11:59 pm - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: Now try ur command on slave...in command alos we have one ip ..that ip should be of new master..
02/03/20, 12:01 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: New ip of master or slave?
02/03/20, 12:02 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: Master..
02/03/20, 12:03 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: Ok letme test and see
02/03/20, 12:08 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: So what about the java.jar and master-slave.jnlp files ?
02/03/20, 12:08 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: do I need a new one each time the ip of the slave changes ?
02/03/20, 12:12 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: No...try with old one
02/03/20, 12:13 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: Perfect it worked
02/03/20, 12:13 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: 
02/03/20, 12:15 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: So basically I'm supposed to make sure the ip url is changed to the new ip of the master and simply copy the jar and jnlp code of the slave and run it on the new slave
02/03/20, 12:16 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: Change jenkins url and then run command on slave..
02/03/20, 12:17 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: In command also we have ip.. right.? Did u changed that?
02/03/20, 12:17 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: Yeah the same ip of the new master
02/03/20, 12:18 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: So I couldn't connect befr bc the ip on the code was the old ip of the master rather than the new one
02/03/20, 12:18 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: Yes..
02/03/20, 12:18 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: No it's the same one I used for the url ip
02/03/20, 12:19 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: Ok...
02/03/20, 12:20 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: Thanks alot Sarika u nailed it and from this I understand better the architecture
02/03/20, 12:22 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: No problem...I also faced same problem before 2 weeks...somehow I could fix it...
02/03/20, 12:22 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: We can only learn better when we make mistakes or run into errors getting them fixed gives us a better understanding
02/03/20, 12:23 am - Sarika Sadashiv Pawar: Right..
02/03/20, 12:23 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Thank you, Pranesh. 
02/03/20, 12:24 am - +91 79790 82525: @6583727592 This is all about default prediction of companies (listed or not). We have built an neural network model for this. SBI observed our prediction on test data for next six month after our submission. Our model predicted that 8 companies would default in medium term and 6 of them actually defaulted and went for insolvency.
02/03/20, 12:29 am - +91 79790 82525: so now we want to scale this and build a complete platform where a bank will give the company name and it will display cards (information cards) related to its probability of default and the 360-degree information about the company like the reasons behind this score. and then we can build multiple use cases around it.
02/03/20, 12:30 am - +91 79790 82525: @6581340874 would you like to be our independent advisor? Your presence and suggestion will give significant boost to our morality
02/03/20, 12:30 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I took 2 Quil tablets.. It made me a bacon until 10 AM PST. 😂
02/03/20, 12:36 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies:  it's an honour and thank you for considering me and giving me an opportunity. You guys will rock in the India Market and I can see soon a young hedge fund is getting its shape. 
I never thought in my imagination that  one day I will get such kind of opportunity, once again thank you for this. I'm truly previlidged
02/03/20, 2:53 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: <Media omitted>
02/03/20, 2:55 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Ha ha ha😂
02/03/20, 3:49 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Gals and Guys - anyone got some hands-on experience as how whitelisting of IP works in a cloud environment ? In an on-premise enviornment (applicable to banking) it is a very lengthy process (roughly two weeks)...first the compliance has to give go-ahead from bank side provided client's team accepted the T&C of the bank then IT team raise change requests for firewall opening which goes through a series of paperwork process and finally when everyone approve the change in one of the weekend the IP's are whitelisted
02/03/20, 3:51 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: from a client perspective allowing the client's IP opened up with the bank for the connectivity is anywhere two to four weeks on best case basis and this is subject to all in place if there is any query from anyone from the any of the team then that goes on and on

02/03/20, 10:01 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: pranesh - why some people certification who appeared before 2017 never expiry or before that AWS didn't had the 2 year or 3 year rule?
02/03/20, 10:04 am - +1 (732) 666-7345: Joe . I don’t think so. I had certification in 2016 which got expired in 2019.

02/03/20, 11:53 am - +65 8482 8192: lol no. but this more worthy than USD 80 😀🥃
02/03/20, 11:53 am - +65 8372 7592: I doubt if you can do it with regular WhatsApp account... You may need a WhatsApp business account I guess

02/03/20, 1:02 pm - +91 99451 41141: Thanks for this, I finally cracked it after hours of struggling.
I almost thought python was cheating me as the code was right according to my logic.
But finally I made it somehow.

Quick question, how to do quick testing instead of typing 16 digit everytime and breaking the keys
02/03/20, 1:09 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: search credit card dataset in internet you will get the input data
02/03/20, 1:34 pm - +91 99451 41141: Yes, but how to automate testing with many values? 
Unit testing. If possible cover someday
02/03/20, 1:55 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Automated testing I don't know much but during our CI/CD pipeline let's see if someone can cover these
02/03/20, 3:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: FYI - Just got go ahead from a Recruitment Leader who has 20 years of experience in diverse industry covering asia countries...I will be setting up this talk sometime in March 3rd week..it is going to be a Q&A session...If you folks are interested to know how recruitment works, how company ATS portal works and how the inudstry works...

02/03/20, 6:07 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Automatic Tracking System
02/03/20, 6:07 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: all companiees job website portal is actually ATS enabled
02/03/20, 6:09 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: did u notice some companiees send an automated email the moment you apply job in their website saying 'thank you bla...bla...if we find your resume suitable then a member of our recuritment team will contact you....' and after 15 days or 30 days you get an email 'Thank you for your time and applying for a job...we regret to inform you that bla...bla...
02/03/20, 6:09 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: when you apply for a job in the website don't think that a recruiter is actually reading your email and reading your resume etc...
02/03/20, 6:10 pm - +91 76800 89473: Lol..true
02/03/20, 6:10 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: more when the Leader will speak 😀
02/03/20, 6:10 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: otherwise I will end up being T shaped professional 
02/03/20, 6:10 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: The trick is you should write your resume in such a way that it will pass the ATS system

03/03/20, 1:05 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Mobility, Career, More Money Tips (was browsing some of my post in LinkedIn) 
----------------------------------
Rule No. 1 - Make sure how many 1 and 2 level above your boss across the organization know you due to whatever reason but ensure it has to be for the right idea! Don't flatter and come across as a smart asshole! Leaders are brilliant than you and by the way and they have reached there after experiencing everything.

Rule No. 2 - You have to be a salesperson! Once you thoroughly understand the 3 aspects of your job (operational, functional, political), then you need to find out who can take you on their team?

Rule No. 3 - There are 2 types of skills. A. Transferable skills (you can learn these in your job) b. building own skills (you need to invest your own money outside of your company to acquire this. Once you have a strong foundation of these skills, then you need to follow rule no. 2.

Rule No. 4 - Build a robust LinkedIn Profile with their premium services. Get some recommendations for your profile, but the recommendations need to be very genuine and real and need to have the actual feedback. No sugar coating words!
03/03/20, 1:11 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Rahul and Amit joined a wholesale company together just after graduation, both worked very hard.

After several years, the boss promoted Amit to sales executive but Rahul remained a sales representative. One day Rahul could not take it anymore, tender resignation to the boss and complained the boss did not value hard working staff, but only promoted those who flattered him.

The boss knew that Rahul worked very hard for the years, but in order to help him realize the difference between him and Amit, the boss asked Rahul, “Go and find out anyone selling water melon in the market?? Rahul returned and said, “Yes”. The boss asked,” how much per kg?” Rahul went back to the market to ask and returned to inform boss the 20 Rupees per kg.

Then Boss told Rahul, let me ask Amit the same question.

Amit went, returned and said,” Boss, only one person is selling melons.  20 Rupees per kg, 150 Rupees per 10Kg. He has around 300 melons. On the table around 35 melons, weight about 3kg each. He bought from so and so area before 2 days, all are fresh and red, good quality. He is also willing to give 10% discount if we are going to purchase bulk melons(~20). 

Rahul was very impressed and realized the difference between him and Amit. He decides not to resign but to learn from Amit.

05/03/20, 8:03 am - +1 (714) 757-8051: I started Azure DevOps but in my accounts GCP is coming in next 6 months so our managers and client ask us to focus on GCP

05/03/20, 8:20 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Find out what problem your client is trying to resolve after they migrate to GCP and then accordingly you start preparing for GCP cloud. If you have already half way through with Azure devops then apply your transferable skills and learn GCP instead of learning GCP from the scratch.once you know the problem statement then your learning will be effective
05/03/20, 8:24 am - +1 (714) 757-8051: Make sense, thanks Joe!

05/03/20, 10:47 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: what is equivalent of cloudformation in google?
05/03/20, 10:49 am - +65 8482 8192: deployment manager
05/03/20, 10:50 am - +65 8482 8192: but in my experience terraform is widely used in both cloud
05/03/20, 10:52 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I have been hearing everyone is adopting this for for IaC...in CITI folks told me they are moving from AWS cloudformation templates  to terraform
05/03/20, 10:52 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: however, we are yet to see stable release of terraform
05/03/20, 10:52 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: until v1 .0 is out hard to say how this will shape up
05/03/20, 10:54 am - +65 8482 8192: that's shaping up well. perhaps from citi perspective c levels are not happy
05/03/20, 11:02 am - +65 8482 8192: reason being that it's very helpful on multi cloud environment.Its just that we will need to configure the respective parameters from the providers to reuse the same code in different cloud.
05/03/20, 11:04 am - +1 (818) 276-7875: Hey joe, myself yashwanth . Currently working as storage engineer consultant for US based clients. As of every thing is gng to be cloud. I felt there isn’t much scope in my domain. And also totally depending on infrastructure field I m not able to get proper exposure with software/applications fields. So, I want to learn cloud based technologies and do the automation stuff.

05/03/20, 11:23 am - +1 (818) 276-7875: I m trying to send the pub key to multiple to have passwd less communication b/w master and node using shell script. 

Actually what I did is
In ips.tx file I have listed the ips of hosts
Eg. 172.20.0.40
        172.20.0.41
         172.20.0.42

In another file I have a shell script as 

#! /bin/bash

for ip in ‘cat /home/ubuntu/ips’; do
      ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id.rsa.pub ubuntu@$ip
done
05/03/20, 11:23 am - +1 (818) 276-7875: But I’m getting an error as too many aruguments
05/03/20, 12:32 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Welcome! I think you were also a student of some training instistitue in India if I vividly remember 😄
Yes, only traditional infra is going down across industries and whatever left either going to be private cloud or outsourced 
This is the perfect time to learn devops and cloud 
The enterprise developers learning the infra and infra team learning about coding 
So it is like for the first time in the industry the love hate relationship  between dev and infra turning out to be we all br happy 😄
05/03/20, 12:33 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: @918400001004 can u help here...I know u can
05/03/20, 12:34 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: @919700462287 is busy preparing udemy courses but Narendra u solve our questions you will be producing coursera courses 😄

05/03/20, 8:55 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 😱
05/03/20, 8:56 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Well, they may hit me back by calling 'Slide Master' so I keep quiet.
05/03/20, 9:05 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I think we have few with AWS solution architect certified - Associate here in the group.

05/03/20, 9:43 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: dont buy first check with your company if your company have tie up with udemy for business if yes you may find this course free
05/03/20, 9:44 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: if ur company don't have then wait for the weekend offer and buy this..don't buy during weekdays...you will end up paying USD20 more
05/03/20, 9:45 pm - +65 8716 1050: Oh ok..

06/03/20, 12:12 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I will fly to Chicago this Sunday! They say Seattle became a ghost town (For 10 deaths in a nursing home) and few connecting services stopped. I fly direct to Chicago. If Chaos will become big, hopefully I will walk to Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada from Chicago and take a train from there to Vancouver.

06/03/20, 1:26 am - +44 7462 112282: I am also happy to join
06/03/20, 3:29 am - +65 9068 4521: This is what exactly happens in every project. Neither business tells what exactly they want Nor IT asks what business wants. We develop systems in assumption and that lands us this state. I am sure many will relate to this
06/03/20, 3:30 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 😀
06/03/20, 3:30 am - +65 9068 4521: Then comes post production fix and production support always claims that they are the best
06/03/20, 3:34 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: I did Production Support for 10 years and I was always the best. 😀
06/03/20, 3:35 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: No hands on for the last 12 years and do Architecture (Some call it 'Slide Master' or 'PPT guy') but I'm in peace.
06/03/20, 3:35 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: 9 to 5 - Nothing will stop if I broke - No one looks for me unless I go and see them. A blessed life. hahhaa
06/03/20, 3:51 am - +65 9068 4521: I really respect production support team all the time. They take shit from
business, from projects and from management. Very rarely they are recognised because they are not visible. Backbones make to stand straight, but are never visible and hence never get credit. It the skin which always takes the credit. And that’s the PPT all about. No offence to you Lawrence
06/03/20, 3:51 am - +65 9068 4521: You have done both and sure will appreciate
06/03/20, 3:55 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: No No, Not at all Sir. I just shared my thoughts. 😀
06/03/20, 3:56 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Truly, I don't like IT. 24 years gone. I imagine myself owning a bar and restaurant at Panama Canal in 2025. And have a boat. Learning Spanish now.
06/03/20, 3:58 am - +65 9068 4521: I have a friend who just did that. She left IT and opened a brewery in India. Now started a parlour for elite. And she is minting money. Not a bad idea Lawrence

Instead either use $(cat /somepath/file)

Or use

`cat /somepath/file`

Please note the difference between ' (single quote) and `(back tick)
06/03/20, 11:37 am - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Also, try this in cmd line

cwd=`pwd`

cwd=$(pwd)
echo $cwd

06/03/20, 1:12 pm - +44 7775 027250: Team, just like boto3 for AWS. Is there any python programming based google cloud training program in udemy or else where. Narendra's boto3 course in udemy was a massive and great help.
06/03/20, 1:23 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Underlying syntax,vocabulary,and usage will be same if u have learned boto3 with python 
In that sense try and find out what is the equivalent boto3 library in Google cloud and get some use case (problem statement) to practice
06/03/20, 1:23 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Dont start from scratch while learning all these...use transferable skills
06/03/20, 1:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Python is all about is knowing more libraries after u get handson with basic
06/03/20, 1:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: In that sense if I market my sessions then after u complete 5 sessions then you can navigate these 
06/03/20, 1:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Sometime I think if I can also create a udemy course on python with all clouds but it is not going to happen because of my day job situation
06/03/20, 1:26 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Today python session 5 starting at 10.30.pm Singapore time 
I will publish the meeting bridge soon
06/03/20, 2:04 pm - +44 7775 027250: Sure Joe
06/03/20, 3:09 pm - +91 95828 94296: Hi all , as per the project .. group 2 need to identify the testing strategy , so that it becomes slow
06/03/20, 3:09 pm - +91 95828 94296: That is kind of load test
06/03/20, 3:10 pm - +91 95828 94296: But how the website should respond if more traffic is introduced
06/03/20, 3:10 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: as discussed during last call, first we need to inherit some slowness using some CSS and then further from there
06/03/20, 3:11 pm - +91 95828 94296: This message was deleted
06/03/20, 3:11 pm - +91 95828 94296: It is a feature
06/03/20, 3:11 pm - +91 95828 94296: Css is not a way to slow down a website
06/03/20, 3:12 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: I am not into Client site dev exp but this is what I heard in the last call
06/03/20, 3:13 pm - +91 95828 94296: Ok .. let me say like this
06/03/20, 3:13 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: agenda was to load the first page itself with some lag and then extensive slowness will be achieved via some serverside response delaying approach
06/03/20, 3:13 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: if I understood it correct
06/03/20, 3:13 pm - +91 95828 94296: What is the benefit of doing this
06/03/20, 3:15 pm - +91 95828 94296: Ok let s say i achieve this by embedding heavy objects in page
06/03/20, 3:15 pm - +91 95828 94296: Is there any sample project
06/03/20, 3:16 pm - +91 95828 94296: Or i just need to give strategy   how to produce delay
06/03/20, 3:17 pm - +91 99451 41141: Performance lag should happen as more connections are made. It should be solvable with increasing CPU ,RAM
06/03/20, 3:18 pm - +91 95828 94296: In task manager process affinity can be reduced
06/03/20, 3:19 pm - +91 95828 94296: Through load , more hits can be performed
06/03/20, 3:19 pm - +91 95828 94296: Which in turn we say load test by jmeter
06/03/20, 3:19 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: yes, that's the goal to achieve finally. but for the beginning, I guess they wanted to slow it down using CSS
06/03/20, 3:20 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: not necessarily using CSS...we want to see the website is slow...
06/03/20, 3:20 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: how is the progress made in group 2 so far? looking at these discusions it appears to me work is starting now!
06/03/20, 3:21 pm - +91 95828 94296: Why you want slow website
06/03/20, 3:22 pm - Vijaya Mumbai DeVops: Hi we can use stress utility to slow down the server
06/03/20, 3:22 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: you guys do whatever you want to do to make the website slow first...that is the starting point
06/03/20, 3:23 pm - Vijaya Mumbai DeVops: Yes
06/03/20, 3:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: how is group 1 progressing so far?
06/03/20, 3:25 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: yes it's starting slowly and gradually, but picking up for sure
06/03/20, 3:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: ok buddy I trust you and I hate 11th hour always 
06/03/20, 3:27 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: noted
06/03/20, 3:27 pm - +91 95828 94296: Joe : what you want to achieve by making landing page slow
06/03/20, 3:28 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: if u in group 2 then talk to your group members buddy...we had an hour call explaining the use case
06/03/20, 3:29 pm - +91 95828 94296: Is there any seperate group .. i had asked this initially
06/03/20, 3:30 pm - +91 94380 04946: We have already prepared the technical design documents. Prem and Dinesh are working on the documentation now.
06/03/20, 3:32 pm - +91 95828 94296: Aashu if there is any seperate group , please let me know .. as i did not join from scratch . I might have more points
06/03/20, 3:32 pm - Aashu Devops Babies: okay Ashish
06/03/20, 4:01 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Folks - did any of you came across this scenario you have windows 2008 OS and want to enable TLS 1.2 with TIBCO middleware
06/03/20, 4:01 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: it is failing I was being told by all my friends in other banks and a friend in TIBCO that is is comptibility issue...
06/03/20, 4:02 pm - +65 8482 8192: we once disabled TLSs1.2 for web logic compatibility issue
06/03/20, 4:03 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: perfect...I got one additional confirmation here
06/03/20, 4:03 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: yeah ok that mean whether it is web logic or tibco it wont work with win 2008
06/03/20, 4:03 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: was it unix or win 08 in your case?
06/03/20, 4:03 pm - +65 8482 8192: windows 2008 r2
06/03/20, 4:04 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: ok super buddy...when we meet next time one whisky glass in my name under your credit card

06/03/20, 11:02 pm - Sanju Devops Babies: Hahaha😂😂😂
06/03/20, 11:12 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: while completing these assignments in python once again don't look solutions in google or stackoverflow except getting the syntax from the python doc - resist the temptation of finding code in these websites
06/03/20, 11:13 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: instead write pseduo code in a piece of paper or write code in paper then translate those using equivalent syntax in python in your computer
06/03/20, 11:13 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: whiteboard coding interview still continue to be in the industry due to some reason and this will help later

07/03/20, 12:01 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Folks - reflecting on container going down that will ultimately lose the data my thought 
While all the containers are running on production will there be a separate container as a backup ? So that if due to some reason 1 container goes down the other container is available ?
07/03/20, 12:08 pm - +91 99451 41141: That is taken care by kubernetes or ECS. I will address this when I do my session 
07/03/20, 12:10 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I see
07/03/20, 12:15 pm - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies:

07/03/20, 2:52 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I had read so many tutorials, watched vidoes and read articles but for the very first time I could able to understand what is a. POD 2.Docker 3. Contrainer 4. Kumbernetes ....and this is where Lawrence's first slide speak about removing complexity in these technical jargon world ! This is why Singlemalt will be always singlemalt afterall experience shine!
07/03/20, 2:53 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: will be shipped through a container service tonight then you can pull that image😋 learning docker now
07/03/20, 2:58 pm - +65 8381 5514: Yeah, indeed it was very clear and detailed. we could intake like water

Same case with python sessions also,
Thanks Joe & Lowrance 
We all new babies are blessfull of your knowledge sharing and mentoring us
07/03/20, 3:13 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: whether it is AWS or Google one thing is confusing is how they proclaim the availability zones for example aws says three availability zones does that mean there are multiple data centers within these 3 availability zones? I doubt then does this mean one availability zone could be one data center based on scale of size of a country like Singapore, possibly ? But need validation on my assumption
07/03/20, 3:14 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: For example, Google this week announced 2 regions one in India (New Delhi) and one in Australia but how many data centers within this regions coming up is not very clear
07/03/20, 3:15 pm - +65 8381 5514: each availability zone one data centre
07/03/20, 3:15 pm - +91 91824 13490: You are absolutely understood it correctly sir. AWS tries to maintain at least 3 Data centers in each region, Availability zone is nothing but a physical data centers
07/03/20, 3:15 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: no there is one t many relationship
07/03/20, 3:15 pm - +91 99451 41141: Small correction.
07/03/20, 3:16 pm - +91 91824 13490: 1 Availability zone = 1 Data Center
07/03/20, 3:16 pm - +91 99451 41141: An availability zone is collection of one or many datacenters. Let me explain
07/03/20, 3:17 pm - +91 98104 56274: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3133524/what-s-better-amazon-s-availability-zones-vs-microsoft-azure-s-regions.html
07/03/20, 3:18 pm - +91 98104 56274: Explains az and regions for aws n azure
07/03/20, 3:18 pm - +91 98104 56274: This should clear
07/03/20, 3:18 pm - +91 98104 56274: AWS uses what are called Availability Zones (AZs) as the basis for its cloud. Each region in AWS is made up of at least two AZs. Microsoft, instead, just uses regions; it does not guarantee that each region will have multiple data centers. It’s a fundamental difference in the way these IaaS platforms are constructed
07/03/20, 3:19 pm - +91 99451 41141: Datacenter is a room full of servers. So Let's say 1st floor , 2nd floor every floor in a 10 story building is a Datacenter.

Like that building 1+ building 2+building 3 in one area (say in Andheri Mumbai) .

This is 1 Availability zone
07/03/20, 3:20 pm - +91 99451 41141: Like that 50km away 2or3 buildings full of datacenters is Availability zone 2
07/03/20, 3:20 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: what is the minimum distance between these 3 buildings ?
07/03/20, 3:21 pm - +91 99451 41141: 50Km
07/03/20, 3:22 pm - +91 99451 41141: Meaning inside the AZ they are adacent buildings.
07/03/20, 3:22 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 🤔 whole singapore is 24 KM (east-west) and 42KM (north-south)
07/03/20, 3:23 pm - +91 99451 41141: Yeah close to that. I sent you once exact address of each AZ which was leaked on internet
07/03/20, 3:23 pm - +91 91824 13490: Cloud providers tries to maintain far as away to each data centers...based on the area of the region...
07/03/20, 3:23 pm - +91 91824 13490: in US it is minimum of 100 KMs
07/03/20, 3:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: yeah, I looked at that and it sounds like 3 availability zones are 3 individual data center (applicable to Singapore)
07/03/20, 3:25 pm - +91 99451 41141: https://wikileaks.org/amazon-atlas/map/
07/03/20, 3:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: when aws sign a contract what is the SLA they are willing put in the paper for signing when it comes to these availability Zones...as a customer can we demands to know which datacenter the servers are hosted? or AWS will refuse to share that?
07/03/20, 3:26 pm - +91 99451 41141: You can choose to keep your servers separate by selecting AZ1 or AZ2
07/03/20, 3:27 pm - +91 99451 41141: For example, Singapore. ap-southeast-1a ap-southeast-1b
07/03/20, 3:28 pm - +91 99451 41141: Tell me this, don't they run cloud sessions in your office? I am sure they should be using many cloud and those vendors run these sessions? Curious
07/03/20, 3:31 pm - +91 99451 41141: Fyi, AWS recently announced another concept called Local zones
07/03/20, 3:31 pm - +91 99451 41141: Might help to Know for exam
07/03/20, 3:32 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: in our office we don't get such visibility...we get these as a service from the group who are running these with them....
07/03/20, 3:33 pm - +91 99451 41141: Ok
07/03/20, 3:35 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: let me see if spin ball works and hit the middle wicket...
07/03/20, 3:38 pm - +65 8381 5514: You already that - entire globe here in this group
In out office, when i enquired, they have plan this to get aws guys for couple of days sessions but not sure what departments they will cover
07/03/20, 3:48 pm - +91 91824 13490: Sorry guys I was wrong...
1 Availability zone = 1 or more DCs
Thanks Pranesh for correcting

08/03/20, 7:56 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: excellent ! before you share the code if you could export the group message and see wherever NA is there for the phone numbers and let me know which are those and if in the Name column is is showing NA because you have stored the number in your mobile phone
08/03/20, 7:57 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Then write a recon script to see who didn't put a single message in the group yet against your database result and we remove all those silent readers from this group
08/03/20, 7:59 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 114 people in the group (after I cleaned up few yesterday night) then once you run your recon script we will do more cleanup....
08/03/20, 8:05 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Linux Gurus - in LinkedIn there is a joke going on ...can you help us to know more about this
08/03/20, 8:05 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Sudo rm -rf /bin/
08/03/20, 8:05 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: what it does ? why people are laughing in linkedin on a statement 'it makes computer faster'
08/03/20, 8:06 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: rf mean remove a file and Sudo mean login as a root account but I could not understood what is under the hood
08/03/20, 8:10 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: /bin has the package for me command. That may be the reason.
08/03/20, 8:10 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: For *rm Command
08/03/20, 8:12 am - +91 99451 41141: It's a self suicide
08/03/20, 8:13 am - +1 (347) 753-7530: Yes deletes all the files with sub folder
08/03/20, 8:14 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: I thought rf means remove recursively and force but the /bin/ makes no sense
08/03/20, 8:19 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Pranesh. What's the difference between Suicide and Self-Suicide?
08/03/20, 8:20 am - +91 99451 41141: Just a joke. 😀 .
08/03/20, 8:20 am - +1 (347) 753-7530: 😀

Self-Suicide is different and unique. I can use it somewhere.
08/03/20, 8:26 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Suicide : Love Marriage Self-Suicide: Arranged Marriage

08/03/20, 8:50 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: That code is working but I'm still figuring out how do we get a API access...the problem with current code is everytime u run the python program it will ask to scan the QR code...I reached out to few folks(I don't them though via linkedin) working in facebook but nobody replied...let's see if I can crack this question 'how do we get API access to whatsapp'...tried business account but that doesn't resolve the problem
08/03/20, 8:52 am - +1 (682) 221-2388: We'll eventually get over it
08/03/20, 8:53 am - +1 (510) 646-7148: This message was deleted
08/03/20, 9:02 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: extract from internet on my sunday morning reading
08/03/20, 9:02 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: you should be very clear on the scope of responsibilities for the platform team vs its customers - which I’ll call application teams for clarity.

Application teams build, deploy, monitor, and are on call for the application components and application infrastructure that they provision and deploy on the platform. Platform teams build, deploy, monitor, and are on call for the platform components and underlying platform infrastructure.

The platform team ideally doesn’t even know what applications are running on the platform, they are only responsible for the availability of the platform services themselves.

In this way both application teams and platform teams have responsibility for build and run of their own products. ‘You build it, you run it’ still applies.

08/03/20, 9:08 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: great reads about DevOps
08/03/20, 9:08 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: coming back to our self-learning on DevOps and Cloud - few things to reflect
08/03/20, 9:09 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 1. Who is your end-user or client?
08/03/20, 9:09 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 2. In cloud and devops whatever task you do how is it making an impact to $ value to the organization
08/03/20, 9:11 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 3. How your company look at these functions or newly created teams like 'Devops team' or 'Cloud Team' or 'Transformation Team'? Do these teams have enough support from the management and budget? How strategic are these functions or roles?
08/03/20, 9:11 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: start research on these as a top-down approach first before learning the plethora of Devops tools...
08/03/20, 9:14 am - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Ok Joe
08/03/20, 9:48 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Linkedin is a good platform! yesterday, I tried this. Here is the background...in a quest to find out the answer on DC and AZ...reached out to a person who managed the actual data center for one of the cloud...spoke with him just now and here is the summary
08/03/20, 9:48 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: AZ = Multiple DC
08/03/20, 9:49 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Singapore is unique situation and though AWS, Google, and Microsoft have 1 to 3 AZ but in the backend there are multiple physical DC
08/03/20, 9:50 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: in Singapore it is also required because in order to run a DC the max electricity required is 66K which is hard to get fro service providers in Singapore and hence there are multiple DC in the backend...
08/03/20, 9:50 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: These cloud providers also develop something internal solution to supply power to these servers something like ATS
08/03/20, 9:51 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: a typical electricy flip can happen over 0.5 milli secornd to 0.25 millsecond but these internal power solution like ATS can support upto 0.02 Milliseconds so servers would not know there was a powerflip
08/03/20, 9:54 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: We will have this person in our group tomorrow once he get a clearance from his legal and compliance team...I told him we are a non-profit and with no commercial objective in mind and learning cloud and devops technology stack...it was well received by him and he appreciated our effort and quest to gain knowledge in this way and my unique way of approaching him

08/03/20, 4:10 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 3 questions for u for thoughts 
1. Why someone will hire you in your preferred city in Europe 
2. Are you in the 1% of the demand group known as pull factor when companies will look for hiring 
3. Do u know 5 senior managers there who have decision making powers (when i say decision making mean they say to their team go and hire this x person and x person getting job, no interviews)
08/03/20, 4:12 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Send me ur resume at joemtech75@gmail.com to get a free 1st level feedback 😀 no no free after lent send me a bottle of blue label.

08/03/20, 5:16 pm - +91 95828 94296: Registered , thanks
08/03/20, 5:23 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: In your resume under work experience don't list down your current roles and responsibilities in bullet point and repeat the same over jobs and jobs...after 18-20 seconds hiring managers are not interested to read line by line what you have highlighted as series of responsibilities
08/03/20, 5:23 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: instead think and highlight if you have done something specific that have resulted in some productivity gains, automation etc...
08/03/20, 5:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: write something like thing
08/03/20, 5:24 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: implemented automation scripts that resulted in x% productivity gain for the team
08/03/20, 5:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: recommended suggestions that was implemented to reduce the batch runs by x number of hours
08/03/20, 5:25 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: you get the idea...
08/03/20, 5:26 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: every hiring manager know what is a developer day to day responsibility or a production support analyst day to day role or a cloud or infra person roles and responsibility
08/03/20, 5:28 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: a resume or cv is a quick entry point to the hiring manager to decide whether he/she need to call you for an interview---it should not be more than 2 pages and don't feel anxious if a resume is just a one page resume...hiring managers are perfectly ok to see a one page resume noone is counting the number of pages in a resume it is not like our old school days when your school class mate ask for 'additional paper' while writing exam...I'm sure all of you would have seen that in your class...

08/03/20, 7:55 pm - +65 8381 5514: Thanks Joe & prem for your valuable feedback and suggestions!!
08/03/20, 7:55 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: few folks got enrolled into training institutes let's hear from them if they had ever came across such type of deep discussions 
08/03/20, 7:56 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: I was a bug in the discusssion  real stuff came from Prem!
08/03/20, 7:57 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: The discussion makes someone feel like being in the industry already and discussing a highly architected framework on AWS in a team
08/03/20, 7:59 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: we are now going to kick off with another project on DevOps and for that the mentors are Nachu (SG), Vineet(IN), sugadev(SG), avinash(SG) and amit(UK)...these folks will guide us how to build end to end CI/CD pipelines with use cases
08/03/20, 8:00 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: Thanks alot Prem for your time and input to make this happen, and Joe the way u always coordinate the meetings is amazing, you asks real time questions that help some folks like us with less cloud experience to understand the Architecture much better
08/03/20, 8:00 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: It is going to be hectic and fun for the next 3-4 months after that future is bright ! we will will get jobs!
08/03/20, 8:01 pm - +1 (682) 221-2388: 👔🎓🍾
08/03/20, 8:06 pm - +65 9773 4599: I know u guys are rocking.. trying hard to catch up

08/03/20, 8:55 pm - +1 (614) 589-7721: Very well documented. My 2 cents: replacing ec2:DB servers with AWS Dynamo DB would reduce a mgmt. Layer and give you the flexibility of Autoscaling. If the design is not to store key value pairs and have multiple table config then I agree with the design. Thoughts?
08/03/20, 9:03 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Guys,
Can I have some python enthusiast from the team who can work with me on below activities.

1. Filter chat data to extract links,images and docs data....we might need to get into some concepts of data partion and multi part creation of data to store PDFs and all.

2. Filter out dormant people from the group

3. Going forward implement machine and nlp to get those people highlighted who can be dormant after how much time after joining the group.
08/03/20, 9:04 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: On point 1

Dev team guys can help us with multi partion and partition of data
08/03/20, 9:04 pm - +65 8381 5514: Thanks Sunder, dynamodb ia good candidate for requirements, but we want to manage data security on our own & also as part this project we want explore a secured db component hence chosen ec2-db(mongodb).
08/03/20, 9:05 pm - +91 80561 63055: How's chat data getting stored? Json or XML or some other format? We can use BeautifulSoup to get the tags we want.
08/03/20, 9:06 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: I can let you know in sometime..
08/03/20, 9:09 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 2 and 3 is overkill for the assignment... on 2 do one thing write a recon script or just use join to filter out dormant phone numbers (means folks who have not responded on anything) starting 7 Jan 2020
08/03/20, 9:11 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: 3 is a very vast subject...we will be working machine learning and NLP towards the end of the project on a use case that I'm coming that is about capacity planning, cpu utilisation, availability and predictability stuff...it is called AI in Devops
08/03/20, 9:12 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: on point 1 - we have a game developer here in this group from HYD...speak with him to get some info or speak with @917979082525
08/03/20, 9:20 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Thanks Joe

@917979082525 I will be in touch with you very soon for point 1
08/03/20, 9:21 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Sure Joe...we will keep this for later stage
08/03/20, 9:40 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Should I loop you @918056163055  also along with @917979082525 ??
08/03/20, 10:12 pm - +91 80561 63055: Yeah I'm in

09/03/20, 11:05 am - +65 8482 8192: your last 2 lines  🤭
09/03/20, 11:06 am - +65 8482 8192: in my job hunt experience in UK sponsor is the most hated word for employers and IR35 for employees and employers
09/03/20, 11:09 am - +44 7775 027250: I know that's a nightmare,  but I was lucky to get sponsorship from RBS and Deloitte. It's all depends on your skill set and project requirement.
09/03/20, 11:09 am - +44 7775 027250: True 
09/03/20, 11:11 am - +65 8482 8192: very true. everyone's got a unique experience.

09/03/20, 2:36 pm - +91 91824 13490: Hi Sampath, Welcome to the World of "DevOps & Cloud Babies"
If I am not wrong ECS is Elastic Cloud Storage a Product of Dell EMC
09/03/20, 2:37 pm - +65 8381 5514: ECS : elastic container service - AWS
09/03/20, 2:37 pm - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: No no 
ECS means Elachi contained somosa
09/03/20, 2:38 pm - +91 91824 13490: Hahahaha hahahaha😂😂
09/03/20, 2:46 pm - +91 88247 73328: Hahaha
09/03/20, 2:56 pm - +1 (818) 276-7875: Even I thought the same thing... where it is mostly used for archival purpose.
09/03/20, 3:00 pm - +91 98846 44330: ECS is Citi terminology of Enterprise Container Solution..
09/03/20, 3:15 pm - +91 91824 13490: Ok
09/03/20, 3:23 pm - +91 91824 13490: No my friend..Not only for archival, it is a complete cloud solution like AWS, gcp and Azure...
09/03/20, 3:25 pm - +91 91824 13490: So, is it same as Docker?..or more secure and faster than any other container technologies
09/03/20, 3:34 pm - +1 (818) 276-7875: Yes true.. but in my previous project.. They were  using ECS it archival purpose..since Centera was end of life support by Dell EMC..

6. Can we configure different Jenkins agent on different stages of Jenkin pipeline....how?
09/03/20, 9:49 pm - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: There is no necessity to deploy an OS and then tomcat infact you can directly pull tomcat image which will have libs and dependencies.

Pulling tomcat image is infact better option as you will be optimising your image by 1 layer which might contain extra unused libs and dependencies. Also, this should keep size of your images smaller

10/03/20, 7:55 am - +91 89750 03417: https://devops.com/top-six-open-source-tools-for-monitoring-kubernetes-and-docker/
10/03/20, 8:08 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Sorry to say, Yashwanth. your question do not make any sense to me. However, here's the high level information.

1. Docker Engine = Docker Community Edition = Docker Software = Docker Container
2. A Container is bit like a Virtual machine. A virtual machine holds 100% of operating system but the container holders just 10% of operating system since it shares the Kernel of the host. The host can be a physical server or Virtual Machine.
3. Every application needs an Operating system to run. Therefore, Tomcat needs an OS to run inside the Container.

It is important for you to learn basics of Containers, Practice then get into release management topics. Good luck.

Guys, I need feedback on this so that I can continue with Day1 portion of docker
11/03/20, 2:26 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Good article Vineet. Few suggestions below.

1. Add VMware, Hyper-V, KVM in the timeline. See if you can add IBM LPAR (Father of Virtualization from 1972).

2. At the end 'Conclusion' section is important. 

3. I assume you want to write a series like Day 0, Day 1 etc. Therefore, it is nice to write 2-3 lines
 about what readers can expect at Day 1 article. It usually should come after Conclusion section.

5. At the end, always write about you in few lines, add social links, or website.

Good effort. Keep writing.
11/03/20, 2:27 am - Vineet Devops Intellipaat: Thanks Lawrence...much appreciated your efforts in reviewing this. I will update this with above suggestions 
11/03/20, 2:39 am - Lawrence Dev Ops Cloud Babies: Any time 
11/03/20, 10:06 am - Joe-Devops Cloud Babies: Great! Keep writing. Some feedback: 
Start with a problem statement keeping end user pain points in view and how these will solve the pain points
This is missing in articles in the internet when people write about all these stuff 
Try to use as much as layman language while explaining the stuffs to keep your audience engaged

In my company we use  bash scripts which helps creating vm for a required client which take care of the vpc, firewall rules etc from a template. Can someone advise if Terraform is self sufficient to manage say your Azure based infrastructure or do we need to write custom python/bash scripts which then is called by Terraform to do some activity which Terraform can't as product. FYI- I'm planning to learn Terraform and  take a project on replicating one of our regional infrastructure. So, wanted to get some first hand experience.

When the Dhirubhai Ambani business empire was divided between Mukesh and Anil Ambani, Anil started with a net worth of USD 31,000,000,000. In just over a decade, he has lost 99% of his net worth, haemorrhaging at the rate of Rs. 58 crores per day for 123 months...

The younger brother defaulted loan & sold company to elder brother to repay loan. 

The elder brother took loan from same bank to take over the younger brother's company. 

Now the bank got reduced NPA with stronger loan book. Nothing came or gone despite everything got good. 

Company Share prices got doubled in a week.
Mukesh allowed Anil to announce bad news and drop the share prices. The public sold off and Mukesh bought the shares (through loan) at dead cheap prices. Now prices are high. He pays off the loan to the bank by transferring it shares or with partners/partial sell in public. He has a company at zero cost.

Now who is the loser ?
Anil Ambani - No ( He got sufficient money to pay his loan )
Mukesh Ambani - No ( He got a good company at throw away price and he is going to mint money out of that )
Bank :  No ( They got their money back with interest )
You, the public is the loser who invest in share market..!

All done legally 

That's how true  industrialist  use share market to earn profit from public..! And normal public keep investing in share market 😄😄

A fantastic illusion we live in ...hats off...😀
