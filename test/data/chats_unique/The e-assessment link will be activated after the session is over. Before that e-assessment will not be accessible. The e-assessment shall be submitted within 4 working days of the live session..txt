06/07/20, 12:10 - +91 98805 14705: Dear HOD, 
@ all students 4th semester C Section 

LA1 component for DBMS was conducted during regular college hours . Since most of them got less marks they requested for re-conduction  of LA1 . On their (students) request and at their convenient time LA1 was re-conducted again . This time they (Students) had isuues in submission and problems of their own . So, I was made to conduct the same LA1 for the third time . Even after that , now again few have queries with respect to different question paper. Because of which I asked their convenient time to conduct the LA1 for the 4th time . Where, I told this would be the final and it’s compulsory for all . Portions being that same as MSE -I . 
But, again they have problem with this also . I have conducted the LA1 all the time ON THEIR REQUEST.  Please suggest what should be done now
06/07/20, 12:11 - +91 98805 14705: Dear Students, 

Please tell me ,you have  give LA 1 componentfor DBMS theory 3 times . That was on my request or your request?
06/07/20, 12:12 - Aditi Nmit Cse: Since we had scored less in the test given in college, we requested for another test online after mse ma'am

06/07/20, 12:13 - +91 98805 14705: Every time the test was conducted from students point of view . Where in we considered all your requests . Even now we are doing the same thing .
06/07/20, 12:15 - +91 98805 14705: So now I will be considering the LA1 which was conducted during the regular college hours so that you people need not take the trouble of giving the test again .  Thank You
