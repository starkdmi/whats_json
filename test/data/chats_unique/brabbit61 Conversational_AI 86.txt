24/12/2018, 16:35 - Vidit Avasthi: But he still won't admit defeat
24/12/2018, 16:35 - Vidit Avasthi: Tell his friend that you're reporting bc you don't want to resort to photoshop
24/12/2018, 16:46 - Jenit Jain: I've sent him a text
24/12/2018, 16:46 - Jenit Jain: Based on the reply actually report kar lete hai

24/12/2018, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: But legally, he gave a certificate right
24/12/2018, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: So all we have is the screenshot
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Vidit Avasthi: No since he's threatened you that he'll spoil your certificate in the past
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Vidit Avasthi: It's inadmissible
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Vidit Avasthi: And the screenshots support that you did well
24/12/2018, 17:01 - Vidit Avasthi: So it holds
24/12/2018, 17:01 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm just wondering if you can report him without bringing up anything else
24/12/2018, 17:01 - Vidit Avasthi: We'll have to come up w a way
24/12/2018, 17:02 - Jenit Jain: What do you mean

24/12/2018, 17:41 - Jenit Jain: And how come I'm not following you in insta
24/12/2018, 17:45 - Vidit Avasthi: I removed you bc you are not worthy
24/12/2018, 17:45 - Vidit Avasthi: :p
24/12/2018, 17:46 - Vidit Avasthi: Baitha reh ab

24/12/2018, 17:47 - Jenit Jain: Kyu bc
24/12/2018, 17:47 - Jenit Jain: And what about the WhatsApp group
24/12/2018, 18:35 - Jenit Jain: Accha Bata Kya likhu certificate par
24/12/2018, 18:36 - Jenit Jain: I'm getting it done now
24/12/2018, 18:40 - Jenit Jain: Oyee
24/12/2018, 21:22 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
24/12/2018, 21:22 - Jenit Jain: Is this fine
24/12/2018, 21:23 - Vidit Avasthi: Looks photoshopped
24/12/2018, 21:23 - Vidit Avasthi: The H and R in Marwah Road is cropped on the top right
24/12/2018, 21:23 - Vidit Avasthi: The spacing between sentences isn't equal in the first paragraph
24/12/2018, 21:24 - Vidit Avasthi: Also the address should start one line below to be directly opposite and central to the line on the left
24/12/2018, 21:24 - Vidit Avasthi: Physiz logo is cropped
24/12/2018, 21:25 - Vidit Avasthi: Also you will never talk to the guy who helped you out in the company
24/12/2018, 21:25 - Vidit Avasthi: He has no business knowing whether you photoshopped your letter or not
24/12/2018, 21:26 - Vidit Avasthi: If he asks
Tell him you decided to do away with the letter
24/12/2018, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: Yes
24/12/2018, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: Do away?
24/12/2018, 21:26 - Vidit Avasthi: That you got one from your dad's company
24/12/2018, 21:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Redo the certificate nonetheless
24/12/2018, 21:27 - Vidit Avasthi: While it's unlikely to be scrutinized the way I'm scrutinizing it
I doubt it can pass a second glance from an amateur
24/12/2018, 21:27 - Jenit Jain: I'll get it redone
24/12/2018, 21:27 - Jenit Jain: Thanks man
24/12/2018, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: Dude
24/12/2018, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: All this was fucked up in original PDF also
24/12/2018, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: What should I do
24/12/2018, 21:39 - Vidit Avasthi: Wing it
24/12/2018, 21:39 - Vidit Avasthi: They will first see the spacing between lines
24/12/2018, 21:39 - Vidit Avasthi: Doubt that and then look to the other things to decide if it's fake or not
24/12/2018, 21:39 - Vidit Avasthi: Leave the logo as it is
24/12/2018, 21:39 - Vidit Avasthi: Fix everything else
24/12/2018, 21:39 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
24/12/2018, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: Iska sab there hai upar ka
24/12/2018, 21:40 - Vidit Avasthi: Use it
24/12/2018, 21:40 - Vidit Avasthi: And still bring the address one line below to align it
24/12/2018, 21:42 - Jenit Jain: Woh ab nahi hoga, see in this also it's one line above
24/12/2018, 21:43 - Vidit Avasthi: You know that's how it is
24/12/2018, 21:43 - Vidit Avasthi: Someone suspecting forgery will see it as a discrepancy
24/12/2018, 21:43 - Vidit Avasthi: Dekh le tu
24/12/2018, 21:44 - Jenit Jain: Theek hai
24/12/2018, 22:04 - Jenit Jain: Spacing in this is fully justified and not left ident, so uneven spaces thing is fine
25/12/2018, 16:14 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
28/12/2018, 18:46 - Jenit Jain: Did you even understand what I was trying to say
28/12/2018, 18:46 - Vidit Avasthi: No I stopped reading
28/12/2018, 18:46 - Vidit Avasthi: Khola nahi ab tak
28/12/2018, 18:46 - Vidit Avasthi: But no I won't listen
28/12/2018, 18:47 - Jenit Jain: Man all I'm saying is that yes I know I lost. I agree. Don't give me a hard time for it because you are one of the reasons it started too. Moreover, stop patronizing me.
28/12/2018, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Tumlog se aisa expected nahi hai
28/12/2018, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: I never said you lost too, we would have won if we did everything you said, true, but thoda realistic baneka
28/12/2018, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: Thoda stress le life mei and jeet ke dikha
28/12/2018, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: Rather than being afraid of taking it far
28/12/2018, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: Nothing worthy comes easy
28/12/2018, 18:52 - Jenit Jain: Like you said, college ke internship se  ghanta kuch nahi hota. Doesn't make sense risking even the minimum for this bs
28/12/2018, 18:52 - Jenit Jain: Aage Jake sab karege
28/12/2018, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: Me closing down a company with your help whose capital is less than what either of spend in a short time isn't worth jack.
28/12/2018, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: I'm not even of the age where my stress should include courts, cases, imprisonment of anyone
28/12/2018, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Bc exams dedu acchese kafi hai
28/12/2018, 18:56 - Vidit Avasthi: Dude I don't care mujhe kyun bata raha hai
28/12/2018, 18:56 - Vidit Avasthi: We didn't even say anything that you bent over for him
28/12/2018, 18:56 - Vidit Avasthi: We said it bc of you saying that he learnt a lesson too
28/12/2018, 18:57 - Vidit Avasthi: Faltu khwaab na dekh usne jhaat nahi seekha
28/12/2018, 18:57 - Vidit Avasthi: Bas utne ke liye suna tu
28/12/2018, 18:57 - Jenit Jain: I just meant about the not sharing drugs with interns part. I specified that also
28/12/2018, 18:58 - Jenit Jain: Tu zyada karleta hai
28/12/2018, 18:58 - Jenit Jain: Dekh le Kya Kya bola hai
28/12/2018, 18:58 - Vidit Avasthi: Bc I'm confident I can win
Bc I'm not Afraid of what I'll have to do to win
28/12/2018, 18:58 - Vidit Avasthi: No win comes from a smooth road
28/12/2018, 18:58 - Vidit Avasthi: But it's your life
28/12/2018, 18:59 - Vidit Avasthi: I get it if you don't want to
28/12/2018, 18:59 - Vidit Avasthi: But kisi din karna padega
28/12/2018, 18:59 - Vidit Avasthi: Chutiye se log tujhe push karte hain aage kya hoga
28/12/2018, 18:59 - Jenit Jain: I know Bhai par only I'll have to face the repercussions  na
28/12/2018, 18:59 - Jenit Jain: I don't mind that day
28/12/2018, 19:00 - Jenit Jain: 2 months ki internship ke liye kyu time waste karna hai
28/12/2018, 19:00 - Jenit Jain: Chill karna
28/12/2018, 19:00 - Jenit Jain: I've been thankful for all you've done.
28/12/2018, 19:00 - Jenit Jain: It's just that you need to start controlling your mouth.
28/12/2018, 19:01 - Vidit Avasthi: I really won't
28/12/2018, 19:01 - Vidit Avasthi: Not even a bit
28/12/2018, 19:01 - Jenit Jain: Theek hai phir Kya bolu tujhe
28/12/2018, 19:01 - Vidit Avasthi: There is a place to shutup
28/12/2018, 19:01 - Vidit Avasthi: And that place wasn't it
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Vidit Avasthi: Woh ladka kuch bhi bol raha tha and tu sun raha tha
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm not even slightly sorry for what I said
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Jenit Jain: Okay you misunderstood me.
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm only sorry that we didn't shut him
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Jenit Jain: Not shut up to him
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Jenit Jain: You should see what you were telling me.
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Jenit Jain: On the group
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Jenit Jain: Uska soch ke bolneka
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Vidit Avasthi: I meant every word
28/12/2018, 19:02 - Vidit Avasthi: If you can't go all way, don't commit in the start
28/12/2018, 19:03 - Jenit Jain: To him, even I'm not. I had a good laugh. Worth every penny
28/12/2018, 19:03 - Vidit Avasthi: Nothing that I do is conventional
28/12/2018, 19:03 - Vidit Avasthi: Conventional ends up average
28/12/2018, 19:03 - Vidit Avasthi: Average is middle class
28/12/2018, 19:03 - Vidit Avasthi: Not good enough
28/12/2018, 19:04 - Vidit Avasthi: My sister is like you gets pushed around, school jaake dhamkaya they sucked my toes on the spot
28/12/2018, 19:04 - Jenit Jain: Haan theek hai. It's not like you lost anything. So why condescend for the sake of doing so.
28/12/2018, 19:04 - Vidit Avasthi: Kutton ke saath insaan ki tarah baat nahi kar sakte
28/12/2018, 19:04 - Jenit Jain: You already know I lost and uske baat Tera bhi sunu
28/12/2018, 19:04 - Jenit Jain: Chutiya nahi hu

28/12/2018, 19:04 - Vidit Avasthi: Haar na maana bakchodi hai
28/12/2018, 19:06 - Jenit Jain: Losing a small meaningless battle with a twat so that nothing crucial is risked is totally fine by me.
28/12/2018, 19:06 - Jenit Jain: Chutiya koi acchi cheez bigad de, woh zyada bura lagega
28/12/2018, 19:06 - Jenit Jain: Woh soch

04/07/2019, 08:46 - Vidit Avasthi: Uth bc
05/07/2019, 07:25 - Vidit Avasthi: Bro
Log jis frame of mind mei rash decision lete hain
Is not their permanent state of mind
05/07/2019, 07:25 - Vidit Avasthi: But if you beg in this moment then you'll turn her conviction solid
05/07/2019, 07:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Rn she needs time off for her mind to balance out her feelings
05/07/2019, 07:26 - Vidit Avasthi: I know this is huge for you and a nightmare
05/07/2019, 07:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Any act on impulse will only harm this for you
05/07/2019, 07:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Speaking from experience
05/07/2019, 07:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Lubaba bhi mera kaati thi 3 saal baad mei bhi roya tha instead of taking charge and aaj tak regret karta hoon
05/07/2019, 07:27 - Vidit Avasthi: Roz sapna aata hai ki uska Instagram verify ho gaya and mere discover pe aa rahi hai
05/07/2019, 07:27 - Jenit Jain: She's like I refuse to learn long distance and she can't go through it again and she doesn't asking formpermission from me
05/07/2019, 07:27 - Jenit Jain: Kaha permission yaar
05/07/2019, 07:27 - Jenit Jain: Molesters me saath Bahar jayegi
05/07/2019, 07:27 - Jenit Jain: Idk what to say react feel think
05/07/2019, 07:28 - Vidit Avasthi: Okay look
2 outlooks on this
1) if she still wants to hang w weird people then you may have no choice but to say absolutely nothing when she does
2) You have to recognise realistically that maybe you actually are very different people
05/07/2019, 07:29 - Vidit Avasthi: After all people do change through their years in college, you may not be the same people you were when you first met
05/07/2019, 07:29 - Vidit Avasthi: But right now, do not act on impulse
05/07/2019, 07:29 - Vidit Avasthi: There is absolutely nothing that you can do that time can't
05/07/2019, 07:29 - Jenit Jain: But we changed and grew together man
05/07/2019, 07:29 - Jenit Jain: I've already a cepted this
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: Man it's not even her, girls for some reason can't think for themselves
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: It's always a group effort
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: Mummy kuch aur bolegi
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: Best friend kuch aur bolegi
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: And ladki convince ho jayegi
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: And nothing that you say can help that
05/07/2019, 07:30 - Vidit Avasthi: The ONLY thing you can do is use time to specifically trigger her feelings
05/07/2019, 07:31 - Vidit Avasthi: Honestly it's a really fucked up mind game that people look down upon but that doesn't mean it doesn't work
05/07/2019, 07:31 - Vidit Avasthi: And there are very real ways to trigger a girl's feelings
05/07/2019, 07:31 - Vidit Avasthi: But you'll have to take the time to do those things
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Jenit Jain: I can't go through that phase
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Jenit Jain: I was supposed to marry this girl
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Jenit Jain: We knew how many kids we were gonna have
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Vidit Avasthi: When she posts something
Don't like it immediately
Wait until it's late night and you know she's alone and then like it so your name stands out on her screen
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Jenit Jain: I know location of our marriage
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Jenit Jain: And iske baad I'm expected to trigger feelings
05/07/2019, 07:32 - Vidit Avasthi: Start typing on snapchat and never send anything
Like old pictures of her
At very specific times
05/07/2019, 07:33 - Vidit Avasthi: Man these things work
05/07/2019, 07:33 - Vidit Avasthi: All you have to do is stay relevant and trigger her within short bursts of time to maximize thoughts about you in her alone time
05/07/2019, 07:33 - Vidit Avasthi: That's the only way to undo what a girl hears from her surroundings
05/07/2019, 07:34 - Vidit Avasthi: It's basically a science man it may sound stupid but manipulating a brain is the best way to get anything done
05/07/2019, 07:34 - Vidit Avasthi: Just take the time for it
05/07/2019, 07:34 - Vidit Avasthi: I can't say anything to make you feel better about this
But I can show you an action plan on how to play this
05/07/2019, 07:35 - Jenit Jain: Not much left for me so might as well
05/07/2019, 07:35 - Vidit Avasthi: You know how you ask why a guy like me gets as much fanatical love
05/07/2019, 07:35 - Vidit Avasthi: It's because I don't let them forget me
05/07/2019, 07:35 - Vidit Avasthi: It's honestly sick, the way I do it
05/07/2019, 07:35 - Vidit Avasthi: But if you use it right then it's not a bad thing at all
05/07/2019, 07:36 - Vidit Avasthi: Remember that someone manipulates her thoughts is why this happened
05/07/2019, 07:36 - Vidit Avasthi: So nothing that you can say will undo that, only your return moves will
05/07/2019, 07:37 - Vidit Avasthi: Hell even I'll post pictures w you late in the night to flash on her screen
05/07/2019, 07:38 - Jenit Jain: She's like no. That just mean she really has been giving a lot of thought to this
05/07/2019, 07:39 - Vidit Avasthi: Do you think it's realistic that all of it is her original wish?
05/07/2019, 07:39 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm actually asking, not being condescending
05/07/2019, 07:39 - Jenit Jain: She has been saying how much last sem affected her and how she can't get over it
05/07/2019, 07:39 - Jenit Jain: Multiple times
05/07/2019, 07:40 - Jenit Jain: And this vacation she barely texted
05/07/2019, 07:40 - Vidit Avasthi: Man sometimes people just get put off by routine
05/07/2019, 07:40 - Jenit Jain: Half things I found from her Snapchat
05/07/2019, 07:40 - Vidit Avasthi: And in those moments any feelings that help manifest their feelings they hold on to
05/07/2019, 07:40 - Vidit Avasthi: So if she's bored of something, she'll keep telling herself how it's not right
05/07/2019, 07:41 - Vidit Avasthi: And if you beg her into trying again, she'll spend the next few weeks feeling trapped and you'll be fighting again when you return
05/07/2019, 07:41 - Vidit Avasthi: Take this time off for now
05/07/2019, 07:41 - Vidit Avasthi: All break ups are just a break in the start nothing is certain
05/07/2019, 07:41 - Vidit Avasthi: The events that lead it help decide it's permanence
05/07/2019, 07:42 - Vidit Avasthi: If anything, be glad it's happened at the end of summer when she doesn't have enough time to manifest her thoughts
05/07/2019, 07:42 - Vidit Avasthi: Ek text pe 3 saal ka relationship nahi khatam hota
05/07/2019, 07:42 - Vidit Avasthi: Even Lubaba and I talked for a year after breaking up and we had enough chances to fix everything
05/07/2019, 07:43 - Vidit Avasthi: Tera bhi time aayega but it's not today
05/07/2019, 07:44 - Vidit Avasthi: When I broke up w Madhurima last sem
I was not serious about it
Then her begging really put me off and I had the entire summer to convince myself that I was right from the start
05/07/2019, 07:45 - Vidit Avasthi: She could have changed that but she helped aggravate whatever I thought right from the start
05/07/2019, 07:56 - Jenit Jain: Makes sense
05/07/2019, 07:56 - Jenit Jain: Thank you
05/07/2019, 07:57 - Vidit Avasthi: Impulse mei kuch mat karna because you will spend your final year cursing yourself if you know ki tune khud se kaata
05/07/2019, 07:57 - Jenit Jain: Yep treading carefully
05/07/2019, 07:58 - Vidit Avasthi: Sahi
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Vidit Avasthi: And galti se bhi gaali mat dena
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Jenit Jain: Obviously
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Vidit Avasthi: Talk to her like Mahima talks to everyone
Be sweet even when it's uncalled for, smart people see through it, not so smart people bend over backwards
05/07/2019, 08:01 - Vidit Avasthi: And don't gain weight
05/07/2019, 08:01 - Vidit Avasthi: Breaks your case when the time comes
05/07/2019, 08:01 - Jenit Jain: ?
05/07/2019, 08:02 - Vidit Avasthi: Abey mera bohot make up hote hote kata because I had gained weight by then :p
05/07/2019, 08:02 - Vidit Avasthi: Remember they will want to hold on to anything negative they can find
05/07/2019, 08:02 - Vidit Avasthi: First negatives are the things they can physically see
05/07/2019, 08:03 - Vidit Avasthi: Regardless of how stupid the thing would be
05/07/2019, 08:03 - Jenit Jain: Cool
05/07/2019, 08:05 - Vidit Avasthi: Agle poore hafte mast vodka peeke teri yaad mei BT legi
05/07/2019, 08:05 - Vidit Avasthi: Usko BT hone de
05/07/2019, 08:05 - Jenit Jain: I fucking hope so
05/07/2019, 08:06 - Vidit Avasthi: Hanuman chalisa seekh iss time pe
05/07/2019, 08:07 - Vidit Avasthi: Bhagwaan ka bulawa aane ke alag alag tareeke hote hain
05/07/2019, 08:07 - Jenit Jain: Actually thought about this
05/07/2019, 08:07 - Vidit Avasthi: Bhagwan made you think about it
05/07/2019, 08:07 - Vidit Avasthi: Don't ignore it
05/07/2019, 08:08 - Vidit Avasthi: Pooja paath karne lag
05/07/2019, 08:09 - Vidit Avasthi: Also don't tell anyone about your break up yet
05/07/2019, 08:09 - Jenit Jain: Ik
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Vidit Avasthi: No science behind it but mera maanna hai hai ki honi se pehle dhindora peet ke bhi bad-dua lagti hai
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Jenit Jain: She's like I don't feel the same way for you as you do for me
05/07/2019, 08:11 - Jenit Jain: [7/5, 8:10 AM] Dikshu Pikshu: I don't love you like you love me
[7/5, 8:10 AM] Dikshu Pikshu: I haven't for a long time
05/07/2019, 08:11 - Vidit Avasthi: Bhai bolne de
05/07/2019, 08:11 - Vidit Avasthi: This is pure routine fatigue
05/07/2019, 08:11 - Vidit Avasthi: When you think you want something else and not being able to try aggravates your feelings
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Jenit Jain: But her being able to say this bluntly is a big thing
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Vidit Avasthi: MAYBE it will become permanent over time, if she starts feeling liberated in the next few days
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Vidit Avasthi: This is why I said kuch bhi ho gaali mat dena and be gentle
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Vidit Avasthi: Because bohot trigger hota hai ye time pe
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Vidit Avasthi: When you want to say shit back
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Vidit Avasthi: But that's as far from helping yourself as it can be
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Vidit Avasthi: Jo bol rahi hai take it w incredible grace
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Vidit Avasthi: Make her see a side of you she didn't know existed
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Vidit Avasthi: Even if it is fake :p
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Vidit Avasthi: They are not as strong as they think and we are not as weak as we thing, the one who plays their cards with a stable frame of mind will be the one to win
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Vidit Avasthi: Star mark karde

22/10/2019, 16:22 - Jenit Jain: At shringis?
23/10/2019, 07:57 - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/Madam,

My name is Jenit Jain, a final year student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, Karnataka, India. I'm currently pursuing a major in Computer Science and Engineering.

I have been exploring the field of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning since my first year of engineering. I have past experience of understanding and working with LSTM and CNN models. At my first internship, I was responsible for setting up the entire ML division at a startup from the ground up. I was responsible for creating CNN models to analyse images that clients upload to the company website and give back critical information to the clients. I was also responsible for extracting critical metrics from past data to come up with energy efficient solutions for their devices installed at the client sites. My following internship was at a large private company, where, I worked on a project that is an ongoing collaboration between the company and the government to implement the concept of Smart City.

I have also worked on numerous datasets found on Kaggle to develop my visualization skills and get hands-on experience with libraries like Numpy, SciPy, Pandas and Matplotlib to name a few. This has also helped me gain experience in many different types of data preprocessing techniques. 

My electives include Applied Linear Algebra. Moreover, I'm currently working towards a minor in Intelligent Systems which has helped me gain knowledge in the fields of AI, ML and NLP. 
 
I would love to be considered for the position of Maine Learning Engineer during my final semester of engineering from January 2020 - May 2020.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Jenit Jain.

14/12/2019, 17:23 - Jenit Jain: Accha sun. I knew you were never going to take money. Isliye chup chap split se nikala tha to avoid confusion. Literally sirf tu paise ki baat karta hai hum Mai se. Mai directly bola "so that you don't talk about this in the future" literally my first statement, because we know teko sunane Mai maza aata hai. You clearly proved me right there. Second, I remember breaking one bowl and probably one glass mug. I can assure you that part. Uske alava Puri cutlery ya toh arav toda hai ya cleaner theek hai. Yes the burning thing was a purpose thing but I stopped when you said enough and clearly the tracks had no marks then. Aur bhosdike aisi masti tu bhi karta hai, sab karte hai. And sab rukh jate hai when the other person gets pissed off and that been going on since 1st sem. I can apologise for the clumsy part but even you know I never mean it so I know for a fact you're okay with it and take it as collateral for our friendship. Itna koi Tera nuksaan nahi hogaya. Bhosdike tu plates ginayega 4 saal baad? Dekh teko sunane ke liye sunane hai, ss Lena hai to prove oh you were right once again toh karle. Waise toh tu bhi kabhi change nahi hoga. Mere saath Khali Khali bakchodi maat Kar din ke beech just because you want something to do. Even I'm that bored. Teko kabhi ginaya Kya Tere par kitna kharcha mene aur mere parents ne? Nahi na. But it's fine. Suna de aur. Ss bhej de group par. And deposit se jitna katna hai batade, I'll gladly pay for the fuck ups I've done. But maybe uske baad bhi sunana padega. Par theek hai, Teri aadato ko janta hu and accept karta hu. Lele maze.

26/12/2019, 18:07 - Jenit Jain: I thought you were joking
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Jenit Jain: Punchline ka wait Kar raha tha
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Jenit Jain: But what exactly
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Vidit Avasthi: And will only incorporate once capital valuation reaches $40000
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Jenit Jain: Currency exchange thing?
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Vidit Avasthi: Forex upto $40000
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Jenit Jain: Incorporate what?
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Vidit Avasthi: Then incorporate into investment sector in Africa
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Vidit Avasthi: Potentially looking at Rwanda
26/12/2019, 18:08 - Vidit Avasthi: Will have to shift there after college too
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Jenit Jain: Oh man
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Vidit Avasthi: Remember the billionaire who came over for dinner a few days ago that I snapped?
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Jenit Jain: Ha
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Vidit Avasthi: Owns Yum brands Africa franchisee
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Vidit Avasthi: He's guiding me in the African space because I told him I don't need his capital
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Vidit Avasthi: But I know he'll invest on his own otherwise it isn't worth his time
26/12/2019, 18:09 - Jenit Jain: Ego pe liya hoga lol
26/12/2019, 18:10 - Jenit Jain: But what exactly you doing
26/12/2019, 18:10 - Vidit Avasthi: Have to decide on first investment
26/12/2019, 18:10 - Vidit Avasthi: Still looking at options
26/12/2019, 18:10 - Vidit Avasthi: In Rwanda, they have 100% export of coffee
26/12/2019, 18:10 - Vidit Avasthi: No local demand
26/12/2019, 18:10 - Vidit Avasthi: And very pro-FDI policies
26/12/2019, 18:11 - Vidit Avasthi: So we're looking at selling bulk to hotel chains
26/12/2019, 18:11 - Vidit Avasthi: For the first investment, then we'll see how that goes
26/12/2019, 18:11 - Vidit Avasthi: Naveed is leaning towards importing in Africa which is quicker money but also heavily regulated
26/12/2019, 18:11 - Vidit Avasthi: So we're exploring both options
26/12/2019, 18:12 - Jenit Jain: In India?
26/12/2019, 18:12 - Jenit Jain: And initial money kaha se?
26/12/2019, 18:12 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm only interested in one business in India atm
26/12/2019, 18:12 - Vidit Avasthi: And that's import, sales and servicing of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure
26/12/2019, 18:13 - Vidit Avasthi: And that industry is still 3-4 years away
26/12/2019, 18:13 - Vidit Avasthi: So not thinking about that right now
26/12/2019, 18:13 - Vidit Avasthi: Mutual funds liquidate karke
26/12/2019, 18:13 - Vidit Avasthi: 32 lakh mere paas hai, Naveed has 25 lakhs
26/12/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: But maybe better start now so you'll have an edge later and can afford to fuck up now when the Industry isn't booming
26/12/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: But yeah no money making anytime soon then
26/12/2019, 18:14 - Vidit Avasthi: Just that he's lazy so he doesn't study as seriously as I do
26/12/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: Oh shittt
26/12/2019, 18:14 - Vidit Avasthi: No, there's no market there now
26/12/2019, 18:15 - Jenit Jain: Talent catches up to the laziness eventually toh chill hai
26/12/2019, 18:15 - Vidit Avasthi: You need to step in right when the govt mandates that manufacturers start selling a small portion of inventory as EVs
26/12/2019, 18:15 - Vidit Avasthi: And that legislature is a few years away
26/12/2019, 18:15 - Jenit Jain: Oh
26/12/2019, 18:15 - Vidit Avasthi: Canada will adopt it in next 3 years
26/12/2019, 18:15 - Vidit Avasthi: India will take at least twice as long
26/12/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: Toh tab Tak you wanna import something that you can capitalise in the near future na (coffee)
26/12/2019, 18:16 - Vidit Avasthi: Small value goods with low insurance rates and high yield
26/12/2019, 18:16 - Vidit Avasthi: So coffee
26/12/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: Love that I understand this
26/12/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: Nice man
26/12/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: Kabse baat chal rahi hai?
26/12/2019, 18:17 - Vidit Avasthi: If you can come up with a way to bring property on the internet in Rwanda then boy do I have a market for you
26/12/2019, 18:17 - Vidit Avasthi: Few months
26/12/2019, 18:17 - Vidit Avasthi: This is what I'd like to do but don't have the technical know-how
26/12/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Property in the internet
26/12/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Matlab?
26/12/2019, 18:18 - Vidit Avasthi: Buy, lease, sell
26/12/2019, 18:18 - Vidit Avasthi: Property
26/12/2019, 18:18 - Vidit Avasthi: Put it on the internet
26/12/2019, 18:18 - Vidit Avasthi: Usse bhi zyaada bada market is for Jeet's dad
26/12/2019, 18:18 - Vidit Avasthi: Which I will eventually consider
26/12/2019, 18:18 - Vidit Avasthi: The fastest growing economy in Africa also needs new housing
26/12/2019, 18:19 - Vidit Avasthi: I want Jeet to get into his dad's business once and then I'm gonna pull him in
26/12/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: isnt uganda faster
26/12/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: bc zambia bhi legalise karliya weed for economy
26/12/2019, 18:19 - Vidit Avasthi: No one is as politically stable or focused on growth as Rwanda
26/12/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: udhar karna chaiye apanko kuch
26/12/2019, 18:19 - Vidit Avasthi: Not even Tanzania or South Africa
26/12/2019, 18:20 - Jenit Jain: ha those factors matter
26/12/2019, 18:20 - Vidit Avasthi: Today to make money, you'll have to go where no one wants to go because everywhere else is saturated
26/12/2019, 18:20 - Vidit Avasthi: That's why I was telling you, the more you think about your obligations, the slower you'll grow
26/12/2019, 18:20 - Vidit Avasthi: Go out there and do anything necessary
26/12/2019, 18:21 - Jenit Jain: woh toh hai
26/12/2019, 18:21 - Vidit Avasthi: We're considering North Africa, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait at the moment
26/12/2019, 18:21 - Jenit Jain: for import?
26/12/2019, 18:21 - Vidit Avasthi: Saudi in general has too much to offer
26/12/2019, 18:21 - Vidit Avasthi: In Saudi and Kuwait both I'm interested in EV import and servicing
26/12/2019, 18:21 - Vidit Avasthi: Along with hopefully have a monopoly on charging
26/12/2019, 18:22 - Vidit Avasthi: Saudi also has an upcoming tourism industry
26/12/2019, 18:22 - Vidit Avasthi: But yes
26/12/2019, 18:22 - Vidit Avasthi: Next year at this time we may very well be living in Rwanda
26/12/2019, 18:22 - Vidit Avasthi: Or planning the move
26/12/2019, 18:23 - Jenit Jain: charging what?
26/12/2019, 18:23 - Vidit Avasthi: The cars x_x
26/12/2019, 18:23 - Jenit Jain: Bro best case scenario bc kaun jata hai udhar. Udhar jakar yeh sab kiya toh nothing like it
26/12/2019, 18:24 - Vidit Avasthi: That's the point
26/12/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: Only charging mai bhi monopoly hai :/
26/12/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: exactly
26/12/2019, 18:26 - Vidit Avasthi: <Media omitted>
26/12/2019, 18:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Not many Asian nations can either
26/12/2019, 18:26 - Vidit Avasthi: Every year Rwanda grows twice as fast as the biggest economies in Africa
26/12/2019, 18:28 - Vidit Avasthi: That's why it matters to have worldly knowledge, so you can identify opportunities
26/12/2019, 18:28 - Vidit Avasthi: Tell anyone you're going to Rwanda odds are they've either never heard of it or they'll tell you you're stupid bc kaun jaata hai
26/12/2019, 18:29 - Vidit Avasthi: Abhi kaam karo sab log 1-2 saal
26/12/2019, 18:29 - Vidit Avasthi: Kuch saal mei I'll figure a way out to bring everyone together
26/12/2019, 18:31 - Vidit Avasthi: Frankly if the situation in Hong Kong sees rapid deterioration over the next few years, then that in itself will be an opportunity for my business
26/12/2019, 18:31 - Jenit Jain: the latter for sure
26/12/2019, 18:32 - Jenit Jain: sab itna sasta ho jayega
26/12/2019, 18:32 - Jenit Jain: desh chud toh gaya hai kafi

26/12/2019, 18:36 - Vidit Avasthi: Is ability to work on the ground
26/12/2019, 18:36 - Jenit Jain: koi nahi kar sakta bc
26/12/2019, 18:37 - Vidit Avasthi: Kaustubh jaayega khet mei farmer se ladne ki yield kyun nahi aa raha
26/12/2019, 18:37 - Vidit Avasthi: I won't do that
26/12/2019, 18:37 - Jenit Jain: yeh slavery wapas layege business ke liye africa mai 😂
26/12/2019, 18:38 - Vidit Avasthi: Anyway
26/12/2019, 18:38 - Vidit Avasthi: These plans will take years to materialise
26/12/2019, 18:38 - Vidit Avasthi: But yes there is real potential provided everyone does their bit
26/12/2019, 18:39 - Jenit Jain: when are you planning to initiate anything but
26/12/2019, 18:39 - Vidit Avasthi: January end
26/12/2019, 18:39 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm making Naveed study right now
26/12/2019, 18:39 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm trying to arrange $1700 cash bc I don't want to sell shares rn
26/12/2019, 18:39 - Vidit Avasthi: Naveed already has his $1700
26/12/2019, 18:40 - Jenit Jain: nahi but first kaha se chalu karega?

26/12/2019, 18:40 - Vidit Avasthi: Min of 1000 dollars each
26/12/2019, 18:40 - Vidit Avasthi: Then trade forex till we have 40k
26/12/2019, 18:41 - Jenit Jain: 3400 to 40K mai kafi time chalejayega
26/12/2019, 18:41 - Vidit Avasthi: I want to have $20000 combined between us when Brexit finally takes shape
26/12/2019, 18:41 - Vidit Avasthi: That's my first opportunity
26/12/2019, 18:41 - Jenit Jain: 😂
26/12/2019, 18:41 - Jenit Jain: uski date postpone hoti rehgi
26/12/2019, 18:42 - Vidit Avasthi: On that day pound will drop and I will buy one ton of Indian rupees
26/12/2019, 18:44 - Vidit Avasthi: Not to mention that both jeet and Kaustubh's dad are in construction
26/12/2019, 18:44 - Vidit Avasthi: So if jeet licenses his name to Kaustubh
26/12/2019, 18:44 - Vidit Avasthi: Kaustubh can take loans under his dad's company for construction projects in Rwanda on Jeet's companies name
26/12/2019, 18:45 - Vidit Avasthi: Jeet will get licensing fees and Kaustubh will get to legitimately grow his dad's business
26/12/2019, 18:46 - Vidit Avasthi: Not to mention you can import cheap textile from Africa
26/12/2019, 18:47 - Vidit Avasthi: All of us have a lot to offer that we haven't even realised
26/12/2019, 18:47 - Vidit Avasthi: I'm going to tap into all of that
26/12/2019, 18:47 - Jenit Jain: Bro fuck tab khudke Paisa hoga remind me
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Won't make sense
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Textiles are down in Asia
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Already over production hai
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Vidit Avasthi: Lol then we won't do that
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: But yeah
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Vidit Avasthi: For me
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Vidit Avasthi: I see more point growing in Africa with Africa
26/12/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Sirf padhna padega sab mucj
26/12/2019, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: Rather than the usual foreigner approach to taking resources
26/12/2019, 18:49 - Jenit Jain: Lol so true
26/12/2019, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: That's why housing development is important to me
26/12/2019, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: Because you prove the concept in one broke country
26/12/2019, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: And all the other broke countries will beg you to do it for them
26/12/2019, 18:49 - Vidit Avasthi: Which leads to all kinds of subsidies, tax exemptions and amazing loans
26/12/2019, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: Bhai kaustubh ka karana hai somehow ek din
26/12/2019, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: Itna potential hai
26/12/2019, 18:51 - Jenit Jain: Phir bhi 3k pm ke tuitions de raha hai
26/12/2019, 18:51 - Jenit Jain: Like fine good enough for now. But clearly not remotely good enough for bim
26/12/2019, 18:56 - Vidit Avasthi: With his degree
26/12/2019, 18:56 - Vidit Avasthi: His life may actually remain in mediocrity unless he does something substantial with conviction
26/12/2019, 18:56 - Vidit Avasthi: And woh job mei nahi hoga
26/12/2019, 18:57 - Vidit Avasthi: Usko business karna hoga
26/12/2019, 18:57 - Vidit Avasthi: Mujhe bhi
26/12/2019, 18:57 - Jenit Jain: Exactly
