5/13/20, 11:05 AM - Daniel Sir Hod: Dear class counsellors 

I strongly believe that class counsellors are bridging the students of our institution with the administration.

There is an absolute uniqueness in the responsibilities held by any class counsellors as they are the first point of contact for any student.

I appreciate all class counsellors of our campus for doing wonders in the past. 

Now I look forward to them in this unprecedented time of COVID 19 to keep the students of our campus informed about our admission activities and promote the virtues of NCR campus.
Students who are presently persuing their studies with NCR campus are our ambassadors whose word of mouth can work wonders for us in terms of admissions.

Also it is advised to bring the concerns of the students to our knowledge on day to day basis.

It is my appeal to all class counsellors that they keep close touch with their students and cascade them with information regarding admissions 2020. Through this we can expect that more number of candidates will opt for our campus when they get positive feedback from students already studying here.
