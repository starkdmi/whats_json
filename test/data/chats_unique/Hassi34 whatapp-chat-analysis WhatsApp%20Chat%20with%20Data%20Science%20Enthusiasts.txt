I am in need of career guidance. I hope experts here could guide me.

I have begun my career 1.5 years back in an auto industry in a managerial role. I would like to switch my career towards data science since my interests are towards mathematics and business which my current role doesn't satisfy. 

So, what should I do to change my role towards data science? I am doing online courses in data science. In addition to that, what can I do? And how should I apply for jobs?

4/27/20, 11:53 AM - DS. Amayo. Africa: I think that the best way to learn datascience is by practicing every learned skills on real life datasets as this will allow you to gauge how well you have learnt a skills and what your knowledge gaps are.

So I tried out some of the things that I have been learning on a dataset that seeks to predict the risk of developing heart disease and here is my notebook:

https://www.kaggle.com/amayomordecai/heart-disease-risk-prediction-machine-learning

What I found out was that simple techniques such as feature selection and dataset balancing can go a long way in improving a model.
4/27/20, 11:53 AM - DS. Amayo. Africa: I also think that kaggle is the best place for anyone to practice their skills.

5/2/20, 9:49 PM - +54 9 11 6836-4801: Anyone can recomend me a good book data science related from this list?
5/2/20, 10:04 PM - +1 (437) 225-4040: Guys .. I have question.. how good is R for data science . Or  Python is must .
5/2/20, 10:12 PM - +91 82335 73373: Python is a multi use language, pretty good for data science because of the various libraries, and a large community 
R is more a statistical tool , more used by researchers
5/2/20, 10:13 PM - +91 82335 73373: R is better in terms of mathematics, but python is more user friendly for Data science
5/2/20, 10:13 PM - +1 (437) 225-4040: Ok ... They doing Machine  learning in R as well ?!
5/2/20, 10:17 PM - +1 (437) 225-4040: I mean I have started this data science course from John Hopkins .. and they are using R . But I am confused .. cause every one else is using Python .. even colleges with data analytics course are mostly using Python .
5/2/20, 10:37 PM - +91 82335 73373: Yes, u can do ML in R
5/2/20, 10:37 PM - +91 82335 73373: I would suggest to go for a Python based course

5/2/20, 11:08 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: If I may chip in. I think that you would be better placed if you learn both languages.

Technologies change very fast and the more you know the better.
5/2/20, 11:08 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: That being said... I would go for python any day any time üòÖ
5/2/20, 11:26 PM - +91 82335 73373: Thats true

5/2/20, 11:30 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: Julia is ~good~. Python is slow and Julia is meant to be the cure. But let's face it computers are becoming faster and banking on a language just because it has a slightly better performance is not wise.

But it does not hurt to know it
5/2/20, 11:31 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: Anyway, I choose python üòÖüòÖüòÖ... and then R is a close second

https://ineuron1.viewpage.co/ArchitectureDesignResumeBuilding

Today we are going to launch one more ‚Äògiving back to the community‚Äô initiative. So far, in our experience while providing training for data science and while interviewing candidates, we have observed that one of  the things which is most lacking is the intuition and experience to build an end to end machine learning pipeline and architecture.
Hence, we are launching this initiative to discuss various architectures catering to almost all the software industry domains. Here, we will drill down to the nitty-gritty of building a software solution from scratch and discuss various ways to make it scalable and robust. Moreover, we‚Äôll also talk about building your resumes for data science job roles based on your experience and the industry domain that you work in

5/20/20, 11:16 AM - DS. Amayo. Africa: You can just do a:
pip install tensorflow

and

pip install keras

And it should work
5/20/20, 11:16 AM - DS. Amayo. Africa: It depends if your computer has a GPU
5/20/20, 11:17 AM - DS. Amayo. Africa: But incase it has one, like the Nvidia GPU's, then you can read the following article to see how you can configure your computer:

6/5/20, 7:47 PM - +91 82335 73373: I am looking for opportunities,  I guess most of us are
6/5/20, 7:48 PM - +91 90299 89325: Why I'm asking is what is required for a fresher to be employable in a data science position
6/5/20, 7:49 PM - +91 82335 73373: It greatly depends on your background,  if you are a cs graduate things are different 
Else its a bit difficult to say the least
6/5/20, 7:49 PM - +91 82335 73373: Basically data science problems are turning into more of a software problem
6/5/20, 7:50 PM - +91 90299 89325: Okay

6/5/20, 7:52 PM - +91 90299 89325: Also regarding Deep learning is it necessary for data science. I might be wrong but I've heard that Deep Learning is being used for very small proportion of Data science Applications.
6/5/20, 7:59 PM - +91 90299 89325: Any suggestions?
6/5/20, 8:08 PM - +91 82335 73373: Deep learning is not necessary,  however most of the fancy applications like working with images , text , or audio
6/5/20, 8:08 PM - +91 82335 73373: need knowledge of DL
6/5/20, 8:12 PM - +91 90299 89325: Okay

6/16/20, 2:35 AM - +234 808 325 6441: I really can‚Äôt remember but I think they do
6/16/20, 2:35 AM - +234 808 325 6441: 20-30k yearly or so
6/16/20, 8:08 AM - +91 95092 49507: UC's will be a good option for you too
6/16/20, 8:09 AM - +91 95092 49507: Less competitive, as MIT is the best so competition is throat to throat.
6/16/20, 8:10 AM - +91 95092 49507: And PhD are almost free in most of the universities or atleast you can make them free by working with professors and by taking other campus job opportunities.
6/16/20, 8:11 AM - +91 95092 49507: By the way PhD is basically you working for university in the field of reserch so they provide you with stipend.
6/16/20, 8:11 AM - +91 95092 49507: But I guess you have a bachelors degree , right ? If so then you have to enroll in some masters and PhD integrated program , I guess Berkeley has one. It's pretty good.

6/16/20, 2:35 PM - +91 80555 23200: In my view If you're looking for job in the end.. its better you do Masters... Its only 1 or 2 years while pHD can take 4-5 years.
6/16/20, 2:36 PM - +91 95092 49507: So true
6/16/20, 2:36 PM - +91 80555 23200: And you have placement assistance for masters
6/16/20, 2:36 PM - +91 95092 49507: If you want to do research at the end then PhD is the best way to do so
6/16/20, 2:36 PM - +91 95092 49507: But if you want to work in the industry then work experience is always better than PhD
6/16/20, 2:37 PM - +91 90226 91004: Any low cost masters in this field
6/16/20, 2:37 PM - +91 95092 49507: I read a lot of answers over quora about it and most of the people had this POV

6/24/20, 8:53 PM - +91 90961 25202: Please can anyone help me with this
6/24/20, 8:57 PM - +91 75066 45805: What are you not understanding ?
6/24/20, 9:02 PM - +91 75066 45805: As far as I can see, you have to initialise the loop with 1042000, use log to know how many digits there are, and then cube the digits by dividing by 10 I think and check whether it is equal to the initial number. Exit if so
6/24/20, 9:02 PM - +91 95669 34620: But it's not Armstrong number
6/24/20, 9:03 PM - +91 75066 45805: It's a loop
6/24/20, 9:03 PM - +91 95669 34620: It's not cube it's power the no.of. digits
6/24/20, 9:03 PM - +91 75066 45805: ?
6/24/20, 9:03 PM - +91 95669 34620: For eg.
12 means 1power2 + 2power2
6/24/20, 9:03 PM - +91 75066 45805: For an Armstrong number you have to use power3
6/24/20, 9:04 PM - +91 95669 34620: 123 means 1power3 + 2power3 + 3power3
6/24/20, 9:04 PM - +91 95669 34620: No it's not power 3 it's power no.of.digits..!!

6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 95669 34620: You are saying this bcoz you have been taught only for finding a three digit Armstrong number
6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 75066 45805: Okay fine
6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 75066 45805: The theory is still sound
6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 95669 34620: Just google it for confirmation !!
6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 75066 45805: This but you use the digit to choose the power
6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 95669 34620: This is the theory
6/24/20, 9:05 PM - +91 95669 34620: Yes, for this it is power7
6/24/20, 9:06 PM - +91 75066 45805: I'm not a number theorist
6/24/20, 9:06 PM - +91 75066 45805: They asked about a loop I told them how to do the loop
6/24/20, 9:06 PM - +91 75066 45805: Presumably they can Google and figure out what an Armstrong number is
6/24/20, 9:08 PM - +91 90961 25202: Ok i have got the solution

6/27/20, 7:27 PM - +94 71 968 8884: Ah then copy anaconda terminal
6/27/20, 7:27 PM - +94 71 968 8884: I am using it that way
6/27/20, 7:28 PM - +91 99404 72007: didnt get

6/27/20, 7:38 PM - +91 98673 06334: i dont know much about anaconda
6/27/20, 7:38 PM - +91 99404 72007: hi let me know if it worked for anyone shown in the video
6/27/20, 7:38 PM - +91 99404 72007: ok
6/27/20, 7:39 PM - +91 98673 06334: Is this not working ?
6/27/20, 7:40 PM - +91 99404 72007: i want to open jupyter notebook, not cmd prompt
6/27/20, 7:41 PM - +91 98673 06334: In cmd type jupyter notebook
6/27/20, 7:41 PM - +91 98673 06334: .
6/27/20, 7:42 PM - +91 99404 72007: it will work if u install jupyter notebook directly not from anaconda
6/27/20, 7:43 PM - +91 99404 72007: i am using anaconda jupyter notebook
6/27/20, 7:43 PM - +91 98673 06334: i had once installed it from anaconda and this trick worked
6/27/20, 7:45 PM - +91 99404 72007: guide me if u can recall

6/27/20, 7:55 PM - +91 95669 34620: First add it environment variable then problem clears
6/27/20, 7:56 PM - DS Durgesh: question: 
for example if there is data set which has 4 variables a,b,c,d now if i did some pre processing and created one new variable x and y now i got new data set which has 6 variables a,b,c,d,x,y then i created model and deployed

now i want to do something so that whenever my model gets input it a,b,c,d it should automatically creates derived attributes and then run it on model and get output

how to achieve this is there any technique?

6/28/20, 6:09 PM - +852 6437 0433: But actually is it better to start with learning any programming language first
6/28/20, 6:15 PM - +91 75066 45805: Yes
6/28/20, 6:17 PM - +91 72599 33599: After reading a lot of books...how do we start practicing? Hackathons and kaggle and stuff?
6/28/20, 6:21 PM - +91 95669 34620: Reading only books is not a quite good
Better dive into coding partly ....
6/28/20, 6:29 PM - +91 75066 45805: Don't read a book. Use a practical course so you're doing things
6/28/20, 6:29 PM - +91 75066 45805: Don't only read* I mean
6/28/20, 6:32 PM - +7 916 092-55-75: This particular book allows to start coding also. At least you could copy code from the book. Simultaneously google and try to do other steps 
Absolutely agree, the only reading is a bad idea
6/28/20, 6:33 PM - +91 72599 33599: Hands on ml?
6/28/20, 6:33 PM - +91 75066 45805: Best thing to do is to choose a simple project you want to do, and use the book to figure out how to do it
6/28/20, 6:37 PM - +91 72599 33599: How much do hackathons help?
6/28/20, 6:37 PM - +7 916 092-55-75: I‚Äôm sorry, what exactly do you mean?

6/28/20, 6:39 PM - +7 916 092-55-75: If a person has no coding experience at all, how Kaggle can help him?
6/28/20, 6:40 PM - +91 72599 33599: Kaggle has short courses to get started on coding...and then you can practice using the data sets provided therr
6/28/20, 6:40 PM - +91 72599 33599: There
6/28/20, 6:41 PM - +91 72599 33599: And of course one must use books and courses right?
6/28/20, 6:41 PM - +91 72599 33599: I was just confirming the book
6/28/20, 6:41 PM - +7 916 092-55-75: That‚Äôs great. Actually I didn‚Äôt know 
You could offer this option to Brian. Here everybody is free to do it
6/28/20, 6:42 PM - +7 916 092-55-75: It‚Äôs not obligatory, but a good option for me

6/28/20, 9:37 PM - +91 97008 27581: Which is the best book... For statistics and machine learning?

7/3/20, 3:10 PM - +91 97008 27581: We have different libraries like numpy pandas Matplotlib seaborn etc... Then why we use tableau?
7/3/20, 3:12 PM - +91 93445 36557: Hello ppl
7/3/20, 3:12 PM - +91 93445 36557: I want to start with data science
7/3/20, 3:12 PM - +91 93445 36557: Can anyone guide me
7/3/20, 3:14 PM - +91 80555 23200: https://careers.coursera.org/data-scientist
7/3/20, 3:19 PM - +91 96011 91362: They are data visualization libraries , while tableau is a BI tool which has complete solution for data visualization and business intelligence,we can create BI charts , find relations and create creative dashboards etc.
7/3/20, 3:19 PM - +91 97008 27581: Tnx for the info bro...
7/3/20, 3:20 PM - +91 97008 27581: Apart from BI can we use in data science..?
7/3/20, 3:21 PM - +91 97008 27581: If yes how can we interface...
7/3/20, 3:28 PM - +91 97008 27581: With the machine learning models
7/3/20, 3:34 PM - +91 95669 34620: You do whatever Tableau does with python code
But it's difficult to code
But with Tableau with a single click in charts etc.. we can visualise it.
No coding is needed in Tableau...
7/3/20, 3:35 PM - +91 95669 34620: You can do whatever*
7/3/20, 3:35 PM - +91 80555 23200: Tableau is data visualization software... Some companies prefer this with SQL.
But even in R u can do everything that is done in tableau
7/3/20, 3:36 PM - +91 93445 36557: Will this course be fine?
7/3/20, 3:38 PM - +91 80555 23200: Its not a single course .. its path containing multiple course...
You can choose depending on your interest.
7/3/20, 3:38 PM - +91 93445 36557: Ihh
7/3/20, 3:38 PM - +91 93445 36557: Ohh

7/3/20, 3:40 PM - +91 80555 23200: You can select the topic from the list and do that course on any platform.
For example one topic is data cleaning.
7/3/20, 3:42 PM - +91 80555 23200: First decide your goal.
If your doing it for job or to develop something of your own
If job then which business analytics or data analysis or data scientist

Then you can learn accordingly

3. Nvidia graphics card
4. I5 8th Gen Processor
7/5/20, 8:52 PM - +49 178 5265941: 8 gb ram is not sufficient... It will give u errors in slightly bigger projects....
7/5/20, 9:05 PM - +91 76783 67265: Buy a normal laptop
7/5/20, 9:05 PM - +91 76783 67265: and use cloud platforms for ML

7/6/20, 10:14 AM - +91 75066 45805: How much ram do you think a normal laptop can have? I don't think any of us can afford the ThinkPad with 128gb ram
7/6/20, 10:15 AM - +91 99806 99772: Atleast 16GB
7/6/20, 10:16 AM - +91 75066 45805: Those will start at rs 1 lakh
7/6/20, 10:17 AM - +91 99806 99772: This is suffice just increase the RAM which doesn't cost much
7/6/20, 11:24 AM - +91 80555 23200: Most of the laptop come with 8 gb ram. If you want more you have to buy additional from company store or service center.

16 gb ram laptop will cost around 1lakh
7/6/20, 11:25 AM - +91 75066 45805: ‚òùÔ∏èI know
7/6/20, 11:26 AM - +91 80555 23200: Buy 8gb ram with I5 and graphics card it will be enough for you now
For more saving you can buy ryzon 5 processer
7/6/20, 11:27 AM - +91 80555 23200: If you buy from company store they can give you additional 8 gb ram at minimum cost if you really want more ram
7/6/20, 11:33 AM - +91 95669 34620: This is much more enough !!
After u master deep learning then think of extending the RAM

7/18/20, 11:22 AM - +91 75066 45805: Check individual applications
7/18/20, 11:22 AM - +91 75066 45805: Courses may ask for gate score
7/18/20, 11:24 AM - +91 94307 23304: Gate score in what discipline, that's what I'm asking. Because I've been told that you can give gate for stats but not for data science.
7/18/20, 11:24 AM - +91 75066 45805: Check the courses you want to apply for
7/18/20, 11:24 AM - +91 75066 45805: And then if they don't say anything specific, do some googling or email the admin
7/18/20, 11:27 AM - +234 806 935 1113: I don't think Gate score applies to international students

7/26/20, 9:01 PM - +91 6301 180 430: This is from Dr. Geetha Krishnaswamy, Please give your 2min and read this:-

1. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 7:45pm and you‚Äôre going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.

2. You‚Äôre really tired, upset and frustrated. 

3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.

4. Unfortunately you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll be able to make it that far.

5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy who taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.

6. HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only
about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. 

7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing
repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. 

A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two
seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until
the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

8. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing
movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. 

9. Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!

10. A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail
kindly send it to 10 people, you can bet that we‚Äôll save at least one life.

11. Rather than sending jokes, please..contribute by forwarding this mail which can save a person‚Äôs life‚Ä¶.

12. If this message comes around you ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶more than once‚Ä¶..please don‚Äôt get irritated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶U need to be happy that you have many friends who care about you & being reminded of how to tackle‚Ä¶.Heart attacks‚Ä¶.AGAIN‚Ä¶

From: 
DR.N Siva
(Senior Cardiologist)

U might save lives..üòä

8/22/20, 7:35 PM - +91 81490 89099: First some questions on ML fundamentals:

1st Ques. Could you list some steps for data wrangling and data cleaning before you would apply ?

Ans. While there are numerous steps for data wrangling and data cleaning, the common ones include ‚Äì

Data profiling;
data visualizations;
syntax error;
standardization or normalization;
handling null values
are some of the common steps for data wrangling and data cleaning before we apply ML algorithms.

2nd Ques. List the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning with concrete examples.

Ans. Supervised learning requires training labeled data and involves learning a function, which maps an input to an output based on the sample input-output pairs. Example: If you have a dataset of two variables i.e. age ‚Äì input and height ‚Äì output, then you could implement the supervised learning model and predict the height of a person based on her age.

Unsupervised learning is about drawing inferences and finding patterns from the input data without references to labeled outcomes. Example: Grouping customers according to their buying behavior to identify target markets.

Above-mentioned questions are sample sets. There could be variations to them. So do prepare well and now for some questions based on Statistics, Probability, and mathematics.

3rd Ques. What do you understand by A/B testing?

Ans. A/B testing is essentially a form of hypothesis testing. A two-sample hypothesis testing to compare two versions. A/B testing is usually used to both improve and optimize user experience and marketing.

4th Ques. What is the difference between convex and non-convex cost function? And what do you mean when a cost function is non-convex?

Ans. When a line drawn between any two points on the graph lies either on or above the graph, then it is a convex function. Convex function has one minimum.

On the other hand, when a line drawn between any two points on the graph intersect each other points on the graph. Non-convex is characterized as ‚Äòwavy.‚Äô

A cost function is non-convex when there is a chance that the function might find local minima instead of the global minimum ‚Äì a highly undesired stage in machine learning models from an optimization perspective.

5th Ques. What is the statistical power?

Ans. ‚ÄòStatistical power‚Äô is defined as the power of a binary hypotheses that is the probability, which the test rejects the null hypothesis given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The formula is as given below.

Power = P (reject null\ alternative is true)

9/22/20, 8:08 AM - +91 94264 53838: Start with the courses mentioned in Kaggle?
9/22/20, 11:44 AM - DS Puneet: Yes
9/22/20, 5:13 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: I don't know if it's too late to answer this but this is what I think about the question.


First you are given a dataset that only contains numbers between 0 to 1.0 and each number can be grouped according to the following intervals [0, 0.2), [0.2, 0.4), ... [0.8, 1.0) etc however each group does not have the same number of values and therefore the dataset is imbalanced.

What they want you to do is to create a new dataset (pick up numbers from from the existing dataset) such that each group has an equal amount of numbers
9/22/20, 5:13 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: Let me give you an example to illustrate this.

In the first example your dataset is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9.

If you group the data according to the intervals then:

[0, 0.2) has one value i.e 0.1

[0.2, 0.4) has one value i.e 0.3

[0.4, 0.6) has one value i.e 0.5

[0.6, 0.8) has one value i.e 0.7

[0.8, 1.0) has one value i.e 0.9

So if you were to create a balanced dataset from this data you will pick one value from each group and your final answer will be:

0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9
9/22/20, 5:13 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: In the second example your dataset is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5

If you group the data according to the intervals then:

[0, 0.2) has one value i.e 0.1

[0.2, 0.4) has one value i.e 0.3

[0.4, 0.6) has two values i.e 0.5 and 0.5

[0.6, 0.8) has one value i.e 0.7

[0.8, 1.0) has one value i.e 0.9

You can see that in this dataset one group has 2 values while the rest have one value. So to create a balanced dataset you would only pick one value from each group thus ensuring that your new dataset has the same number of items in each group. 

0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9
9/22/20, 5:13 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: In the third example your dataset is  0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5

If you group the data according to the intervals then:

[0, 0.2) has no value 

[0.2, 0.4) has one value i.e 0.3

[0.4, 0.6) has two values i.e 0.5 and 0.5

[0.6, 0.8) has one value i.e 0.7

[0.8, 1.0) has one value i.e 0.9

In this example one group does not have a value so its impossible to create a balanced dataset from this example in that case your answer will be None
9/22/20, 5:13 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: The procedure should be quite straightforward for the last example.

So in summary you can try this approach.

1. Read the data from stdin.

2. Group the numbers in their various categories/ intervals.

3. Count the number of values in each category

4. If a category has no value then return None

5. Otherwise note the category with the least number of values and then pick a similar number of items from each category.

6. Output your new dataset
9/22/20, 5:19 PM - DS. Amayo. Africa: Here is my own implementation. But it is not the cleanest or the most efficient piece of code. I am sure that it can be improved

9/24/20, 12:42 AM - +91 86683 33293: Apart from what these good men told you .. I'll recommend participating in ML meetup, webinar, and community events. It really helps in a fast gain of knowledge, plus you'll get different people's perspectives about concepts and ideas which may be very very useful later. 

I find it greatly beneficial
9/24/20, 1:08 AM - +91 93443 34569: Definitely but at the same time before going to the workshop or seminar have a basic knowledge of the topic so that you will understand what they are speaking.
9/24/20, 6:28 AM - +91 95092 49507: Can't agree more, due to pandemic lot of seminars are taking place virtually and mostly for free so consider joining them.

11/10/20, 7:59 PM - +49 178 5265941: Exactly
11/10/20, 8:02 PM - +49 178 5265941: I want your opinion guys.

How do you know the training is over fitting. For example and training a model and in just one each pockets giving me 92% accuracy. And after 3 epochs give me 97 accuracy. What should I consider before stopping I know on internet mostly people say loss. I want to hear different opinions
11/10/20, 8:04 PM - +91 95092 49507: +1, I struggle with similar issues.
11/10/20, 8:31 PM - +91 95669 34620: Often when you consider overfitting is,
Your training accuracy is too far from the testing accuracy.
11/10/20, 8:31 PM - +91 95669 34620: Like 
If training accuracy is 97%
If testing accuracy is 82%  then it's overfitting
11/10/20, 8:32 PM - +91 95669 34620: If training accuracy is 97% 
And 
Testing accuracy is 93% 
Then you may say it's a very good model..
11/10/20, 8:33 PM - +91 95669 34620: Clear bro ?
11/10/20, 8:39 PM - +49 178 5265941: Mmm
11/10/20, 8:39 PM - +49 178 5265941: Okay. Do we need testing if we have validation data
11/10/20, 8:39 PM - +49 178 5265941: If training is 97, validation is 95
11/10/20, 8:40 PM - +49 178 5265941: I mean in validation we dont train. We just cross check with new data. If we're not changing the hyperparameter and it's just a test dataset. 
Then we don't need to test again and am I correct ?
11/10/20, 8:47 PM - +91 95669 34620: Yeah
11/10/20, 8:48 PM - +91 95669 34620: Good

11/10/20, 9:00 PM - +91 90299 89325: These guys just feed on the fear of beginners
11/10/20, 9:01 PM - +91 90299 89325: Guys, if you have free resources or you have a good grasp of concepts and want to train/mentor someone, please go ahead. Share your contact details and ask students to contact you.
11/10/20, 9:01 PM - +91 90299 89325: Please don't do this. It's a request
11/10/20, 9:02 PM - +91 94264 53838: Yeah that would be really good for beginners like me. If someone is looking to mentor or share their knowledge it would be really helpful.
11/10/20, 9:28 PM - +91 99033 54422: According to me,the validation data is seen by the model repetitively when you are running the model for multiple epochs,its training on training data,testing during training using validation data.But the test data is seen only once after you complete the entire training.So test data error is called "generalization error",how well your model is responding to brand new data.
11/10/20, 9:28 PM - +91 99033 54422: Its my understanding,i may be wrong as well.
11/10/20, 9:29 PM - +49 178 5265941: I think it makes sense

11/11/20, 7:56 PM - +91 95092 49507: Kind of yes.
11/11/20, 8:23 PM - +49 178 5265941: Yes. Just type data wrangling steps on google. There are many good blogs. Its kinda template. With experience u will get it. Many things are same. Sometimes tho it depends on dataset what u dont want to clean.
11/11/20, 8:44 PM - +1 (773) 999-6068: I am a beginner too and kinda scared! anybody willing to guide or mentor.. it will be really helpful üôè
11/11/20, 9:13 PM - +1 (647) 746-7134: Thanks Sunny for the reply.. I have searched the steps of data wrangling but I found that every data scientist has his own way of wrangling.. so that's why I wanted to know what are you guys doing in this step..
11/11/20, 10:34 PM - +49 178 5265941: This message was deleted
11/11/20, 10:36 PM - +49 178 5265941: Yes because wrangling depends upon what do you want to clean. It depends , what do you want from your dataset.
For example if one of your column is URL, then you cannot remove everything except the characters and numbers (like normally people do) .you have to save these things also. It totally depends upon the the dataset. Normally there are basic regex things that everyone use.just check out 3-4 blogs and take out the common things practice that and then see what you want from your dataset and use accordingly

11/11/20, 10:38 PM - +49 178 5265941: You don't need to get scared the data scientist community is very big.nowadays there are hundreds and hundreds of tutorial on YouTube. So many helpful blogs. Just start from the basic and practice and as you go along you will understand more and more things. Follow a YouTuber, practice all his/her tutorials. Once you finish with that you will have many doubts and but better. understanding. And then check out other YouTubers and blogs and clear your doubts

11/12/20, 8:33 PM - +91 94264 53838: Like I try to follow youtubers but problem is everyone have their own perspective and there are many things which you would realize they didn't cover and that only happens if you watch other youtuber.
11/12/20, 8:33 PM - +91 94264 53838: It's like tutorial hell. One after other and you don't know when to stop.
11/12/20, 8:34 PM - +91 94264 53838: So I feel like it's better to take guidance from someone who actually has experience in the field or self taught them cause they can save a lot of time plus you learn other things from their experiences.
11/12/20, 8:35 PM - +1 (773) 999-6068: Agreed, I felt the same
11/12/20, 8:36 PM - +91 94264 53838: Yes..so as of now how you are trying to learn?
11/12/20, 8:59 PM - +49 178 5265941: Mmm i have different opinion. I started learning data Science just one year ago. And I'm really happy where I am now and I just learnt from YouTube. Of course there are tons of things that I still need to know and everyday new. Things to come.

But the key is still know what you want to do and what you want to become.
Within data Science there are many branches.
So first understand what data Science is. Then according to in your interests search more about that field. Then search what all technologies and things are needed in that field.

This will narrow down your search quite a bit.
In general find a tutorial for python complete package.
Then learn machine learning
then depending upon for the your interests go deep learning etc etc

Of course having a mentor will help. But if you could find a mentor then you wouldn't be here.

I stopped looking for someone's help and try to learn by making mistakes and googling it again again.
Its tedious. But it works or

Simple solution. Go join a payed course . There are many good ones too.

12/6/20, 6:22 PM - +49 178 5265941: Hey guys I I have a question. How do you deal with the URLs as an input feature. It is an important feature and I cannot just exclude.  Do I just include the base you are as one of the feature. And of all you are will be treated as a single string . On Internet there is an much Discussion. Mostly other people just ignore the Urls or there Specific situations where the extract the feature just from the URLs But that‚Äôs just for the website classification or something. But in my case I want to use it as a feature along with like body and the other features.
12/6/20, 6:27 PM - +91 95669 34620: Maybe you can consider only the hostname from the url.
But it won't be distinct.
You should use some sort NLP and substitute the URL with a collective word and use for classification or prediction.
12/6/20, 8:55 PM - +49 178 5265941: At the moment I am using a base URL. they don‚Äôt need to be distict. It‚Äôs just a value .  And after that I‚Äôm concatenating it to go other fields . I don‚Äôt know if this approach is good or not. 
So was just wondering if anyone else has used URL  as one of the feature in the machine learning projects

12/9/20, 8:01 PM - +49 178 5265941: Please guys stop promoting things here. Nobody is looking for a job here people are here to discuss about the things related to data science. And this is an international group. I‚Äôm sorry to say but mostly from one particular country people are spamming with jobs and internships. See you do it by yourself
12/9/20, 8:02 PM - +49 178 5265941: Otherwise this will just become a spam box like our inbox and Gmail With job postings
12/9/20, 9:25 PM - +91 81490 89099: Never Intended in that way...just wanted to update guys here about job and skills required for future job for what they are here and learning day and night...

Just posted to help the needy who are having skills and looking for change...

Just wanted to help people in the pandemic..

Never meant to spam this group with irrelevant stuff...

Hope u understand and appreciate...

Thanks..

12/14/20, 9:12 PM - +52 444 323 2525: Hi everybody,
my name is Fernando, kind regards from M√©xico. 
This year I decided to study computer science. This far, it has been difficult because of how complex it is; I realized how big the field is: at first I was asked_ what do yo want to program?_
I can't tell for sure, but I'm enjoying how close is programming with Math and I'm liking statistics (Math applied) and programming.
I hope I can learn R and Matlab better. Anyone else taking *Statistics with R specialization* from *Coursera*?
12/14/20, 9:16 PM - +36 30 519 3037: Hi Fernando, I am involved in IBM Statistics for data Science with Python: https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistics-for-data-science-python
12/14/20, 9:17 PM - +36 30 519 3037: Greetings from Central Europe /Tamas
12/14/20, 9:46 PM - +52 444 323 2525: Thank you for your response!
How have you found that course so far'
12/15/20, 8:03 AM - +91 96011 91362 changed this group's icon
12/15/20, 2:00 AM - +36 30 519 3037: Your welcome, can I ask you why did you choose R and Matlab? I always read and hear that Python is the number one language on this field int he industry.
12/15/20, 2:21 AM - +52 444 323 2525: Sure, hmmm I can't really tell: general purpose programming languages seem too broad; choosing a specific one kind of narrows the options. I also like the interface :- }
12/15/20, 2:37 AM - +36 30 519 3037: This can be true
12/15/20, 2:38 AM - +36 30 519 3037: Actually I choose Python because the market says "choose Python"
12/15/20, 2:38 AM - +36 30 519 3037: especially on more technical fields
12/15/20, 2:39 AM - +36 30 519 3037: have you already tried to get freelance stitistics jobs/assignments with R/Matlab?
12/15/20, 2:40 AM - +36 30 519 3037: (I go to sleep now, it is 22:40 by me, I reply tomorrow!:)  )
12/15/20, 11:21 AM - DS Puneet: Market also says DS is hard to survive. Will you stop then ? Choose any language
12/15/20, 11:21 AM - DS Puneet: It actually depends on your needs.
12/15/20, 11:22 AM - DS Puneet: If you have limited time and looking for a new job asap then go with python.
12/15/20, 11:22 AM - DS Puneet: If you are in college with no programming background and mad about statistics. Then go with R
12/15/20, 11:23 AM - DS Puneet: R is messy as compared to python and you will forget it more than python.
12/15/20, 11:23 AM - DS Puneet: But I have seen myself getting addicted to R after beating the initial few months.
12/15/20, 11:25 AM - DS Puneet: Also tool doesn't matter. If you are new. I will say to go with python considering the whole scenerio.
12/15/20, 11:46 AM - +36 30 519 3037: "Market also says DS is hard to survive. " - Which market do you mean more exactly? The World is big
12/15/20, 11:47 AM - +91 75066 45805: everyone move on from this discussion, choose whatever program you like
12/15/20, 11:47 AM - +91 75066 45805: Coding is really the easiest part of the whole DS thing
12/15/20, 11:47 AM - +91 94307 23304: Lol
12/15/20, 11:47 AM - +91 75066 45805: Learning the math is the hardest. If you can do that you can work on any program
12/15/20, 11:48 AM - +36 30 519 3037: That's true, DS requires minimal proramming knowledge
12/15/20, 11:51 AM - +91 75066 45805: I think ML needs a little more, but it
12/15/20, 11:51 AM - +91 75066 45805: it's very hard to do ML alone*. The processing requirements are so high, apart from anything else
12/15/20, 11:53 AM - +91 94307 23304: By "it's very hard to do ML alone", do you mean the hardware requirements are very high for one person?
12/15/20, 11:53 AM - +91 75066 45805: yeah
12/15/20, 2:16 PM - +36 30 519 3037: Has anyone here already tried and finished the IBM Data Science Professional certificate? https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science
12/15/20, 2:18 PM - +234 903 064 3902: Yes
12/15/20, 2:21 PM - +36 30 519 3037: thanks, and did you try to find a DS position in the IBM talant pool after that? I have to finish 2 and a half courses of that and then the System Will connect me to the IBM talent pool but I don't know how serious opportunity is that.
12/15/20, 2:22 PM - +36 30 519 3037: I hope I will finish this certificate in the next weeks
12/15/20, 2:22 PM - +234 903 064 3902: Just a hearing about IBM talent pool for the first timeüôÅüôÅ

After I finished the course, I had to work on a pending project
12/15/20, 2:22 PM - +234 903 064 3902: Shed more light on IBM talent pooll
12/15/20, 2:23 PM - +36 30 519 3037: I will copy the IBM message about the talant pool in some minutes
12/15/20, 2:24 PM - +36 30 519 3037: do you work on this pending project for IBM? or for your University?
12/15/20, 2:24 PM - +234 903 064 3902: Thanks
12/15/20, 2:32 PM - +36 30 519 3037: "Completion of the course also provides the program participants with access to join IBM‚Äôs Talent Network. For any data science career aspirant, this network can be very valuable as it provides numerous tools needed to land a dream job with IBM, recommendations, alongside making many opportunities at IBM directly accessible."
12/15/20, 2:33 PM - +36 30 519 3037: tlent pool means "IBM Talent Network"
12/15/20, 2:34 PM - +234 903 064 3902: Thanks
12/15/20, 2:34 PM - +234 903 064 3902: I will look that up today
12/15/20, 2:35 PM - +36 30 519 3037: I will sen you a  screenshot also

12/15/20, 2:41 PM - +234 903 064 3902: I Will definitelyüòÅ
12/15/20, 2:42 PM - +36 30 519 3037: :D nice to here
12/15/20, 5:01 PM - +91 94264 53838: What one should know in python or how much coding is sufficient?
12/15/20, 5:01 PM - +91 75066 45805: Well what do you want to _do_ in python
12/15/20, 5:02 PM - +91 94264 53838: ML & DS
12/15/20, 5:02 PM - +36 30 519 3037: If you can perform Data Cleaning, Basic Web scraping, API writing and modelling in Python it should be ok for start
12/15/20, 5:03 PM - +36 30 519 3037: also Statistics in Python is important
12/15/20, 5:03 PM - +91 75066 45805: Those are subjects, not what you're doing
12/15/20, 5:03 PM - +91 75066 45805: Once you know what you actually want to do, you can Google the code or a course and learn it
12/15/20, 5:03 PM - +91 94264 53838: So for data cleaning - Pandas
Web scrapping - Beautiful Soup
I don't know much about API
12/15/20, 5:03 PM - +36 30 519 3037: for these topics you need very basics of Python and then you have to practice it thes etopics
12/15/20, 5:04 PM - +91 94264 53838: So you mean to say we can't do Machine Learning in python?
12/15/20, 5:05 PM - +91 96011 91362: For DS learn python data structures like list,tuple, dictionary, class , function, enumeration, decorator's etc.. and for ML learn Numpy,sk learn earn, pandas etc.. for begining or quick startüëç
12/15/20, 5:05 PM - +36 30 519 3037: take a look at this in free audit mode: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science
12/15/20, 5:05 PM - +36 30 519 3037: it Will help you to understand what you need
12/15/20, 5:05 PM - +36 30 519 3037: in python
12/15/20, 5:05 PM - +91 94264 53838: Thanks Manüëç
12/15/20, 5:05 PM - +91 94264 53838: Thanksüëç
12/15/20, 5:06 PM - +36 30 519 3037: welcome
12/15/20, 5:06 PM - +91 75066 45805: No I mean if you're saying you will be doing 'machine learning' then you still don't actually have any idea what you want to do. And you should start with figuring that out
12/15/20, 5:06 PM - +91 75066 45805: Both natural language processing and climate change modeling can use data science or ML
12/15/20, 5:06 PM - +91 75066 45805: They don't require the same training
12/15/20, 5:06 PM - +91 94264 53838: You are asking which domain do I want to apply those skills?
12/15/20, 5:07 PM - +91 75066 45805: If you know, then you should Google courses and books with domain+data science
12/15/20, 5:07 PM - +36 30 519 3037: and this one in free audit mode: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-fundamentals-python-sql
12/15/20, 5:07 PM - +91 75066 45805: And study those
12/15/20, 5:07 PM - +91 94264 53838: Okay thanks

12/19/20, 7:39 AM - +52 444 323 2525: I really like the _guided projects_ in Coursera, but it's very basic and does not cover many softwares. Does anyone know where to find similar guided versions?
Kind regards,
12/19/20, 7:43 AM - +91 94307 23304: +1 yes, please
12/19/20, 8:11 AM - +91 95092 49507: +2
12/19/20, 8:12 AM - +91 95092 49507: Yes , they are pretty good for beginners, in order to get used to the real experience but they are very basic.

12/19/20, 9:05 PM - +52 444 323 2525: Another way I've found, but it isn't as exciting, is to search for books titled "Practical..." or "...with solutions", e. g., "Practical SQL...". That way, the book has guided exercises.
Finally, MIT's open courses do have exercises.

I have continuous footage of cctv for weeks in area where waterlogging is persistent. What techniques can be used to measure height of water over 30 min intervals

I think you should know how your cctv works and its additional feature (object detection feed).

To calculate the height, pythagoras theorem maybe ü§î

The float object could place in the water which CCTV detect for height of water later

10/13/21, 8:14 AM - +91 97171 20350: Will check that out
10/13/21, 8:15 AM - +91 97171 20350: I also checked a paper where we can use reference object like how much car tyres are submerged to predict amount of rainfall
