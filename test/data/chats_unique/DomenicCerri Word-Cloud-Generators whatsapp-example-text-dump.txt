1/19/20, 6:21 PM - John: This video popped into my recommendations today... hmmm (pretty cool though)
1/19/20, 6:42 PM - Jack: Hey, John: he's really measuring sound blocking as opposed to absorption. The test Mic should be placed on the same side as the source, facing the material being tested to detect energy bouncing back and the test materials should be attached to a rigid, flat surface (wall).. Also the frequencies are too high. Spoken word is in a range of roughly 500-1200 Hz.  But his accent and use of the word "rubbish" are cool 😎.
1/19/20, 6:43 PM - Jack: Hey, Jill: is Froggie wearing a NASA space suit in that photo?
1/19/20, 7:06 PM - John: Huh that's interesting- so it would keep people from hearing you on the other side of a wall, but maybe not  improve reverb so much
1/19/20, 7:08 PM - Tia: Yep that's right
1/19/20, 7:09 PM - Tia: He should have used a lower noise to get a vibration sort of example and maybe to numb the vibration this kind of stuff would help
1/19/20, 7:37 PM - Jack: Egg crate and packing foam work. Also, avoiding parallel surfaces.

3/12/20, 8:21 PM - Jill: How’s everyone holding up?
3/12/20, 8:21 PM - Jane: So cute!!! I’m ordering essentials for dBovery now. Nyc declared state of emerJillcy.
3/12/20, 8:21 PM - Jill: Yeah nc did too
3/12/20, 8:22 PM - Jane: Schools are still open though? So confused
3/12/20, 8:22 PM - Jill: Schools here are closed starting Monday
3/12/20, 8:22 PM - Jill: UNC is moving to online classes
3/12/20, 8:27 PM - Tanta: Im working remotely indefinitely
3/12/20, 8:27 PM - Tanta: Schools are open because too many kids depend on school for food and safety
3/12/20, 9:09 PM - Jack: Schools are closing here also starting Monday.
3/12/20, 9:27 PM - Jane: Froggies gonna go to school tomorrow. I will keep following to see what to do next week. Hard as an entrepreneur- what to do when the kid’s home? 🤷‍♀
3/12/20, 9:41 PM - Mita: 😍 Is she eating spinach?!
3/12/20, 9:43 PM - Jill: Yup!

3/12/20, 9:49 PM - Mita: So cute😄🥬💪🏼
3/12/20, 9:50 PM - Jack: But at least you can work from home, Jill, if N.Y.closes
3/12/20, 9:50 PM - Jack: Iron baby!
3/14/20, 4:58 PM - Jane: How’s everyone holding up? Work from home is really difficult with Froggie here. Trying to figure out how to get $ from Gwen to get an assistant, but looks like he’s staying in school until they close them down. Not my favorite option. Fingers crossed!
3/14/20, 5:03 PM - John: Yeah our daycare is open for now, but when it closes idk how we will get anything done. MB is stir crazy already after 2 days at home lol
3/14/20, 5:15 PM - Tanta: Yesterday we were all pretty anxious and on edge trying to figure out how to work from home with Bo
3/14/20, 5:15 PM - Tanta: Today we leaned into the free time and the new normal a bit
3/14/20, 5:21 PM - Jill: <Media omitted>
3/14/20, 5:21 PM - Jill: Tho wouldn’t work for Baby of course
3/14/20, 5:22 PM - Jane: Like it!
3/14/20, 5:25 PM - Jill: I’m def already stir crazy! If we have to keep Baby home we will prob have to work after she goes to bed and during naps..... idk how that will work
3/14/20, 5:30 PM - Tanta: I did that with Bo for about a year when I worked for Gwen lol you get into a rhythm eventually
3/14/20, 5:31 PM - Jill: That must have been so tough!!
3/14/20, 5:35 PM - Jane: Our water is getting shut down Monday too.
3/14/20, 5:35 PM - Jane: Indefinitely.
3/14/20, 5:35 PM - Jill: Whaaaaatt???
3/14/20, 5:35 PM - Jill: Why??
3/14/20, 5:36 PM - Jill: That is like the worst thing to do in an outbreak!
3/14/20, 5:36 PM - Jane: Dunno. Cause New York.
3/14/20, 5:37 PM - Jill: What will you do?
3/14/20, 5:38 PM - Jane: Dunno. Water in pans. I guess. Lol. So wild.
3/14/20, 5:42 PM - Jill: ☹
3/14/20, 6:01 PM - Tanta: Wait what
3/14/20, 6:01 PM - Tanta: Where’d you hear that?
3/14/20, 6:01 PM - Tanta: I need a source
3/14/20, 6:01 PM - Jane: My landlord. It’s particular to my area.
3/14/20, 6:02 PM - Tanta: That’s actually insane
3/14/20, 6:57 PM - Jack: So the water thing is not related to the corona virus right?
3/14/20, 7:25 PM - Jill: <Media omitted>
3/14/20, 7:41 PM - Tia: Dang high def
3/14/20, 7:41 PM - Tia: Hahaha cutieee

3/15/20, 6:41 PM - Tanta: NYC officially closed all schools bars and restaurants indefinitely
3/15/20, 7:12 PM - Jill: 😧
3/15/20, 7:23 PM - Mita: Home schooling now? Probably, right?
3/15/20, 7:49 PM - Jack: Hey, great. Is that grits?
3/15/20, 7:50 PM - Jill: Baby oatmeal
3/15/20, 7:50 PM - Tanta: Home... surviving? Lol
3/15/20, 7:50 PM - Jack: Cool.
3/15/20, 7:51 PM - Jill: Poll: should we keep Baby home from daycare? Will be harder for me to work, but I can work from home unlike healthcare providers, and taking her to daycare would be anti-social distancing
3/15/20, 7:54 PM - Jack: Is there any medical evidence that babies can be carriers? I don't think anyone under 19 had been symptomatic.
3/15/20, 8:00 PM - Jill: They can be carriers. Less likely to have symptoms than adults
3/15/20, 8:00 PM - Tanta: I say keep her home
3/15/20, 8:04 PM - John: I don't think well know if kids are less likely to get it until they test everyone, not just people with symptoms. There are many reported cases of sick children, and a few severe cases, but no fatalities yet under 10 yrs (the only age group)
3/15/20, 8:06 PM - Mita: Is worthy takinga risk?
3/15/20, 8:07 PM - Mita: Takinga🤣🤣
3/15/20, 8:08 PM - Jill: The concern is that we will risk our jobs by keeping her home bc we will be less productive.....
3/15/20, 8:12 PM - John: https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0191/v1
3/15/20, 8:20 PM - John: The gist of the science is that higher ACE2 receptor expression (young, female, east asian decent) increases chance of getting infected. However, higher ACE2 is also associated with fewer symptoms
3/15/20, 8:21 PM - John: So while old diabetic white dudes are least likely to get infected, they'll experience the worst symptoms
3/15/20, 8:22 PM - Jack: Seems fair enough 😏.
3/15/20, 8:23 PM - John: Pretty smart virus...
3/15/20, 8:23 PM - Jill: This all just feels so unreal
3/15/20, 8:30 PM - Jack: It does, but the pathologists have been warning us about a pandemic for many years. .conditions and modes of dispersion have been in place for a long time . It's disorienting, but we can't escape nature...we're part of it.  If we're smart and cool the odds seem pretty darn good for us.

3/21/20, 12:31 PM - Mita: ☝️The West Aurora Choir (IL, USA) did this video of Stephen Paulus' 'Road Home.' The students "learned their parts independently ... . They collaborated to agree on musical details, recorded their parts individually mostly using their phones while watching a conducting video. Enjoy!😍

3/24/20, 9:01 PM - Jane: I just danced naked in the living room and screamed while Tito read old assignments. Froggie keeps bitching about everything and I’m running out of ideas to entertain him. I haven’t been outside since Saturday. But otherwise great!!!

3/26/20, 8:31 AM - Jack: You can still go out to buy groceries and take a walk though, right?
3/26/20, 8:34 AM - Jill: Yeah
3/26/20, 8:41 AM - John: No walks I thought?
3/26/20, 8:46 AM - Jack: Even if folks keep 6 feet away from each other?
3/26/20, 8:57 AM - Tanta: isolated walks are okay

3/27/20, 9:58 AM - Mita: Good morning everybody ☀️ We need to set a zoom family meeting today to talk about the situation in NY. We can do at 4:00pm.
3/27/20, 10:05 AM - Jane: I’m working all day long until Monday. I’m free tonight at 730pm after 10 hours of work :(
3/27/20, 10:05 AM - Jane: Poor Froggie watching 8 hours of movies lol
3/27/20, 10:05 AM - Jill: We are free pretty much whenever
3/27/20, 10:12 AM - Tanta: We can do whatever time
3/27/20, 10:13 AM - Mita: Any break at all?
3/27/20, 10:15 AM - Jane: Nope
3/27/20, 10:19 AM - Mita: Is 8:00pm  good for everybody?
3/27/20, 10:20 AM - Jill: Works for us
3/27/20, 1:24 PM - Jack: Mita and I would like to found out how all of you New Yorkers are doing. The news can be alarming and misleading.
3/27/20, 1:24 PM - Jack: Find
3/27/20, 1:34 PM - Tanta: For us, every day we try to cope with the anxiety. We have been able to keep our pantry stocked through online dBoveries but that is starting to become less rBoable. Our biggest concern is if and when one of us get sick, how will we cope with trying to quarantine that person in the house and the other person taking on the brunt of everything else. Also, if it gets to the point of hospitalBoation - there's no guarantee of getting proper medical attention because our hospitals are already overwhelmed. Otherwise, we try to keep our minds and bodies busy - working out, giving Bo some structure with her schoolwork in the mornings, crafts, dance parties, and some limited outdoor time. We wish we could have left the city earlier, but at this point we are probably are going to have to ride this out as best we can here (unless a magical empty house appears somewhere).
3/27/20, 1:55 PM - Jack: So let's schedule a family meeting on Zoom asap. If not tonight then maybe Jill can get free for 10 min over the weekend?
3/27/20, 6:19 PM - Tio: I propose tonight at 9:30 (hopefully the children are sleeping) or tomorrow after 10am?
3/27/20, 6:34 PM - Mita: Thank you David. Is a good time for us. We really want to have this meeting with you guys.
3/27/20, 6:47 PM - John: Yeah whenever you guys want
3/27/20, 6:52 PM - Jack: We need Jillevieve too. Any chance you're free at 9:30?

3/27/20, 8:01 PM - Jane: Sorry guys I just got done working. I’m so exhausted 😩 i can’t stay up past 930- I have two more days of this online event and it’s really challenging. I can do 9? Otherwise ummm Monday. Tomorrow night’s event goes until 11pm.  Sunday night goes until 8, I could do between 8-9 Sunday as well.
3/27/20, 8:01 PM - Tio: 9 is fine for us
3/27/20, 8:02 PM - Jane: Okay I’ll charge my
Phone up in case 9 works for everyone else!

3/31/20, 9:23 AM - Jack: Stay positive, man and keep that good sense of humor. I like the "doo doo doo" message on the screen.

3/31/20, 10:08 AM - Jack: 👌😌
3/31/20, 10:09 AM - Jack: Hey John, is there a baby shark video for Chapel Hill folks, too? I haven't seen one for Boring.
3/31/20, 10:31 AM - Tia: 😂😂😂 Thanks!
3/31/20, 10:50 AM - Jill: We are definitely thinking of you, NYC folks! Let us know if there’s anything we can do/send from afar 💕
3/31/20, 10:50 AM - Tio: 🙏🏻
3/31/20, 1:48 PM - Jane: Froggie and I both have mild cold symptoms. He’s had a stomach ache for over a week. I’ve had sneezes. But otherwise we’ll fine. Work is picking up which makes me feel safer and more secure with finances. Froggie is enjoying all his screen time 🤷‍♀
3/31/20, 2:21 PM - Tanta: My phone is back!
3/31/20, 2:56 PM - Jack: Hey, Jill. I hope this means you and Frogster have mild cases and will build immunity.  Love from Pops!
3/31/20, 3:36 PM - Mita: 😟I hope you guys feel better soon.  Focus in your diet to keep your immuno system up 🙏🏼
3/31/20, 3:36 PM - Mita: Yeyyy!!😍👍🏼
3/31/20, 3:38 PM - Mita: Love the dance👍🏼🤣🤣😄
3/31/20, 4:01 PM - Jane: Yeah that’s what I’m thinking! We’re both feBong good. Sleeping a lot and having a lot of green juice! Tito is staying away for now since they don’t have symptoms.

3/31/20, 4:57 PM - Jane: @19991119999 where did you get groceries for dBovery? All of my normal options aren’t dBovering. Instacart is out and amazon fresh too it looks like?
3/31/20, 5:10 PM - Tia: 🤣🤣🤣
3/31/20, 5:13 PM - Tanta: We did instacart but the dBovery dates are always a few days away - sometimes next week so we have to stagger it
3/31/20, 5:14 PM - Tia: That's pretty amazing really cool
3/31/20, 5:14 PM - Jane: Instacart’s down now. Just tried. Froggie’s lactose intolerant all of a sudden so I need to get some things. I heard the local grocers will dBover!

4/2/20, 9:44 AM - John: https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections conservative projections updated daily
4/2/20, 9:54 AM - Jack: I hope the downward part of the curve is at least as steep as projected. This projection assumes that social distancing will be maintained, right?
4/2/20, 9:58 AM - Jack: Also, the shaded area is way too big for any hint of comfort.
4/2/20, 10:12 AM - John: The curve going down starts about 3-4 weeks after social distancing measures are implemented, the slope is steeper of there are more regulations in place and/or more local resources
4/2/20, 10:14 AM - John: You can see a lot of differences between states
4/2/20, 10:15 AM - Jill: This was an interesting article about how the numbers are calculated https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/01/824744490/5-key-facts-the-white-house-isnt-saying-about-their-covid-19-projections
4/2/20, 10:18 AM - Jack: Yeah, and states with dense cities are hurting the most. Baltimore is on its way to being a disaster area as is the DC metro area. Rest of state is doing ok thanks to early restrictions.

4/2/20, 10:17 PM - Jack: That's all wonderful news, Jill! Now Tanta needs to feel better..soon no doubt.

4/27/20, 1:17 PM - Jane: That’s what people say?
4/27/20, 1:26 PM - Jack: Sure, but it's also twice as much food and poop. Probably worth it though 😉
4/27/20, 1:27 PM - Tanta: yeah we had two for like 4 years, it's not bad at all
4/27/20, 1:28 PM - Tanta: but its up to you

4/27/20, 1:28 PM - Mita: Ask Tito. How is she by the way?
4/27/20, 1:55 PM - Tanta: Also just wanted to say thank you to everyone for contributing funds for us after David’s mom’s passing. It’s extremely helpful to not have to think about cooking for everyone while dealing with logistics and emotions. Thank you family ❤️

4/28/20, 7:42 PM - John: Yum- I've heard to look out for that one, invasive but really tasty when picked at the right time. Doesn't look like wild garlic mustard was ever cultivated like the wild mustard weed? I wonder why.
4/28/20, 7:55 PM - Jack: Good question...maybe because, like the dandBoon it gets very bitter when it matures. Gotta know when to pick em.

4/30/20, 2:09 PM - John: Depends on your price range- not sure if you ran the numbers yet but if you want a car for more then 2 years consider financing, even a 2017-2018 for about 40% less than new.
4/30/20, 2:12 PM - John: Anyway you know dad and I love our CRVs (just got a big update in 2017 too)... if you want to go a little lower the recent rav4s are good, a little higher the mazda 3 or subaru outback/crosstrek
4/30/20, 2:15 PM - Tio: The rav4 is awesome
4/30/20, 2:16 PM - John: That's the mazda cx-3 not 3.
4/30/20, 2:18 PM - John: I wanted the rav4 but marybeth did like that it like one star less safety rating in one category than the crv 😅
4/30/20, 2:20 PM - Mita: agree 👍🏼😃

5/26/20, 1:30 PM - Jane: Hahah yeah. He thinks he’s a ninja
5/26/20, 1:31 PM - Jane: Gonna get a Subaru on Saturday. Safest car. Considering that I don’t know how to drive 😂🤣 I’m scared to even test drive it! No idea how I got my license haha
5/26/20, 2:22 PM - Jill: <Media omitted>

5/28/20, 10:06 AM - Jane: Hey fam- any reason NOT to buy a used car with low mileage? Seems like that makes the most sense!
5/28/20, 10:23 AM - Jack: Check the carfax history to make sure it wasn't in a major accident, flood, or used commercially. They offering any kind of warranty? Is it certified? Do you have a friend with mechanical knowledge? Notwithstanding all those apparent disclaimers, yes I suggest buying a used car even though the ripoff risk is higher because new cars depreciate unfairly and lock you into a bigger investment. Honda and Toyota I think have better used track records than Subaru.
5/28/20, 10:37 AM - John: Yeah its almost always the best value to buy 2 years old or older. Basically you want to be past the steepest part of the curve for best return. https://usedfirst.com/cars/subaru/forester/
5/28/20, 10:39 AM - Jane: Thanks guys! Super helpful! Will probably go with a used forester- based off of safety ratings and value/prices.
5/28/20, 10:39 AM - Jane: Test driving it on Saturday
5/28/20, 10:40 AM - Jane: Tito is calling them to check on all the things you mentioned, pops 👌
5/28/20, 10:41 AM - John: Cool. Btw call your car insurance company before you buy- get a quote ready so you aren't waiting to drive it off the lot
5/28/20, 10:41 AM - Jane: Thanks! They’re bringing the car to us due to COVID
5/28/20, 10:42 AM - John: Ooh that's nice
5/28/20, 10:42 AM - Jack: How many miles on it? Any warranty included? Make sure you check the heater,AC, and tires (all can be expensive to fix or replace). Get the carfax report before you drive it.
5/28/20, 10:43 AM - Jack: Expect that they'll try to rip you off. That's their business.
5/28/20, 10:43 AM - Jane: John how does car insurance work? I remember when Gwen bought hers they just signed her up for one at the dealership
5/28/20, 10:45 AM - Jane: The used ones have about 24 thousand miles on them. I can’t remmeber the warranties but they have them. We’re deciding between two used ones and one new one. Dad, can I email you the ones we’re looking at?
5/28/20, 10:45 AM - Jack: You have USAA John, right? Jill I think you qualify. They are usually cheaper and rBoable. I don't recommend signing up for anything through a dealer.
5/28/20, 10:45 AM - Jane: Okay 👌
5/28/20, 10:45 AM - Jack: Email what you have sure
5/28/20, 10:46 AM - Jack: Are you paying cash or financing?
5/28/20, 10:46 AM - Jane: Cash if they make me a deal
5/28/20, 10:47 AM - Jane: I think lol
5/28/20, 10:47 AM - John: What? Lol. You can call or go online to find all the options out there, don't go with a dealer option. However you can change insurance plans almost without penalty at any time.I can't recommend one because insurance premiums vary by state (basically number of customers/ claims in the area).
5/28/20, 10:47 AM - Jane: Okay awesome
5/28/20, 10:47 AM - Jane: I’ll look online
5/28/20, 10:47 AM - Jane: WHY DONT THEY HAVE A CLASS IN BUYING A CAR IN COLLEGE?!
5/28/20, 10:47 AM - John: We switched from USAA to progressive and saved about 20 percent
5/28/20, 10:52 AM - Jack: Hmm, maybe I'll switch. Progressive did reorganBoe a few years back.
5/28/20, 10:54 AM - Jane: On another note, tested negative for COVID antibodies and somehow Tito tested positive. Makes ZERO sense.
5/28/20, 10:55 AM - John: When you ask for a quote, they will provide the state minimums for coverage based on your info. I'd recommend getting the minimum with highest deductible, except increase your liability to 100k/200k or more (this covers damage to other vehicles but also medical stuff if you injure someone), personal injury can stay low- this is for people hurt in your car which medical insurance covers unless they sue (bigger deal if you drive strangers), collision coverage should be the value of your car, finally comprehensive is not needed at all (this is for vandalism or damage to your car when you aren't driving, almost never worth the deductible)
5/28/20, 10:59 AM - Jane: Thanks!!
5/28/20, 11:02 AM - John: Your insurance premium will go up whenever there is a claim on your insurance or points on your license, and that increase means you pay back a big chunk of what was covered over time (like a weird loan), and it increases exponentially with more claims. So basically get a high deductible and plan to never use it unless absolutely necessarily.
5/28/20, 11:03 AM - John: Oh last thing, we really like that our insurance covers a rental car, would recommend paying a couple bucks for that option.
5/28/20, 11:06 AM - Tia: That's very weird. Did you get Froggie tested too?
5/28/20, 11:07 AM - Tia: Wait, the antibodies mean that u can fight the disease off, so that means you cant and Tito can?
5/28/20, 11:08 AM - Tia: Tito may have already had the virus but showed no symptoms, this is why they would have tested positive for the antibodies.
5/28/20, 11:10 AM - John: It may just be the tests, they all have a degree of sensitivity and selectivity, these usually are a trade off, and relate to false negatives and false positives, respectively
5/28/20, 11:12 AM - Tia: Right yeah since this is all new, the tests probably aren't as developed as they need to be and can dBover the false positives and negatives
5/28/20, 11:16 AM - Jane: I def had it- I gave it to Tito 😂 don’t want to test Froggie because of the exposure at the doctor’s office. Who knows haha. This is all so strange.
5/28/20, 11:17 AM - Jane: Well maybe not “definitely”
5/28/20, 11:17 AM - Jane: Lol
5/28/20, 11:17 AM - Tia: Hahaha oh boy

6/4/20, 5:31 PM - Tanta: never heard you say Yerr before, why now?
6/4/20, 5:32 PM - John: I don't hut that sign is using it very enthusiastically!
6/4/20, 5:33 PM - Tia: Uhhhh yerrrrr?
6/4/20, 5:33 PM - Tia: Plz explain
6/4/20, 5:34 PM - Tia: OHHHHH
6/4/20, 5:34 PM - Tia: ITS ON THE SIGN
6/4/20, 5:35 PM - John: Isn't it a NY thing?
6/4/20, 5:42 PM - Jack: What does it mean?
6/4/20, 6:08 PM - Jane: Yerrrr is a NY thing. Means “yes.” F*ck 12 is F the police.
6/4/20, 6:08 PM - Jane: I just think the shot is artistically really beautiful, but yaall went in 🤣
6/4/20, 6:09 PM - Tia: 🤣🤣🤣 yeah I was gonna say it is a beautiful photo
6/4/20, 6:12 PM - Tanta: I think this family could use a dose of going in actually
6/4/20, 6:12 PM - Tia: Wdym
6/4/20, 6:17 PM - Tanta: We’ve never talked explicitly about racism, and the amount of microaggressions that I’ve felt being a part of this family only reflect that there’s a lot of work to be done in confronting whiteness
6/4/20, 6:18 PM - Tanta: I’m happy to provide some readings and an avenue to discuss them
6/4/20, 6:20 PM - Jane: Hearing you Tanta ❤ want to do a zoom with the fam soon as well? And reading list is a yes on my end.
6/4/20, 6:23 PM - Jane: Also, Thank you :)
6/4/20, 6:24 PM - Jill: Yes thanks for saying this, Tanta! I would love to be part of these conversations
6/4/20, 6:37 PM - Tanta: Let’s do it. And to clarify what sparked my question @19991119999 is that a comment like that by a white person on a picture of Black people protesting for the right to exist is invalAbuelitating
6/4/20, 6:39 PM - Tanta: Especially when you’re unclear what the phrase means or the power that it holds
6/4/20, 6:42 PM - Tanta: Seemingly small instances like this build up to the greater systemic problem we’re all finally confronting
6/4/20, 6:42 PM - Tanta: I’ll be back with research and peer reviewed resources
6/4/20, 6:57 PM - John: Ah thanks for pointing that out Tanta! We'll be doing some reading
6/4/20, 8:22 PM - Jack: You're right, Jill. It's a great photo. Manhattan looks like a citadel and the group looks far away like the castle is almost out of reach.   In fact, isn't Manhattan symbolic of systemic oppression of all kinds?  Any of you guys Biden supporters? Hmmm?
6/4/20, 8:35 PM - Tia: I feel like being apart of this family for all of these years you should know that we are not racist and we do not let the color of our skin define who we are. Just because the majority of the family is white does not mean that a comment on a photo of black people protesting is invalAbuelitating the right of black people to fight for their lives. I am sorry that you feel that skin color defines our actions but you are also a part of this family and we love you so much and I tottalh respect your opinion but I do feel offended because I dont want it to look like just because I have a white skin color that that automatically puts me in the category of racist and unaccepting to the protests. I appreciate you sharing your feBongs with us but please be conscious of how it can affect the ones you love and who love you.
6/4/20, 8:42 PM - John: I get how it comes across that way Tia, but I don't think this isnt just about racism in our family  it's about systemic racism in everyone.
6/4/20, 8:43 PM - Tanta: Thanks Tia I love you too, this is an important conversation to have. Yes it does mean that. And it is not enough to not be racist, we must all be actively Anti-Racist. This is uncomfortable and hard work, I know.
6/4/20, 8:44 PM - John: We were raised to not see color, treat others as we want to be treated. But that isn't good enough because it perpetuates the issues and leaves the burden of racism on those affected most by it
6/4/20, 8:44 PM - John: Yup
6/4/20, 8:45 PM - Tia: Okay I get that but why do you say you have microagressions being apart of this family?
6/4/20, 8:45 PM - Tia: I must have taken that the wrong way
6/4/20, 8:47 PM - Tanta: No, you didn’t take it the wrong way. Whether intended or not, there have been times where I’ve felt extremely uncomfortable by comments about my ethnicity. To be honest, growing up in Pikesville it was so common that I didn’t even understand why it felt so wrong.
6/4/20, 8:48 PM - Tia: So I'm confused what you ment by family then
6/4/20, 8:50 PM - Tanta: That’s not me saying I don’t love my family, or that I’m not grateful to have you in my life. But it does mean that I haven’t always felt safe or seen in space that should feel welcoming
6/4/20, 8:50 PM - Tia: I acctually curious about this logorithm, if everyone was raised the same way then why do we have such different views on race and ethnicity? I'm not sure if I worded the question right, let me know if I need to clarify lol
6/4/20, 8:51 PM - Tanta: So it means we just need to talk about what this means and how we can do better for each other and the world
6/4/20, 8:51 PM - Tia: I didn't say you didnt love us lol I mean like how did you feel unwelcome and do you still feel unwelcome?
6/4/20, 8:52 PM - Tia: I understand
6/4/20, 8:52 PM - Tia: I dont want to go digging deep into this family's history tho cause that's all in the past
6/4/20, 8:54 PM - Tanta: I feel like there’s plenty we could learn from our family’s history. I really don’t think we’ve ever delved into how the blending of our families has impacted us
6/4/20, 8:55 PM - Tia: Okay yeah I get that, we shouldn't do it over text tho cause that's a lot to talk about over text
6/4/20, 8:55 PM - Tanta: agreed lol
6/4/20, 8:55 PM - Tia: Maybe we should talk about it more because we dont know how the blending of families has impacted everyone
6/4/20, 8:56 PM - Tia: Its important that we know how you feel and that you can tell us what you feel.
6/4/20, 8:57 PM - Jane: catching up on all of this now guys. I’m grateful this conversation is being had. It’s super important that every one of us feels safe, loved, valAbuelitated, seen, and heard, and that reparations are made whenever that’s a problem. We do whatever it takes to make sure that happens. If nothing else, having this conversation will model that super important behavior for you @19991119999 . I didn’t learn how to do that well until a few years ago, so it’ll be great to have you on the call. The earliest that I could do is Sunday at 8pm?
6/4/20, 8:58 PM - Tia: I agree
6/4/20, 8:58 PM - John: It's because we had different life experiences and those were shaped by the color of our skin, our Jillder, our identity. If you've been impacted this way you have an awareness of the issues that goes beyond just knowing that there are issues in Jilleral
6/4/20, 8:59 PM - Tia: Ohhh okay yes I understand that.
6/4/20, 9:03 PM - Tanta: Realistically I can’t do it until Thursday or FrAbuelitay of next week
6/4/20, 9:03 PM - Tia: I'm confused by the second part of that text lol
6/4/20, 9:04 PM - Jack: Hey don't forget my Joe Biden question. It's relevant in perhaps unexpected ways.
6/4/20, 9:04 PM - Tanta: Lol Biden is trash
6/4/20, 9:04 PM - Tanta: But Trump is a dumpster fire so.....
6/4/20, 9:05 PM - John: Pretty much. I'll vote for Biden as a form of harm reduction
6/4/20, 9:05 PM - Jane: I can do 830pm thurs or fri next week
6/4/20, 9:05 PM - Tia: Same here on thurs
6/4/20, 9:05 PM - Jane: Let’s not go into politics via text yaall ❤
6/4/20, 9:05 PM - Tia: 😂😂😂
6/4/20, 9:06 PM - Tanta: Jack started it lol
6/4/20, 9:06 PM - Jack: Just wanted a poll, no pun intend
6/4/20, 9:06 PM - Tanta: @19991119999 can you do Thursday?
6/4/20, 9:07 PM - John: Dad are you guys forming a grassroots libertarian party in Boring or something?
6/4/20, 9:09 PM - Jack: Not a bad idea, but we'd end up beating the crap out of each other before we could get a thing organBoed.
6/4/20, 9:09 PM - Jill: Thursday is my birthday actually! My socially distanced friend and our now part time nanny was going to celebrate with us. Is FrAbuelitay possible? Otherwise we can prob make Thursday work
6/4/20, 9:09 PM - Tanta: FrAbuelitay works!
6/4/20, 9:10 PM - Tia: Heel yeah
6/4/20, 9:10 PM - Tanta: And happy early birthday!
6/4/20, 9:10 PM - Tia: You already know wassup

6/4/20, 9:10 PM - Tia: 😂😂
6/4/20, 9:10 PM - Jill: Thank you! :)
6/4/20, 9:16 PM - Tanta: I’m gonna set up a Zoom for next FrAbuelitay at 8:30 and send materials that we can all look at beforehand

6/9/20, 8:46 PM - John: Whaa I had no idea such places existed. Still, our idea of the beach this year is a hose and Baby's kiddie pool 😀
6/9/20, 8:47 PM - Mita: Wow!!! It's close to you and Jill. Right?
6/9/20, 8:47 PM - Tanta: Like an hour away

*What makes me sad? Boo boo

*How tall am I? Hmm... big! 

*What's my favorite thing to do? TOYS! 

*What is my favorite food? Hmm.. strawberries (nope) 

*What is my favorite drink? Hmm.. juice (WRONG, it’s coffee!)

*If I could go anywhere, where would I go? Hmm.. nothing (that’s kinda true, I don’t actually enjoy travBong) 

*Do you think you could live without me? Yeah (bitch please!)) 

*How do I annoy you? Ha... mama! (Lol)

*What is my favorite TV show? Mickey! No blippi! (again, HIS favorite)

*What is my favorite music to listen to? Hmm... applesauce! (When in doubt, respond with food) 

*What is my job? Hmm.. clapping! (Basically)

*How old am I? Hmm... a! (What?)

*What's my favorite color? Hmm... red! (BINGO!)

*How much do you love me? This much! ::put out his arms wide:: (TRIPLE BINGO!! 😍😍)

Copy, paste and change my answers and see what your child says!

2/21/21, 6:36 PM - Tia: Gets to like 2ft long
2/21/21, 7:23 PM - John: Anole lighting fine details- make sure cage has a mesh top (not solid plastic or glass) or UVB light won't pass in. Stick all of your lights on one side of the cage so they have a temperature gradient (other side is cool and dark). Get a 2 in 1 light figure with a UVB bulb and a full spectrum incandescent heat light and put on a timer for 12-14 hours during the day, then if it drops below 70 at night I'd get a 3rd red heat light (specifically made for nocturnal reptiles) and have that turn on at night when the others are off.
2/21/21, 7:30 PM - John: Tropical hibiscus is another plant recommendation (as far as non toxic flowers go). Btw before putting plants in the terrarium, be sure to spray down the plants, rinse the pots, and maybe transplant to organic soil if you think there is any pesticides or artificial fertilBoer in there.
2/21/21, 7:31 PM - John: Ok that's all I got for now 😁

4/30/21, 8:27 PM - Mita: TO LEARN FROM ANIMAL BEING​

by John O'Donohue

Nearer to the earth’s heart,
Deeper within its silence:
Animals know this world
In a way we never will.
​
We who are ever
Distanced and distracted
By the parade of bright
Windows thought opens:
Their seamless presence
Is not fractured thus.
​
Stranded between time
Gone and time emerging,
We manage selJohn
To be where we are:
Whereas they are always
Looking out from
The here and now.
​
May we learn to return
And rest in the beauty
Of animal being,
Learn to lean low,
Leave our locked minds,
And with freed senses
Feel the earth
Breathing with us.
​
May we enter
Into lightness of spirit,
And slip frequently into
The feel of the wild.
​
Let the clear silence
Of our animal being
Cleanse our hearts
Of corrosive words.
​
May we learn to walk
Upon the earth
With all their confidence
And clear-eyed stillness
So that our minds
Might be baptBoed
In the name of the wind

And the light and the rain.

6/1/21, 5:34 PM - Tia: Im gonna start looking at resturaunts maybe cause theres a lot of demand for servers and stuff
6/1/21, 5:35 PM - Mita: 🤞
6/1/21, 5:36 PM - Tanta: Michael’s would be awesome because it’s retail and a little less fast paced than clothing stores, and you have lots of craft knowledge.
6/1/21, 5:37 PM - Tanta: Food service is intense! The demand is up but that’s because a lot of people weren’t happy with the working conditions, so I’d say be selective with the place if you can
6/1/21, 5:37 PM - John: If you do restaurants, drinks-only places are way more chill. Second food service being really intense.
6/1/21, 5:38 PM - John: Or maybe classic catering ahaha
6/1/21, 5:38 PM - Tanta: Oh lord catering lmao
6/1/21, 5:38 PM - Tanta: I was gonna say try hostessing
6/1/21, 5:39 PM - Tanta: That’s how I started and you get to learn the industry without being thrown into the fire
6/1/21, 5:41 PM - Tia: Yeesh
6/1/21, 5:41 PM - Tia: Uhhhh
6/1/21, 5:41 PM - Tia: Maybe ill stick with like cashiering lmao

6/1/21, 5:42 PM - Tia: Yes ofc
6/1/21, 5:42 PM - Tanta: No one ever forgets their first job lol
6/1/21, 5:42 PM - Tia: My dads looking at dunkin near our house

8/10/21, 8:54 PM - Jack: Yeah, but it's scary...hard to resist a bag of donuts in plain view.
8/10/21, 10:08 PM - Tia: I once put about 6 of them on a plate at home just nicely laid out and dad was like oh no this aint gon work. The temptation too strong 😭

8/17/21, 10:26 AM - Jane: Frogust is in a chess camp today ♟ with an international chess pro. It reminds me of going to ballet 🩰 camps as a kid. Pretty cut throat- just about the art of chess! He sat right down and starting playing. Amazing. So proud! I wish I could sit there all day and watch
8/17/21, 10:27 AM - John: He has the most interesting camps!
8/17/21, 10:29 AM - Jane: Makes me grateful to live in the big city, for sure!
8/17/21, 10:41 AM - Jack: Great that you found him a chess teacher...definitely has the right kind of mind for it. Meanwhile, I'll keep playing against the computer to be ready for the next Frogz chess match!

8/26/21, 12:58 PM - Jane: Y’all I’m doing my first full time hires in my company. What’s a good vacation/time off package? 2 weeks and then a certain amount of days? How do your companies do it for you? @19991119999 @19991119999  ?
8/26/21, 1:15 PM - John: With our nanny we gave them 2 weeks paid sick leave each year,  paid federal holAbuelitays, and 1 day paid vacation accrued each month. If salaried you don't need a provision for unpaid leave, but if hourly you might want to include one (maybe 1 wk-year). Because you are a small business (under 50 employees), any additional leave (like unpaid materity), is not typical or required (in NC at least).
8/26/21, 1:15 PM - Jane: Thanks!!
8/26/21, 1:16 PM - John: We'd highly recommend using an online payroll service to handle things. They are cheap (like $40 month) and the top rated ones have good support regarding tax and labor laws.
8/26/21, 1:16 PM - Jane: Yeah we have an online payroll already :)
8/26/21, 1:55 PM - Jill: In my current job I accrue 2 days/mo vacation and 1 day/mo sick leave - and it’s a huge plus of the job since it equates to about 4 weeks of vacation a year!
8/26/21, 3:45 PM - Jane: Thank you! I wanna be super nice so I may do that too
8/30/21, 11:03 AM - Jane: Love that they named a hurricane after aunt Abuelita’s tenacity 👏💕💜

9/2/21, 11:57 AM - Jill: NYC folks - how are you holding up with the hurricane weather?
9/2/21, 12:32 PM - Jane: All good- our basement is flooded but the landlord is taking care of it. We have a leak in the ceiling too. Nothing big

9/7/21, 10:19 AM - Mita: Good morning Familia, we have a question: do you guys have any plans for Thanksgiving?
9/7/21, 10:21 AM - Mita: 👨‍👩‍👧 We don't but would like to see if we can do a family gathering this year in NC.
9/7/21, 10:43 AM - John: We weren't planning anything. It will be tough for us though because we are still taking many precautions for Baby. Namely no contact with other kiddos unless outside and no one has symptoms, OR they are all able to isolate and get tested without potential exposures before meeting up. We'll either need to accept not being able to do much and pray for good/warm weather, or agree to pull everyone out of daycare/school for like a week beforehand.
9/7/21, 10:45 AM - Jill: Unless 5+ vaccines are approved before then and Froggie/Boana can get vaccinated?
9/7/21, 10:45 AM - John: That's like a 5% chance....
9/7/21, 10:45 AM - Jill: Wishful thinking.....
9/7/21, 10:45 AM - Jill: Sigh
9/7/21, 10:46 AM - Tia: Weren't we planning to meet at the pink house?
9/7/21, 10:46 AM - John: We could also just drive to MD to see you at different times this November- and hopefully get everyone together early next year if things get better
9/7/21, 10:51 AM - John: Yeah you guys hosting outside at the pink house would work. I was just thinking it might be a big ask for Tanta and Jill's crew to travel all the way here for that. Up to you all of course
9/7/21, 10:51 AM - Jack: They pink house idea might work better, because of the warmer weather in NC, and there is plenty of outdoor space there. Problem is that we'd probably have to reserve soon...and the Covid thing is unpredictable.
9/7/21, 10:52 AM - Tia: True
9/7/21, 12:08 PM - John: Pink house is great, but there are a lot of other options that would work in the area too. Bonus if you can find a covered porch or one with an extra room or two for the New Yorkers to stay in if they want.
9/7/21, 12:12 PM - John: ... or if you get a place next door to ours it wouldn't be too hard to use our porch to host https://abnb.me/MAtU5Qrtmjb
9/7/21, 12:16 PM - Tia: That looks really good
9/7/21, 1:36 PM - Jack: Let's see what the New Yorkers say and take it from there.
9/7/21, 7:20 PM - Tanta: I’m down to drive down, Boz gets tested weekly at her school so I’m comfortable with that
9/7/21, 7:21 PM - Tanta: I’d have to see if that works with her dad though, not sure what plans he may have yet
9/7/21, 7:25 PM - Jane: It’s tricky- that would be four days of driving for only one day of hanging out (I think)
9/7/21, 7:33 PM - Jack: It is probably a 10 hour drive from NYC.
9/7/21, 7:37 PM - John: Yeah I've done it a few times,  not too bad in a day with your average traffic, but holAbuelitay traffic might double it
9/7/21, 7:41 PM - John: <Media omitted>
9/7/21, 7:46 PM - John: Not quite as economical for 3...
