6/27/18, 10:32 AM - Jenit Jain: Hey bro. I was planning to start learning either frontend or backend. I know you know a few things in those things so can you tell me what all you know and advice me on what to start with
6/27/18, 10:32 AM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
6/27/18, 10:32 AM - Jenit Jain: üòÅ
6/27/18, 10:48 AM - Sahil Garg: Hey man, yeah that's chill, you're planning on web development or mobile or you haven't decided yet?
6/27/18, 10:49 AM - Sahil Garg: I tried out both, and then did android development more
6/27/18, 10:49 AM - Jenit Jain: Shit didn't think about that
6/27/18, 10:50 AM - Jenit Jain: Any specific reason?
6/27/18, 12:13 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah, they're different so you'll have to choose one only in start to begin with
6/27/18, 12:14 PM - Sahil Garg: I took it cause I thought developing for mobile is nice, and web programming was a lot of hassle, the front end itself has a lot of CSS and HTML
6/27/18, 12:15 PM - Sahil Garg: I basically learnt HTML and css basics for frontend in web, this is one way to learn it or you can see bootstrap etc which help you make frontend easily
6/27/18, 12:15 PM - Sahil Garg: And i saw videos on php
6/27/18, 12:15 PM - Sahil Garg: This is for web backend
6/27/18, 12:16 PM - Sahil Garg: For mobile, it's mostly Java
6/27/18, 12:21 PM - Jenit Jain: what about javascript and node js what are they used for
6/27/18, 12:27 PM - Sahil Garg: Right, so in mobile dev
6/27/18, 12:27 PM - Sahil Garg: You can do native app programming
6/27/18, 12:27 PM - Sahil Garg: Or a hybrid
6/27/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: Native means it works on a single platform like the only iOS
6/27/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: And hybrid apps work on all
6/27/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: This is for hybrid
6/27/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: This is native
6/27/18, 12:54 PM - Jenit Jain: But isn't this used for web dev too?
6/27/18, 12:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Ignore the call
6/27/18, 2:04 PM - Sahil Garg: Yes, basically in web dev back end
6/27/18, 2:04 PM - Sahil Garg: you can do in php
6/27/18, 2:04 PM - Sahil Garg: Or even python
6/27/18, 2:04 PM - Sahil Garg: Or js
6/27/18, 2:04 PM - Sahil Garg: It's just a choice
6/27/18, 2:04 PM - Sahil Garg: And depends on which api or library is available in which language
6/27/18, 2:09 PM - Jenit Jain: So I do just flask also is there a disadvantage? Because my colleague was telling me that if the traffic is going to be heavy then people prefer node js
6/27/18, 2:11 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah that's there
6/27/18, 2:11 PM - Sahil Garg: Cause node js is the latest
6/27/18, 2:11 PM - Sahil Garg: And it's again what I told you
6/27/18, 2:11 PM - Sahil Garg: For hybrid right
6/27/18, 2:11 PM - Sahil Garg: So hybrid means web also along with all mobile platforms
6/27/18, 2:11 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah flask or django is pretty beneficial
6/27/18, 2:12 PM - Sahil Garg: Especially cause you already have python knowledge
6/27/18, 2:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Django is python too?
6/27/18, 2:20 PM - Jenit Jain: After reading a bit, I'm confused between node.js, flask and Django, could you suggest one
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: Yup
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: Do you know JavaScript already
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: *?
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Nope
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: If you've used js then you can learn node
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: Otherwise I think flask is really good
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: You can do everything in it
6/27/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: Django is getting a bit older
6/27/18, 2:39 PM - Sahil Garg: Then flask only seems good
6/27/18, 2:40 PM - Jenit Jain: What about the traffic issue. How disadvantageous is it
6/27/18, 3:23 PM - Sahil Garg: I think it's fine, not such a big issue for scalability
6/27/18, 3:23 PM - Sahil Garg: Node js is better with that aspect
6/27/18, 3:23 PM - Sahil Garg: But really doesn't affect so much
6/27/18, 3:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Probably won't become an engineer without you man
6/27/18, 3:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Thankssss
6/27/18, 3:28 PM - Sahil Garg: Balls bro üòÇüòÇüòÇ

6/27/18, 3:50 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not so sure myself
6/27/18, 3:50 PM - Sahil Garg: But I think competitive itself

8/26/18, 11:53 AM - Sahil Garg: Haha no you can't
8/26/18, 11:53 AM - Jenit Jain: not even for the small dataset>
8/26/18, 11:53 AM - Jenit Jain: ?
8/26/18, 11:54 AM - Sahil Garg: Small you can
8/26/18, 11:55 AM - Jenit Jain: my large timer expired before i texted you, it is still reading the input üòÇ
8/26/18, 11:55 AM - Sahil Garg: XD
8/26/18, 11:55 AM - Sahil Garg: Which question?
8/26/18, 11:55 AM - Sahil Garg: A?
8/26/18, 11:57 AM - Jenit Jain: yes
8/26/18, 12:04 PM - Sahil Garg: nice

8/26/18, 12:06 PM - Sahil Garg: im trying A large now
8/26/18, 12:11 PM - Sahil Garg: whats your logic
8/26/18, 12:11 PM - Sahil Garg: does it work for k>1?
8/26/18, 12:13 PM - Jenit Jain: input A, sort it, in every iter remove k elements from the start, then decrements all elements and then remove all elements (from the start) that have the value 0 (meaning the yoghurts that have expired)
8/26/18, 12:13 PM - Jenit Jain: i could have saved a lot of space while executing it if i didnt use so many loops but eh
8/26/18, 12:16 PM - Sahil Garg: alright alright
8/26/18, 12:16 PM - Sahil Garg: should work for k > 1
8/26/18, 12:17 PM - Sahil Garg: but itll be too slow :P
8/26/18, 12:31 PM - Sahil Garg: I completed A small and large but cant get to know score of large yet
8/26/18, 12:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Nice
8/26/18, 12:37 PM - Sahil Garg: did you get yours to work?
8/26/18, 1:53 PM - Jenit Jain: How many you go bro
8/26/18, 1:53 PM - Jenit Jain: And the large problem?
8/26/18, 1:54 PM - Sahil Garg: Second small
8/26/18, 1:54 PM - Sahil Garg: Large they'll tell after contest ends, for how much score
8/26/18, 1:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha
8/26/18, 1:59 PM - Jenit Jain: I just finished my second small
8/26/18, 2:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Can you please email me the output file and the dataset file for it. So at least I can get some self satisfaction
8/26/18, 2:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Whenever you're free
8/26/18, 3:27 PM - Jenit Jain: And what did you use instead of this
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Sahil Garg: I don't have the second ones output, it got overwritten and I deleted the code xD
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Sahil Garg: I have the dataset
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Sahil Garg: I'll send whatever I have to you
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Sahil Garg: Basically another counter that stores the current day that you're processing for
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Sahil Garg: I can send you the code for 1st one
8/26/18, 3:30 PM - Sahil Garg: I think I haven't deleted that
8/26/18, 3:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha send this at least
8/26/18, 3:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha is this because deleting an element will take extra time?
8/26/18, 3:35 PM - Sahil Garg: No you wouldn't need to then go across the rest of the array to decrement their values
8/26/18, 3:35 PM - Sahil Garg: Sending
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: all this is for the first one
8/26/18, 3:38 PM - Sahil Garg: my small and large dataset passed
8/26/18, 3:40 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 3:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Noicee
8/26/18, 3:40 PM - Sahil Garg: this is for B
8/26/18, 3:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Ha needed this only
8/26/18, 3:41 PM - Jenit Jain: B large toh won't even see
8/26/18, 3:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Lol
8/26/18, 3:41 PM - Sahil Garg: peacee
8/26/18, 3:41 PM - Sahil Garg: xD
8/26/18, 3:42 PM - Sahil Garg: B one is hard
8/26/18, 3:42 PM - Sahil Garg: you did count of each bit with 1s and 0s? and found for each bit, which is better ?
8/26/18, 3:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes. So basically Max of each of the P columns, but then if this value was in the forbidden list, then would change the combination one by one. Like in the first case it was 1000 which was forbidden, so I did 0000,1100,1010,1001. Something like thag
8/26/18, 3:45 PM - Jenit Jain: So it's still better than O(2^n)
8/26/18, 3:45 PM - Jenit Jain: But I couldn't submit my solution so let's see
8/26/18, 3:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Altogyher how many points did you get
8/26/18, 3:46 PM - Sahil Garg: 30
8/26/18, 3:46 PM - Sahil Garg: Understood I did the same thing
8/26/18, 8:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Is the entire transport layer coming?
8/26/18, 11:02 PM - Sahil Garg: For CN sessional?
8/26/18, 11:02 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not sure really, I think only half of it
8/27/18, 8:38 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
8/27/18, 8:38 PM - Sahil Garg: This is for A? üßê
8/27/18, 8:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Ha
8/27/18, 8:39 PM - Sahil Garg: Damnnnn
8/27/18, 8:39 PM - Sahil Garg: Bro try B Large dataset it'll take some 10 days üòÇüòÇüòÇ
8/27/18, 8:50 PM - Jenit Jain: fucking strings
8/27/18, 8:51 PM - Jenit Jain: I'd rather study OS haha
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Sahil Garg: üòÇüòÇ
8/27/18, 9:00 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah lol
8/27/18, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Do you have it?
8/27/18, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: My small things compiles pretty fast so let's see
8/27/18, 10:29 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah I think so
8/27/18, 10:29 PM - Sahil Garg: Haha, you got correct for the first part of B?
8/27/18, 10:31 PM - Jenit Jain: There are no errors but I don't have anything to compare it with because you sent the outputs for only the the A Problems
8/27/18, 10:31 PM - Sahil Garg: Dude you can still submit it on the same link and check
8/27/18, 10:32 PM - Sahil Garg: If it shows correct or not
8/31/18, 7:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro are you doing the different formats of the IEEE SRSs
8/31/18, 7:27 PM - Sahil Garg: Not really, just read through it once
8/31/18, 7:28 PM - Jenit Jain: Alrightt
9/1/18, 12:23 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
9/1/18, 12:23 PM - Sahil Garg: What's the third Mcq in this?
9/1/18, 12:26 PM - Jenit Jain: External interfaces I think
9/1/18, 12:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh fuck you called. Sorry I thought it was spam
9/1/18, 12:27 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah it's chill üòÇ
9/1/18, 12:27 PM - Sahil Garg: Thanks for saving my number bruh xD
9/1/18, 12:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Mostly this only
9/1/18, 12:27 PM - Sahil Garg: Isn't this there in the srs ?
9/1/18, 12:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Your whatsapp number is different fuck you
9/1/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
9/1/18, 12:28 PM - Jenit Jain: All the answers are there
9/1/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: I think it's either maintainability
9/1/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: Or goals
9/1/18, 12:28 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh damn
9/1/18, 12:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Actually no it won't be external interfaces
9/1/18, 12:29 PM - Jenit Jain: It's goals then
9/1/18, 12:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Because implementatiom starts from design
9/1/18, 12:29 PM - Sahil Garg: Even I think so
9/1/18, 12:30 PM - Sahil Garg: What's maintainability?
9/1/18, 12:30 PM - Sahil Garg: Where does that come?
9/1/18, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Non functional req
9/1/18, 12:30 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah, are these there in srs?
9/1/18, 12:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Yep
9/1/18, 12:31 PM - Sahil Garg: Then it's goals only
9/5/18, 7:49 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro send the daytime server code na please
9/5/18, 8:17 AM - Sahil Garg: Broo take it in class no, I'll bring it?

9/24/18, 3:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro can you tell me what is the SE portion and where to study from? I'm completely clueless
9/24/18, 4:39 PM - Sahil Garg: It's from design analysis
9/24/18, 4:39 PM - Sahil Garg: To dfd disgrams
9/24/18, 4:39 PM - Sahil Garg: *diagrams
9/24/18, 4:40 PM - Sahil Garg: Lecture 12 to 16 in the course plan,
9/24/18, 4:40 PM - Sahil Garg: Everything is in the slides, so you can read that
9/24/18, 5:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Dfds a lot of out of portion is coming right
9/24/18, 6:07 PM - Sahil Garg: Like you just need to know how to draw one, basic notations
9/24/18, 6:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Send me notes? :)
9/24/18, 6:46 PM - Sahil Garg: Bro it's in slides and there's a doc, it's in the cse d group
9/24/18, 6:46 PM - Sahil Garg: If you don't get, I'll send
9/24/18, 6:59 PM - Sahil Garg: https://nptel.ac.in/courses/Webcourse-contents/IIT%20Kharagpur/Soft%20Engg/pdf/m05L10.pdf
9/24/18, 7:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanksss
10/2/18, 1:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro
10/2/18, 1:07 PM - Jenit Jain: You participating in tech tatva
10/2/18, 1:59 PM - Sahil Garg: Yea maybe
10/2/18, 1:59 PM - Sahil Garg: Not sure yet
10/2/18, 1:59 PM - Sahil Garg: Why what happened
10/2/18, 2:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Wanna participate in any team one? Incase ananya isn't taking part
10/2/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: Ananya also will be taking part only mostly bro
10/2/18, 2:38 PM - Sahil Garg: I'll tell you after asking her once
10/2/18, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Yass
10/3/18, 4:53 PM - Jenit Jain: You doing the cryptoss hackerrank?
10/3/18, 5:31 PM - Sahil Garg: Nope haven't seen it yet
10/7/18, 6:27 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
10/7/18, 6:29 PM - Sahil Garg: I think it should be >=
10/7/18, 6:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Why not >
10/7/18, 6:31 PM - Jenit Jain: When it is 0, doesn't it mean that there are no instance and no processes waiting in the queue
10/7/18, 6:31 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not sure, I haven't done it yet
10/7/18, 6:32 PM - Sahil Garg: I'll check and tell you
10/7/18, 6:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Thankss
10/7/18, 11:52 PM - Sahil Garg: This is correct bro, basically you add a process to s->list only when your value is less than 0, because then that process can't get resource at same time and needs to wait in a queue
10/7/18, 11:53 PM - Sahil Garg: So when you signal(), you must remove processes from list when value is <= 0, so that all processes added to list can be restored as and when a process gives away a resource
10/7/18, 11:56 PM - Jenit Jain: üî•üî•üî•
10/7/18, 11:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Mvp

10/10/18, 11:31 AM - Sahil Garg: He's sent the slides for everything he does in class
10/10/18, 11:31 AM - Sahil Garg: And there are like a few 8-9 page notes on the class group Vasvi has sent
10/10/18, 11:32 AM - Sahil Garg: You'll have to read all of those
10/10/18, 11:32 AM - Sahil Garg: That's enough I think
10/10/18, 11:39 AM - Jenit Jain: Text book?
10/10/18, 11:58 AM - Sahil Garg: I think slides has everything
10/10/18, 11:58 AM - Jenit Jain: The normal design phase one only right?

10/10/18, 12:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
10/11/18, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
10/11/18, 9:05 PM - Sahil Garg: It's the Elliac network
10/11/18, 9:05 PM - Sahil Garg: Cause in the elliac 4 mesh network, one pe is connected to 4 other pes
10/11/18, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: And N?
10/11/18, 9:07 PM - Sahil Garg: I think you can take anything in that range xD
10/11/18, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Chal thanks
10/11/18, 9:08 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not sure of N
10/11/18, 9:08 PM - Sahil Garg: Tell me if you find out
10/11/18, 9:09 PM - Jenit Jain: N=25
10/11/18, 9:09 PM - Sahil Garg: Why?
10/11/18, 9:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Only perfect square in that range so
10/11/18, 9:09 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh r = root N
10/11/18, 9:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Ha
10/11/18, 9:13 PM - Sahil Garg: Thanks

10/16/18, 4:49 PM - Sahil Garg: 14 bro
10/16/18, 4:49 PM - Sahil Garg: She cut randomly
10/16/18, 4:49 PM - Sahil Garg: But it's based on their answer key
10/16/18, 4:49 PM - Sahil Garg: And you have to write all the points
10/16/18, 4:50 PM - Jenit Jain: They were strict about the theory?
10/16/18, 4:55 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah a little
10/22/18, 12:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro do you know the lab test schedule for this wrrk
10/22/18, 12:09 PM - Sahil Garg: Wednesday algo lab
10/22/18, 12:09 PM - Sahil Garg: Friday OS lab
10/22/18, 12:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Cn is over na?
10/22/18, 12:11 PM - Jenit Jain: From which lab to which lab in those 2
10/22/18, 12:11 PM - Sahil Garg: I think one more will happen
10/22/18, 12:11 PM - Sahil Garg: Not sure of this
10/22/18, 12:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanksd
10/24/18, 5:57 AM - Jenit Jain: For Algo we have lab 7 8 9 only right
10/24/18, 8:10 AM - Sahil Garg: Dayumm you woke up early
10/25/18, 8:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro how is 
turnaround time = end time - start time + waiting time
10/25/18, 8:26 PM - Jenit Jain: In scheduling algorithms part
10/25/18, 8:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Shouldnt it be 
turnaround time = end time - start time
10/25/18, 8:29 PM - Sahil Garg: It's this only bro
10/25/18, 8:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Can you send the output of your lab 6 question 1i
10/25/18, 8:38 PM - Sahil Garg: Gimme a while I'm out
10/25/18, 8:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah thanks man

10/26/18, 12:02 AM - Sahil Garg: Lab 6 output
10/26/18, 12:03 AM - Jenit Jain: Exactly so see the turnaround time
10/26/18, 12:03 AM - Jenit Jain: It's not end - start
10/26/18, 12:03 AM - Jenit Jain: It is end - arrival
10/26/18, 12:04 AM - Sahil Garg: Yes it's this
10/26/18, 12:04 AM - Sahil Garg: This is the definition of turn around time
10/26/18, 12:04 AM - Jenit Jain: Alright thanks :)
10/28/18, 3:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Do we have hamming distance and the parity thing that's follows?
10/28/18, 3:54 PM - Sahil Garg: nopee
10/28/18, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: So for error detection only till codewords and datawords a d then directly the dlc protocols!
10/28/18, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: ?*
10/28/18, 3:56 PM - Sahil Garg: yup I guess
10/28/18, 3:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Alright

10/30/18, 11:06 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
10/30/18, 11:08 PM - Sahil Garg: Which PC is x.com?
10/30/18, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: No, x.com is stored on the DNS server na
10/30/18, 11:09 PM - Sahil Garg: Then everything can ping it
10/30/18, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: From dns client to x.com is workingn
10/30/18, 11:10 PM - Jenit Jain: But pinging is not working from any of the pcs to x.com
10/30/18, 11:10 PM - Jenit Jain: The gateway from pc1 and PC2 will be 10.0.0.1 and 30.0.0.1 respectively right?
10/30/18, 11:14 PM - Sahil Garg: Yupp
10/30/18, 11:14 PM - Sahil Garg: That's fine
10/30/18, 11:18 PM - Jenit Jain: So to configure pc1 will we have to do ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.2?
10/30/18, 11:22 PM - Sahil Garg: Yupp this ip route in the left router
10/30/18, 11:23 PM - Jenit Jain: Thank you
10/30/18, 11:23 PM - Jenit Jain: Are you doing the select methodüòÇ
10/30/18, 11:27 PM - Sahil Garg: No bro
10/30/18, 11:27 PM - Sahil Garg: It's too long üòÇüòÇ
10/31/18, 8:24 AM - Jenit Jain: Yo
In a DHCP when you have assignment 128 address block and a 64 address block the mask for the network's are
255.255.255.128
255.255.255.192
What will be there addresses when we have allocate first 64 and then 128
10/31/18, 9:03 AM - Sahil Garg: The reverse of the two network masks
10/31/18, 9:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Won't then 192 addresses be allocated to the first block
10/31/18, 10:31 AM - Jenit Jain: How do you connect one router to 2 routersnsuch that both can be used for dns query
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Sahil Garg: Change settings in router
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Sahil Garg: For many fast Ethernet
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Sahil Garg: Or just connect via normal serial connection also
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Sahil Garg: That also works
10/31/18, 11:00 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm talking about the setting it up part
10/31/18, 11:04 AM - Sahil Garg: The commands?
10/31/18, 11:05 AM - Sahil Garg: Domain lookup and name server command
10/31/18, 11:05 AM - Sahil Garg: And ip dns Command
10/31/18, 4:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro what was the ttl and data length when you ping google.com

11/18/18, 8:50 AM - Jenit Jain: Particularly for reservation tables, dependencies part (examples of data depencies and control dependencies)
11/18/18, 9:02 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah this I saw üòÇüòÇ
11/18/18, 9:02 AM - Sahil Garg: Cool cool
11/18/18, 10:26 AM - Jenit Jain: Thank you
11/18/18, 11:57 AM - Jenit Jain: Also can you send the formulas for the number of pes connected to 1 pe I various network's (mesh,Omega etc)
11/18/18, 11:59 AM - Sahil Garg: For barrel shifter it's 2n-1
11/18/18, 11:59 AM - Sahil Garg: For illiac mesh network it's 4
11/18/18, 12:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Nothing else na?
11/18/18, 12:14 PM - Sahil Garg: Nope
11/18/18, 7:51 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>

11/18/18, 8:03 PM - Sahil Garg: You?
11/18/18, 8:04 PM - Jenit Jain: I started couple of days back so im Done kabka.
11/18/18, 8:04 PM - Jenit Jain: Scared that I'm finished so quickly
11/18/18, 8:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Friend told me mesi protocol and clusters they're gonna ask for sure
11/18/18, 8:06 PM - Sahil Garg: Maddd
11/18/18, 8:06 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh damn yeah mesi seems like it'll come
11/18/18, 8:06 PM - Sahil Garg: For clusters I don't know
11/18/18, 8:06 PM - Sahil Garg: She didn't even do it in our class
11/18/18, 10:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Lol
11/18/18, 10:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Broo
11/18/18, 10:55 PM - Jenit Jain: In the assignment where you had to add 10 numbers with 8 Pes
11/18/18, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: You put the 1st two and the last two elements in the 1st two pes
11/18/18, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: In the first step, only the first 2 pes are active for the addition operation and the rest are masked off
11/18/18, 10:57 PM - Sahil Garg: 16 numbers and 8 pes
11/18/18, 10:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Then the addition from A + B regs is put in R0 and R1 respectively
11/18/18, 10:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah okay then all pes will be active
11/18/18, 10:57 PM - Jenit Jain: But the same method right
11/18/18, 10:57 PM - Sahil Garg: Yupp
11/18/18, 10:58 PM - Sahil Garg: Yess
11/18/18, 11:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Thankss
11/18/18, 11:08 PM - Sahil Garg: Peace
11/18/18, 11:08 PM - Sahil Garg: ‚úåüèª
11/21/18, 9:08 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
11/21/18, 9:08 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
11/21/18, 9:08 AM - Jenit Jain: All the sequence numbers are correct only rightn
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Sahil Garg: All correct
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Sahil Garg: Yupp all correct
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Jenit Jain: Some are saying that last ack has to be 8000
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Jenit Jain: And last ack has to be x
11/21/18, 9:16 AM - Sahil Garg: No I think this is correct only
11/21/18, 9:16 AM - Sahil Garg: Both diagrams
11/21/18, 9:16 AM - Sahil Garg: Why would it be 8000?
11/21/18, 9:18 AM - Jenit Jain: Because ack doesn't consume right
11/21/18, 9:20 AM - Sahil Garg: For which one?
11/21/18, 9:21 AM - Sahil Garg: Oh yeah if there's no data it'll continue to be 8000
11/21/18, 9:21 AM - Jenit Jain: So which one is wrong
11/21/18, 9:29 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay so the correct values are 8001 and x
11/21/18, 9:29 AM - Jenit Jain: 8000 is incremented because the ack uses the 8001
11/21/18, 9:29 AM - Jenit Jain: And the first data also uses 8001
11/21/18, 9:30 AM - Jenit Jain: X is not incremented because there will be no segment that can use x as a seq number as the connection is being terminated
11/21/18, 9:30 AM - Jenit Jain: So no sense making it x+1
11/21/18, 9:30 AM - Jenit Jain: This is what sir said
11/21/18, 9:37 AM - Sahil Garg: Ohh cool, so that's x
11/21/18, 9:39 AM - Sahil Garg: But ack doesn't consume an ack right ? So it should be 8000 only ?
11/21/18, 9:41 AM - Jenit Jain: 8001 is overlapped between ack and the first data seg
11/21/18, 9:41 AM - Jenit Jain: So it's allowed
11/21/18, 9:42 AM - Jenit Jain: If you use x+1, it will be waste because it is only for ack and it isn't shared by some data seg
11/21/18, 9:42 AM - Jenit Jain: Hence incrementing it isa waste
11/21/18, 9:42 AM - Jenit Jain: That's all I have understood lol
11/21/18, 9:44 AM - Sahil Garg: Ohh cool cool
11/21/18, 9:44 AM - Sahil Garg: If there's no data and this logic applies, it should be 8000 only
11/21/18, 9:45 AM - Jenit Jain: Yep
11/22/18, 7:34 PM - Jenit Jain: How to se bro
11/22/18, 7:34 PM - Jenit Jain: What all are you doing

1/23/19, 11:31 AM - Sahil Garg: Dear All,

As part of PCAP lab work, you need to search for a problem from Science or Mathematics or Engineering and implement a parallel solution to it in MPI+OpenCL or MPI+CUDA.

Batch 1 - submission date 29th Jan 2019
Batch 2 - submission date 24th Jan 2019

I have already mailed the synopsis format. You can search in the library portal for a paper.

2/21/19, 10:36 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not sure bro, Yes I think that project is perfect ? Just gotta make the abstract if we have to submit
2/21/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Vasvi said only grammar
2/21/19, 10:39 PM - Sahil Garg: And regular expressions also she had said in class

2/21/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay so should I copy down everything on paper
2/21/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: And then write our names
2/21/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: And the language is erplang right?
2/21/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: We'll have to change that right
2/21/19, 10:50 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not sure if we have to submit a handwritten copy or a printed doc
2/21/19, 10:50 PM - Sahil Garg: It's better if we confirm with her first
2/21/19, 10:50 PM - Sahil Garg: Nope we finalised that bits one right ?
2/21/19, 10:53 PM - Jenit Jain: But it's not a made up language right.
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Or was it made up by the creator
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Sahil Garg: it isn't necessary to do it on a made up language
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Sahil Garg: you can do it for anything
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh okayy
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Then chill
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Sahil Garg: its a language bits uses to teach their compiler design course so its chill
2/21/19, 10:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Can you do the texting. She's already pretty pissed at me
2/21/19, 10:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh right yeah
2/21/19, 10:56 PM - Sahil Garg: yes I will bro, no issues
2/21/19, 10:56 PM - Sahil Garg: I will check with her and tell you
2/21/19, 10:57 PM - Sahil Garg: lets just compile the stuff that we will put in the abstracy
2/21/19, 10:57 PM - Sahil Garg: then either write it or put it in a doc and print it
2/22/19, 4:15 PM - Jenit Jain: What did CD ma'am say
2/22/19, 4:16 PM - Sahil Garg: I called her just now bro
2/22/19, 4:16 PM - Sahil Garg: It's not today

2/22/19, 4:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Sort I'll print it out
2/22/19, 4:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Where to write the nane
2/22/19, 4:19 PM - Sahil Garg: Add it in the doc itself on last page ?
2/22/19, 4:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Or first
2/22/19, 4:20 PM - Sahil Garg: First is also chill
2/22/19, 4:20 PM - Sahil Garg: Do it on first
2/23/19, 5:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro can you explain me what you used flex for in the symbol table program
2/23/19, 5:55 PM - Jenit Jain: And what part you implemented using normal C
2/23/19, 7:39 PM - Sahil Garg: Everything in c
2/23/19, 7:39 PM - Sahil Garg: No flex
2/23/19, 7:45 PM - Jenit Jain: She told me to include flex some how in the symbol table code
2/23/19, 7:45 PM - Jenit Jain: What's that for
2/23/19, 9:36 PM - Sahil Garg: So symbol table is for only function names and identifiers right ?
2/23/19, 9:36 PM - Sahil Garg: Everything else like operators and symbols and stuff just print with flex
2/23/19, 9:36 PM - Sahil Garg: And for this use c code as header file and call its function
2/23/19, 9:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Functions to basically add an entry in the table right?
2/23/19, 9:49 PM - Sahil Garg: Yupp
2/27/19, 11:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro send me the sample input program that was used for the symbol table output (that day where they checked everyone's code)
2/27/19, 11:06 AM - Jenit Jain: And send the project file as well
2/27/19, 11:06 AM - Jenit Jain: I'll get it verified

3/25/19, 8:22 PM - Jenit Jain: bro can you send the latest lab codes for both the labs
3/25/19, 8:25 PM - Sahil Garg: done
3/25/19, 8:27 PM - Jenit Jain: and on Wednesday when we meet in class, can i please xerox the latest stuff from pcap and cd theory. I dont know when my resessionals are so need to be prepared lol.
3/25/19, 8:28 PM - Sahil Garg: cool
3/25/19, 8:29 PM - Jenit Jain: thank youuu
3/25/19, 8:29 PM - Sahil Garg: ü§üüèª
4/1/19, 9:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Be
4/1/19, 9:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro
4/1/19, 9:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Remember that rowsum of the preceding rows of a matrix in mpi
4/1/19, 9:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Lab 3
4/1/19, 9:03 AM - Jenit Jain: Basically you send 1 row to every process and then do mpi_scan
4/1/19, 9:14 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah?
4/1/19, 10:57 AM - Jenit Jain: What if we have to do colsum of the preceding columns
4/1/19, 10:57 AM - Jenit Jain: How would you do this with MPI collective communication
4/1/19, 11:25 AM - Sahil Garg: Transpose the matrix and then do the same thing ?
4/1/19, 11:27 AM - Jenit Jain: Thanks for making me feel dumb
4/1/19, 11:33 AM - Sahil Garg: Lol I'm asking if that's fine ? It should work right ?
4/1/19, 11:37 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes
4/1/19, 11:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Transpose, same thing, then transpose again
4/1/19, 11:41 AM - Sahil Garg: Yes that should be it
4/1/19, 11:46 AM - Sahil Garg: How do you transpose a matrix using collective communication ?
4/1/19, 11:50 AM - Jenit Jain: Send a row to each process then all to all
4/1/19, 11:52 AM - Sahil Garg: Send row using scatter ?
4/1/19, 11:53 AM - Sahil Garg: How will all to all do transpose ? You'll get same matrix back right ?
4/1/19, 11:54 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes
4/1/19, 11:54 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/1/19, 11:55 AM - Sahil Garg: Thanks where is this ?
4/1/19, 11:55 AM - Sahil Garg: And after all to all you have to do gather again ?
4/1/19, 11:58 AM - Jenit Jain: Not needed, the process can directly print the row. Or you can gather and then print after 
If r==0
4/1/19, 11:58 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/1/19, 11:59 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah got it, like if you want the matrix back in process 0 then you'll need to gather it back was my question
4/1/19, 11:59 AM - Sahil Garg: Thanks bro
4/1/19, 11:59 AM - Jenit Jain: Thank *you* üòÇ
4/1/19, 12:00 PM - Sahil Garg: Haha üòÇ
4/2/19, 4:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro how did you send the elements
4/2/19, 4:15 PM - Sahil Garg: using MPI_Send
4/2/19, 4:15 PM - Sahil Garg: point to point
4/2/19, 4:28 PM - Jenit Jain: man fucking this shit didnt work
4/2/19, 4:28 PM - Jenit Jain: lets say you want to sen 5th element, so first parameter will be a[5] or &a[5]
4/2/19, 4:29 PM - Sahil Garg: &a[5[
4/2/19, 4:29 PM - Jenit Jain: accha thanks
4/2/19, 4:30 PM - Sahil Garg: you didnt put that?
4/2/19, 4:30 PM - Jenit Jain: i did. still my send calls werent workong
4/2/19, 4:30 PM - Sahil Garg: no idea bro
4/2/19, 4:30 PM - Sahil Garg: yours didnt work?
4/2/19, 4:31 PM - Jenit Jain: what if you send the same tags(0-3) but with different destn address, is that a problem
4/2/19, 4:31 PM - Jenit Jain: barely
4/2/19, 4:31 PM - Jenit Jain: it read the i/p and then hangs
4/2/19, 4:32 PM - Sahil Garg: nope
4/2/19, 4:32 PM - Sahil Garg: damn so he marked ticks for what all?
4/2/19, 4:33 PM - Jenit Jain: too many time ive heard this this sem
4/2/19, 4:33 PM - Jenit Jain: idk broüòÇ
4/2/19, 4:33 PM - Jenit Jain: this sem is over for me
4/2/19, 4:34 PM - Sahil Garg: haha lol
4/2/19, 4:34 PM - Sahil Garg: itll be okay bro dont worry
4/2/19, 4:34 PM - Sahil Garg: how many people got it working?
4/2/19, 4:34 PM - Jenit Jain: quite a few actualy
4/2/19, 4:34 PM - Jenit Jain: lets see mamn
4/2/19, 4:35 PM - Jenit Jain: tomorrow what time are we meeting for the project
4/2/19, 4:35 PM - Sahil Garg: tomorrow morning lets do
4/2/19, 4:35 PM - Sahil Garg: what time is best for you?
4/2/19, 4:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Let's do as early as
4/2/19, 4:52 PM - Jenit Jain: I have an exam day after so must study
4/2/19, 4:54 PM - Sahil Garg: say the time bob, ill be up for it
4/2/19, 4:54 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/2/19, 4:54 PM - Sahil Garg: after 8 though
4/2/19, 4:54 PM - Jenit Jain: We'll ask on the group
4/2/19, 4:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro just see if there's something wrong in sending and receiving
4/2/19, 5:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck bro
4/2/19, 5:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Stupid mistake got or
4/2/19, 5:14 PM - Jenit Jain: it*
4/2/19, 8:06 PM - Sahil Garg: I was in Italian class bro sorry
4/2/19, 8:07 PM - Sahil Garg: Let's do that
4/2/19, 8:07 PM - Sahil Garg: What was it ? :o
4/2/19, 8:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro I was sending from 0 to all including 0 but there is more recv for process 0 so it hangs
4/2/19, 8:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Fucking 4 more lines of code.
4/2/19, 8:15 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh
4/2/19, 8:15 PM - Sahil Garg: You didn't have to send from 0 to 0
4/2/19, 8:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes I added that to my come after coming home
4/2/19, 8:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Loll
4/2/19, 8:17 PM - Sahil Garg: Lol
4/4/19, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
4/4/19, 9:33 PM - Jenit Jain: bro your part of the code is forming the token list right?
4/4/19, 9:33 PM - Jenit Jain: tokenInfo struct one
4/4/19, 10:37 PM - Sahil Garg: Yes it is I think I'm still not thorough bro I'll start now properly I had oe from 5 to 8
4/4/19, 10:43 PM - Jenit Jain: yeah yeah its chill. just let me know before lab
4/4/19, 10:43 PM - Jenit Jain: also when im done with my code, i'll send the updated .c file. i have added comments for tomorrow in case i fuck up lol
4/4/19, 10:46 PM - Sahil Garg: Give me 1 hour or so
4/4/19, 10:46 PM - Sahil Garg: Peaceful lol
4/4/19, 10:46 PM - Jenit Jain: yeah yeah i just want the meaning of the returned values
4/5/19, 7:23 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro when S0 doesn't contain all items, it doesn't affect the closure of other items sets right?
4/5/19, 7:23 PM - Jenit Jain: Like closure we add from the og grammar only right
4/5/19, 7:23 PM - Sahil Garg: No it doesn't
4/5/19, 7:24 PM - Jenit Jain: üëçüèª
4/7/19, 3:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro Pcap your notes are enough for sessional 2 or are there more things in the text theory wise
4/7/19, 4:57 PM - Sahil Garg: I did just that
4/7/19, 5:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Best
4/7/19, 5:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Also can either of the 2 assignments be conducted tomorrow?
4/7/19, 5:52 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm not sure bro
4/7/19, 5:52 PM - Sahil Garg: Haven't said anything
4/7/19, 6:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Let me know if you find out please
4/7/19, 7:42 PM - Sahil Garg: Sure bro
4/7/19, 7:42 PM - Sahil Garg: Nothing yet
4/8/19, 7:57 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/8/19, 9:09 AM - Sahil Garg: üòÇüòÇ
4/8/19, 9:09 AM - Sahil Garg: Lol too much difference between sending a mail and having a log xD
4/11/19, 9:40 PM - Jenit Jain: bro can you please send cd lab 2 code
4/11/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: basically how do you get tokens without using spaces
4/11/19, 10:42 PM - Sahil Garg: If it's not an alnum or not underscore then generate the token
4/11/19, 10:42 PM - Sahil Garg: Instead of at getting space
4/11/19, 10:44 PM - Jenit Jain: And also if there is a space or a new line right
4/11/19, 10:44 PM - Sahil Garg: That'll be automatically included in else
4/11/19, 10:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay okay
4/11/19, 10:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro if there are key points to definitely remember coding wise like this please tell
4/11/19, 10:47 PM - Jenit Jain: I just started I'm fucked manüò≠
4/11/19, 10:54 PM - Sahil Garg: Haha bro it's chill it's not so much, the main issue is C Code just randomly doesn't work lol
4/11/19, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha alright I'll try
4/11/19, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Thank you
4/12/19, 5:36 AM - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
4/12/19, 10:32 AM - Jenit Jain: BROOO
4/12/19, 10:33 AM - Jenit Jain: YOU SAVED MY ASS
4/12/19, 10:33 AM - Jenit Jain: Must appreciate
4/12/19, 10:33 AM - Jenit Jain: Thank you
4/12/19, 10:59 AM - Sahil Garg: Haha it's chill
4/12/19, 10:59 AM - Sahil Garg: Yours worked fully ?
4/12/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: I didn't include the case to allow c as an ID but except that yes
4/12/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Yours?
4/12/19, 11:02 AM - Sahil Garg: Yes same
4/12/19, 11:02 AM - Sahil Garg: You think they'll cut for that?
4/12/19, 11:02 AM - Sahil Garg: Other sections didn't even have a check for this
4/12/19, 11:02 AM - Sahil Garg: The c was a keyword for me
4/12/19, 11:03 AM - Sahil Garg: Everything else was chill
4/12/19, 11:10 AM - Jenit Jain: Depends on if that 1 mother fucker implemented it
4/12/19, 11:11 AM - Jenit Jain: Same
4/12/19, 11:11 AM - Jenit Jain: But truly, thank you
4/12/19, 11:14 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah Krishna Birla did it
4/12/19, 11:15 AM - Sahil Garg: Haha it's chill man ü§üüèª
4/12/19, 11:17 AM - Jenit Jain: Madarchod
4/12/19, 11:20 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah it's fine
4/12/19, 11:20 AM - Sahil Garg: How much do you think they'll cut for that
4/12/19, 11:20 AM - Sahil Garg: Out of 25?
4/12/19, 11:38 AM - Jenit Jain: 2-3?
4/12/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah I guess
4/12/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: Or maybe even lesser right ?
4/12/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: It was a small thing only right ?
4/12/19, 11:44 AM - Jenit Jain: Bhai Tera A* ayega chill Kar üòÇ
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: Is that an A
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: Or an A+
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: :P
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Jenit Jain: üôÑüôÑ
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Jenit Jain: How were your internals tho overall
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: We don't know right ?
4/12/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: It's not uploaded ?
4/12/19, 11:51 AM - Jenit Jain: Yess but I know you know already
4/12/19, 11:52 AM - Sahil Garg: Lol how?
4/12/19, 11:52 AM - Jenit Jain: You're smart man üòÇ what do you expect me to tell you
4/12/19, 11:53 AM - Sahil Garg: Lolol no man I don't know how much they're giving really
4/12/19, 11:53 AM - Sahil Garg: This sem is bad for everyone lol
4/14/19, 8:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro I need help with the MPI part
4/14/19, 8:34 PM - Sahil Garg: What happened bro
4/14/19, 8:44 PM - Jenit Jain: So like what I'm doing is I'm doing the computation part for a single number also using different processes
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Jenit Jain: I didn't change anything yet for a single number all possible grs are getting printed
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Even there no optimal
4/14/19, 8:45 PM - Jenit Jain: And like I can't get the processes to synchronize so the printing is haywire
4/14/19, 8:51 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh can you send the code
4/14/19, 9:16 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/14/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: if you input only 1 number thrn only optimal ones are printed
4/14/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: else everything
4/14/19, 10:54 PM - Sahil Garg: Call bro when you're free
4/14/19, 10:54 PM - Sahil Garg: Let's meet tomorrow ?
4/14/19, 11:06 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll call in a bit
4/14/19, 11:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Not sure
4/14/19, 11:06 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm having the plaster removed and allüî•üî•üî•
4/14/19, 11:10 PM - Sahil Garg: Peace
4/14/19, 11:10 PM - Sahil Garg: One beast onlyyy üòÇ
4/15/19, 8:20 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro
4/15/19, 8:21 AM - Jenit Jain: Sorry I sleptt last night
4/15/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: You call me
4/15/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Let's get done with this mpi
4/15/19, 12:39 PM - Sahil Garg: Cuda and serial is done
4/15/19, 12:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you go through the MPI one
4/15/19, 1:09 PM - Sahil Garg: Calling you
4/15/19, 1:09 PM - Sahil Garg: It's busy
4/15/19, 1:37 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm at the hospital
4/15/19, 1:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Text please
4/15/19, 1:37 PM - Sahil Garg: alright cool
4/15/19, 1:38 PM - Sahil Garg: what are you exactly doing in the MPI code?
4/15/19, 1:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Basically all the values under bestf is being checked to see if it is a ruler
4/15/19, 1:40 PM - Sahil Garg: i didnt understand that boolean code we scammed from online
4/15/19, 1:40 PM - Sahil Garg: i made the serial thing again
4/15/19, 1:40 PM - Sahil Garg: my own code bro
4/15/19, 1:40 PM - Sahil Garg: did you get what they were doing?
4/15/19, 1:40 PM - Jenit Jain: So every process just checks if ruler %s ==r and if it is then it checks whether the ruler is valid
4/15/19, 1:41 PM - Jenit Jain: No bro but I understood the part I had to parallelize
4/15/19, 1:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Then I'll try to implement this
4/15/19, 1:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Since you wrote it it should be clearer
4/15/19, 1:43 PM - Sahil Garg: yupp cool
4/15/19, 1:43 PM - Sahil Garg: when will you be done from the hospital?
4/15/19, 1:43 PM - Sahil Garg: I'll try to get something done in the report till then man
4/15/19, 1:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes try this.
4/15/19, 1:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't know bro but I'll do MPI dw
4/15/19, 1:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Just focus on this
4/15/19, 1:52 PM - Sahil Garg: alright cool
4/15/19, 2:30 PM - Sahil Garg: Bro I haven't really stated.
4/15/19, 2:30 PM - Sahil Garg: Started*
4/15/19, 2:30 PM - Sahil Garg: But I'll finish it today only, don't worry.
4/15/19, 2:30 PM - Sahil Garg: This is amrit bro
4/15/19, 2:30 PM - Sahil Garg: im just gonna do it, he wont do jack
4/15/19, 2:31 PM - Jenit Jain: üôàüôà
4/15/19, 6:10 PM - Jenit Jain: bro
4/15/19, 6:10 PM - Jenit Jain: i dont understand your code
4/15/19, 6:10 PM - Jenit Jain: i dont know what to parallelize using mpi
4/15/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: tell me please
4/15/19, 6:20 PM - Sahil Garg: same thing as Im parallising in cude
4/15/19, 6:20 PM - Sahil Garg: cuda
4/15/19, 6:21 PM - Sahil Garg: let the kernel function be the same
4/15/19, 6:21 PM - Sahil Garg: send 2 values to mpi - which im sending as threadIdx and blockIdx everything else remains same
4/15/19, 6:21 PM - Sahil Garg: and in end get value of r
4/15/19, 6:22 PM - Sahil Garg: which tells if a ruler was found for that k or not
4/15/19, 6:22 PM - Sahil Garg: else k++
4/15/19, 6:22 PM - Sahil Garg: and send to processes again
4/15/19, 6:24 PM - Jenit Jain: so how do i decide how many processes will be there
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Sahil Garg: its a constant
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Sahil Garg: like in my cuda code its 5*24
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Sahil Garg: let it be 120 only
4/15/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: okay
4/15/19, 6:46 PM - Sahil Garg: Did you get ?
4/15/19, 6:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Tbh I'm cluelessüôà
4/15/19, 6:47 PM - Sahil Garg: Okay so see
4/15/19, 6:47 PM - Sahil Garg: every ruler's first element is 0
4/15/19, 7:12 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 7:12 PM - Sahil Garg: run this and try
4/15/19, 7:12 PM - Sahil Garg: give -n 10 and n =4
4/15/19, 7:14 PM - Sahil Garg: give -n = 10 for number of processes and input as a single number
4/15/19, 7:14 PM - Sahil Garg: that single number you run and try 1,2,3,4
4/15/19, 7:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro for pow
4/15/19, 7:15 PM - Jenit Jain: -maths right
4/15/19, 7:16 PM - Sahil Garg: dont need math
4/15/19, 7:16 PM - Sahil Garg: oh we need it yeah
4/15/19, 7:16 PM - Sahil Garg: its -lm
4/15/19, 7:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool
4/15/19, 7:17 PM - Sahil Garg: mpicc mpi.c
4/15/19, 7:17 PM - Sahil Garg: mpiexec -n 10 -lm ./a.out
4/15/19, 7:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah yeah got it
4/15/19, 7:17 PM - Sahil Garg: I think that should do it
4/15/19, 7:17 PM - Jenit Jain: give me 5 I'll tell you
4/15/19, 7:20 PM - Sahil Garg: Line 71 of code is printf("\n%d\n",res);
4/15/19, 7:20 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 7:20 PM - Sahil Garg: instead change it to print tn
4/15/19, 7:21 PM - Sahil Garg: do this and run
4/15/19, 7:21 PM - Sahil Garg: number of processors make it 10
4/15/19, 7:22 PM - Jenit Jain: \n?
4/15/19, 7:22 PM - Sahil Garg: no tn
4/15/19, 7:22 PM - Sahil Garg: tn is a variable name
4/15/19, 7:22 PM - Sahil Garg: printf("\n%d\n",tn);
4/15/19, 7:23 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 7:24 PM - Sahil Garg: Did you try it ?
4/15/19, 7:25 PM - Jenit Jain: There are small errors just fixing that
4/15/19, 7:26 PM - Sahil Garg: cool waiting
4/15/19, 7:29 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 7:30 PM - Sahil Garg: peaceful
4/15/19, 7:30 PM - Sahil Garg: run it with -np as 10 itself
4/15/19, 7:30 PM - Sahil Garg: but give input as 4
4/15/19, 7:30 PM - Jenit Jain: How bro
4/15/19, 7:31 PM - Jenit Jain: See the answer for 2 and 3 and 4
4/15/19, 7:31 PM - Jenit Jain: That's the first ip
4/15/19, 7:31 PM - Sahil Garg: I'll remove the extra output, the final result is 0 which is the final size of ruler
4/15/19, 7:31 PM - Sahil Garg: ohh damn
4/15/19, 7:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Howww
4/15/19, 7:32 PM - Sahil Garg: for n = 1 its coming but nothing else is working
4/15/19, 7:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes
4/15/19, 7:33 PM - Sahil Garg: run this
4/15/19, 7:33 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 7:34 PM - Sahil Garg: same -np 10 and input 4
4/15/19, 7:37 PM - Sahil Garg: tried it ?

4/15/19, 8:07 PM - Sahil Garg: and -np 15 for input 5
4/15/19, 8:07 PM - Jenit Jain: We aren't showing for more than 4?
4/15/19, 8:07 PM - Sahil Garg: and -np 35 for input 6,7,8
4/15/19, 8:08 PM - Sahil Garg: lets see what happens
4/15/19, 8:08 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Sahil Garg: sexy
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Sahil Garg: its showing everything correct
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Sahil Garg: except for 1 its -1
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Where are the optimal rulers
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Sahil Garg: I'll fix that
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Sahil Garg: we aren't printing that
4/15/19, 8:10 PM - Sahil Garg: its fine we're finding it but aren't printing it
4/15/19, 8:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro serial code is printing it so might as well print here too
4/15/19, 8:12 PM - Sahil Garg: it wont bro
4/15/19, 8:12 PM - Jenit Jain: And what are those numbers that are getting printed
4/15/19, 8:12 PM - Sahil Garg: so see the -np youre giving right
4/15/19, 8:12 PM - Sahil Garg: each process will print its ruler
4/15/19, 8:12 PM - Sahil Garg: but we want only optimal one
4/15/19, 8:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes
4/15/19, 8:17 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>

4/15/19, 8:20 PM - Sahil Garg: you wont have to specify
4/15/19, 8:20 PM - Sahil Garg: for mpi it'll run on your comp
4/15/19, 8:20 PM - Sahil Garg: so you do the graph for that
4/15/19, 8:21 PM - Sahil Garg: cuda I'll get from somewhere
4/15/19, 8:22 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 8:24 PM - Sahil Garg: did you run this file?
4/15/19, 8:24 PM - Sahil Garg: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 8:24 PM - Sahil Garg: run this file for n = 1
4/15/19, 8:24 PM - Sahil Garg: and for n = 8 give -np as 40
4/15/19, 8:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro all those are working
4/15/19, 8:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Just running everything to get timings and then graph
4/15/19, 8:37 PM - Sahil Garg: perfect man

4/22/19, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: What will be 1% per months right
4/22/19, 10:58 PM - Sahil Garg: yes thats right
4/22/19, 10:58 PM - Jenit Jain: What are you doing for ratios üôà
4/22/19, 11:03 PM - Sahil Garg: havent started man
4/22/19, 11:03 PM - Sahil Garg: its killing
4/22/19, 11:03 PM - Sahil Garg: no idea how to learn them lol

4/22/19, 11:44 PM - Sahil Garg: thanks man xD
4/24/19, 5:47 PM - Jenit Jain: X -> YZ
Y-> a| epsilon
Z -> b
4/24/19, 5:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Will first(X) contain epsilong
4/24/19, 5:47 PM - Sahil Garg: nope
4/24/19, 5:47 PM - Sahil Garg: just a and b
4/24/19, 5:48 PM - Sahil Garg: if y gives (epsilon) then we get X->Z which is b
4/24/19, 5:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool cool
4/24/19, 5:48 PM - Sahil Garg: thats what i think
4/24/19, 5:48 PM - Sahil Garg: maybe it does have epsilon also along with a and b
4/25/19, 8:40 AM - Jenit Jain: If 2 non terminals that's are not starting symbols are in deadlock while finding the follow set then we just add $ to both of them right?
4/25/19, 9:02 AM - Sahil Garg: Yes
4/25/19, 7:36 PM - Sahil Garg: How was it bro xD
4/25/19, 7:40 PM - Jenit Jain: I wrote semantics rules instead of sdd and the 25 states fuck up and many moreüòÇ
4/25/19, 7:40 PM - Sahil Garg: What ?
4/25/19, 7:40 PM - Sahil Garg: Isn't sdd semantic rules only ?
4/25/19, 7:41 PM - Sahil Garg: Sdd is the table of productions with semantic rules right ?
4/25/19, 7:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you write something like
E.syn = E.inh
Or
E.node = T.node|| '+'
4/25/19, 7:42 PM - Sahil Garg: Both
4/25/19, 7:42 PM - Sahil Garg: Like in the semantic rules both kinda stuff comes
4/25/19, 7:42 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh no node
4/25/19, 7:42 PM - Sahil Garg: It's E.syn = T.val and stuff
4/25/19, 7:42 PM - Jenit Jain: For sure?
4/25/19, 7:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck yeahh
4/25/19, 7:43 PM - Sahil Garg: Yes I wrote that
4/25/19, 7:43 PM - Sahil Garg: That's what they want
4/25/19, 7:43 PM - Sahil Garg: I'm almost fully sure
4/25/19, 7:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Peace mann
4/25/19, 7:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you study pvm stuff btw?
4/25/19, 7:43 PM - Sahil Garg: What were you talking about?
4/25/19, 7:44 PM - Jenit Jain: I also wrote that thing only. I wrote that too
4/25/19, 7:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Sannidhi said node thing is what they wanted
4/25/19, 7:44 PM - Sahil Garg: Then why's it wrong man? :o
4/25/19, 7:45 PM - Jenit Jain: I wrote the inherited synthesized thing
4/25/19, 7:45 PM - Sahil Garg: No man I'll do it in the end
4/25/19, 7:45 PM - Sahil Garg: You started pcap?
4/25/19, 7:45 PM - Sahil Garg: Don't think so man, sdd is semantic rules
4/25/19, 7:45 PM - Sahil Garg: Node thing is construction of syntax tree
4/25/19, 7:47 PM - Jenit Jain: I did it last week so it's fine but the pvm thing is just random unnecessary shit
4/25/19, 7:47 PM - Sahil Garg: Yeah lol i remember he did a little in class
4/25/19, 7:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Stopped attending lectures during my sessional week so all these things are just too new for me haha
4/25/19, 7:49 PM - Sahil Garg: Haha lol it's chill
4/25/19, 8:18 PM - Sahil Garg: I think it's the node() thing
4/25/19, 8:18 PM - Sahil Garg: Saw the question again it says for construction of syntax trees
4/25/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Man
4/26/19, 7:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro can you send the class notes for pvm please

4/27/19, 12:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Exec
4/27/19, 12:22 PM - Sahil Garg: cool
4/28/19, 12:06 PM - Sahil Garg: Bro how was pcap?
4/28/19, 12:28 PM - Jenit Jain: Between 30-35 only. I could write only
4/28/19, 12:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Wasted to much time on the scheduling question
4/28/19, 12:31 PM - Sahil Garg: Ohh damn, didn't complete ?

5/13/19, 9:19 AM - Sahil Garg: They'll have career sites to apply at but I think corporate ones are done, they won't be taking for summer anymore
5/13/19, 9:19 AM - Sahil Garg: You can try if you have referral I guess
5/13/19, 9:20 AM - Sahil Garg: Yess better chance for startups cause they don't have onboarding and induction programmes

8/1/19, 7:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro what do I even ask him. Like I'll be in the hall. Can I text him?
8/1/19, 8:56 AM - Sahil Garg: Yeah just text saying can you tell me about the process or whatever you wanna ask
8/1/19, 8:57 AM - Sahil Garg: Saying you're giving interviews today and wanted to know few things
8/1/19, 11:36 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro how do you use a main variable Inna function without passing it as a parameter
8/1/19, 11:37 AM - Sahil Garg: Meaning ?
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Jenit Jain: How do you access it
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: You can either have it as a global variable
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: Or use its pointer
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Not allowed
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: Don't pass the variable
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Sahil Garg: Pass its pointer address
8/1/19, 11:38 AM - Jenit Jain: But you can't pass any arguments
8/1/19, 11:39 AM - Sahil Garg: Store it at a fixed address space then
8/1/19, 11:39 AM - Sahil Garg: That's the only way
8/1/19, 11:39 AM - Sahil Garg: You'll need to know where it is
8/1/19, 11:39 AM - Jenit Jain: You can't use the scope resolution operator any how?
8/1/19, 11:40 AM - Sahil Garg: No scope resolution is only for global and local
8/1/19, 11:40 AM - Sahil Garg: Here it's between 2 functions
8/1/19, 11:40 AM - Sahil Garg: We want to access a variable of func1 in func2 say
8/1/19, 11:41 AM - Jenit Jain: I asked him pointer also he said I can't do that üò≠
8/1/19, 11:41 AM - Sahil Garg: That'll only be if you pass it somehow (address or value) or pointer, or have common memory (global) or store it at fixed constant memory location and use that constant address
8/1/19, 11:41 AM - Sahil Garg: Damn what all did they ask you
8/1/19, 11:41 AM - Sahil Garg: In the interview ?
8/1/19, 11:42 AM - Jenit Jain: Dude !
8/1/19, 11:42 AM - Jenit Jain: Os algo ds cn dbms
8/1/19, 11:42 AM - Jenit Jain: He asked me https vs http
8/1/19, 11:42 AM - Sahil Garg: You knew ?
8/1/19, 11:43 AM - Jenit Jain: I forgot that it was ssl layer but I said more authentication blah blah
8/1/19, 11:43 AM - Jenit Jain: He didn't ask from my CV because most of it is Python related :/ kinda sucks
8/1/19, 11:44 AM - Sahil Garg: To make a variable calculated in function A visible in function B, you have three choices:

make it a global,
make it an object property, or
pass it as a parameter when calling B from A.
If your program is fairly small then globals are not so bad. Otherwise, I would consider using the third method
8/1/19, 11:44 AM - Sahil Garg: Peaceful
8/1/19, 11:44 AM - Sahil Garg: Ayy man it's fine
8/1/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: How many rounds did you have till now? 1?
8/1/19, 11:45 AM - Sahil Garg: And how did DS algo go?
