4/25/20, 7:21 PM - +91 94268 30601: Hi Saurav. I have MSSql server installed on my pc. Is it similar to that or are there any plus points in it?
4/25/20, 7:25 PM - +91 96925 32916: No it is very simple but if you already have MSSql ... practice in that only .. it is good ... both have same functionality with some distinct and additional features .. you can use anything like Oracle, Nosql, MSsql, HANA which is using sql query to run ..
4/25/20, 7:26 PM - Chirag: Register on ibm cloud, there you can get access to their online sql platform, and it has some databases too
4/25/20, 7:27 PM - Chirag: I am almost done with that
4/25/20, 7:29 PM - +963 988 403 832: Any one working in this field remotely? 
My country don't have that AI ready environment so I was trying to search for internship or job online
4/25/20, 7:29 PM - +963 988 403 832: Is it possible?
4/25/20, 7:50 PM - +91 94268 30601: Okay. I was wondering if I could use any pre built databases to practice on those queries. Anyways. I'll try that. Thanks
4/25/20, 7:51 PM - +91 95866 90993: This is great
Thanks man 👍🏻

4/25/20, 8:36 PM - +234 703 359 3600: You can select "Remote" and it send you every Remote job alert, depending on the location you chose
4/25/20, 8:55 PM - +963 988 403 832: That's good idea too, thanks
4/25/20, 8:58 PM - +91 79043 17033: Im kind of total beginner.
I want to pursue MS in Data sci but im from a Mechanical background.
Is anyone lookin forward to take part in some kaggle competitions?
That way we can learn a lot.
4/25/20, 9:09 PM - +91 95866 90993: I'm also a beginner with electrical background.
I'm doing machine learning course by Andrew NG.
After completing that we can take part in kaggle.
4/25/20, 9:09 PM - +91 79043 17033: Okay.
That'll do.
4/25/20, 9:10 PM - +91 95866 90993: 👍🏻
4/25/20, 9:10 PM - +91 80932 02597: What is this kaggle?..can you help..I don't have much idea about this.
4/25/20, 9:12 PM - +91 95866 90993: It's currently best platform for data science as a learning perspective and also there is different competitions in which we can take part of.
4/25/20, 9:17 PM - +91 90474 74677: Same for me too..Am from Mech Background..wanted to take part in kaggle and I was searching for team..
4/25/20, 9:17 PM - +91 90474 74677: I heard Titanic competition in kaggle will be good for beginners
4/25/20, 9:17 PM - +91 72839 99075: I am also new and doing ibm program after this maybe i will
4/25/20, 9:17 PM - +91 79043 17033: Yeah
Heard the same
4/25/20, 9:18 PM - +91 79043 17033: IBM is pretty good.
Aight.
4/25/20, 9:18 PM - +91 72839 99075: How is the machine learning course after ibm one i am thinking of doing it
4/25/20, 9:21 PM - +91 96925 32916 added +234 802 069 3572
4/25/20, 9:19 PM - +91 79043 17033: Andrew Ng is the best course for ML i suppose
4/25/20, 9:19 PM - +91 72839 99075: Yeahhh but have to search manything outside it too
4/25/20, 9:19 PM - +91 95866 90993: Yes. That's true
4/25/20, 9:20 PM - +91 72839 99075: Thanks mate
4/25/20, 9:20 PM - +91 72839 99075: Will do it after this
4/25/20, 9:22 PM - +963 988 403 832: Like what? I didn't take this course yet I'm completing the IBM program but should I study something else before Andrew course?
4/25/20, 9:24 PM - +91 79043 17033: I haven't done Andrew Ng yet.
But I've heard it starts from scratch.
Can someone confirm?
4/25/20, 9:28 PM - +91 72839 99075: Like you need to learn python outside this course too because here it just gives you the overview and same about SQL too
4/25/20, 9:29 PM - +91 72839 99075: Try to solve questions online for a good grasp over language
4/25/20, 9:31 PM - +91 80932 02597: Thanks for the info👍🏻
4/25/20, 9:36 PM - +91 95866 90993: There are No prerequisites so u can start whenever u want

4/25/20, 10:26 PM - +91 95866 90993: No they teach in octave or MATLAB
4/25/20, 10:26 PM - +237 6 79 60 77 32: wow
4/25/20, 10:28 PM - Chirag: Should i pursue it? I don't have any knowledge about those
4/25/20, 10:29 PM - +91 95866 90993: U should definitely try that 
After 1st assignment you'll be fine.

4/28/20, 12:17 PM - +91 98180 25356: Hi all, I was hoping for some help in understanding this function in the IBM data Science Course>Python for AI and Data science>Intros to APIs :

def one_dict(list_dict):
    keys=list_dict[0].keys()
    out_dict={key:[] for key in keys}
    for dict_ in list_dict:
        for key, value in dict_.items():
            out_dict[key].append(value)
    return out_dict
4/28/20, 12:18 PM - +91 98180 25356: how are the for loops working?
4/28/20, 1:33 PM - +91 96925 32916: Before that could you please tell me the value of list_dict, give me a screenshot...

4/28/20, 1:48 PM - +33 7 53 94 81 96: Hello all, I hope that everyone is safe and I am very pleased to join the group
4/28/20, 1:53 PM - +237 6 79 60 77 32: Welcome
4/28/20, 1:54 PM - +33 7 53 94 81 96: Thanks Montero
4/28/20, 1:55 PM - +237 6 79 60 77 32: Ur welcome
4/28/20, 2:07 PM - +91 98180 25356: List_dict is a list of dictionaries, example:

[ { 'Name' : 'A', 'Age' : 20 }, {'Name' : 'D', 'Age' : 22 }, {'Name' : 'G', 'Age' : 18 } ]
4/28/20, 2:38 PM - Chirag: http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
4/28/20, 2:39 PM - Chirag: you should go to this site, enter your code and you can run it step by step and see for yourself what it is doing in each step
4/28/20, 2:53 PM - +91 98180 25356: Thanks Chirag, will surely check this out..
4/28/20, 3:09 PM - +91 96925 32916: It is converting to a single dictionary of list ... 

{'Name': ['A', 'D'], 'Age': [20, 22]}
4/28/20, 3:10 PM - +91 96925 32916: {key:[] for key in keys} is the turning line which makes a dictionary with empty list value where we can append as many values as we want ..
4/28/20, 3:24 PM - +91 72839 99075: Would it be ok if i do the ML course of andrew ng as it is in Matlab?
4/28/20, 3:25 PM - +91 72839 99075: Like mostly is used in different platforms that is why?
4/28/20, 3:48 PM - +91 72839 99075: Python is*
4/28/20, 5:22 PM - +91 80555 23200: This course will clear all concepts of ML so it doesn't matter which platform its using.. once you are clear with concepts you can apply it python , R or anywhere
4/28/20, 6:39 PM - +91 72839 99075: Thanks man

4/28/20, 10:46 PM - +91 72994 17624: U have already used for loop in another language ?
4/28/20, 11:00 PM - +91 98180 25356: Hi, yes I am familiar with loops in C++ and Java, but was getting confused about what value is picked up by the iterating variable and also what kind of datatypes it involves. 
Fortunately my confusion was cleared by Chirag's suggested tool.
4/28/20, 11:00 PM - +91 98180 25356: Thanks for this Chirag!
4/28/20, 11:01 PM - Chirag: Welcome, brother
4/28/20, 11:08 PM - +91 72994 17624: The iterating variable picks up whatever value is present in the pointed data
4/28/20, 11:09 PM - +91 72994 17624: Unlike c++, in PYTHON there is no need to create a variable which u want to iterate with the loops
4/28/20, 11:10 PM - +91 72994 17624: For any loop in python, the iterating variable is created automatically and takes any value type like str or int
4/28/20, 11:11 PM - +91 72994 17624: This confusion was pricking me also in the beginning
4/28/20, 11:42 PM - +91 98180 25356: 👍🏻
True, after going through it step by step, it now makes complete sense, and seems a logically quite natural way to work with data structures!

5/4/20, 1:42 PM - +91 90922 28148: Trying restarting the server...
5/4/20, 1:43 PM - +91 96925 32916: Check you are connected to internet or not
5/4/20, 1:43 PM - +91 94268 30601: Yes. Connected
5/4/20, 1:44 PM - +91 94268 30601: I tried closing and starting it again.
5/4/20, 1:49 PM - +91 90922 28148: Is jupyter opening in the browser?
5/4/20, 1:49 PM - +91 90922 28148: Or is it just not launching ??
5/4/20, 1:49 PM - +91 90922 28148: Are you using anaconda ?
5/4/20, 1:50 PM - +91 94268 30601: Nope. It just goes on processing
5/4/20, 1:50 PM - +91 90922 28148: ...
5/4/20, 1:50 PM - +91 94268 30601: Nope. I am launching it dromedary Cmd
5/4/20, 1:50 PM - +91 94268 30601: From*
5/4/20, 1:51 PM - +91 90922 28148: I meat what python distribution you are using ??
5/4/20, 1:51 PM - +91 90922 28148: Any recent changes that you made ??
5/4/20, 1:51 PM - +91 94268 30601: Yesterday, i created a virtual env and downloaded Django in that
5/4/20, 1:52 PM - +91 94268 30601: Nothing other than that
5/4/20, 1:52 PM - +91 90922 28148: .
5/4/20, 1:52 PM - +91 90922 28148: Anaconda??
5/4/20, 1:52 PM - +91 90922 28148: Did you install the jupyter notebook in the venv ?
5/4/20, 1:53 PM - +91 94268 30601: Nope. I installed it simply by pip install, not in venv
5/4/20, 1:53 PM - +91 94268 30601: No. I am not using that
5/4/20, 1:53 PM - +91 94268 30601: I have python 3.5
5/4/20, 1:54 PM - +91 94268 30601: Sorry. 3.8
5/4/20, 1:54 PM - +91 90922 28148: Try installing jupyter notebook and in the venv
5/4/20, 1:54 PM - +91 94268 30601: Ok. Let me try that
5/4/20, 1:54 PM - +91 90922 28148: Is jupyter launching from the base environment ?
5/4/20, 1:55 PM - +91 94268 30601: Nope
5/4/20, 1:55 PM - +91 90922 28148: Damm
5/4/20, 1:56 PM - +91 90922 28148: Only thing that comes to my mind is uninstalling jupyter notebook
5/4/20, 1:56 PM - +91 90922 28148: And then trying to install it again
5/4/20, 1:56 PM - +91 90922 28148: pip install notebook
5/4/20, 1:56 PM - +91 94268 30601: One of my friend faced the same issue and he said it got resolved once he reinstalled it. But the issue came back again after 2 days
5/4/20, 1:59 PM - +91 90922 28148: pip install django-extensions
5/4/20, 1:59 PM - +91 90922 28148: Do this and then try ??
5/4/20, 2:00 PM - +91 94268 30601: Ok
5/4/20, 2:00 PM - +91 90922 28148: Just a doubt...
5/4/20, 2:02 PM - +91 90922 28148: It doesn't makes sense to work with Django on jupyter?? Why not try to use vscode or something else? How are you starting the server and other stuff with jupyter ?
5/4/20, 2:02 PM - +91 90922 28148: 🤔🤔🤔
5/4/20, 2:03 PM - +91 94268 30601: Sorry. Didn't get you 😅
5/4/20, 2:03 PM - +91 90922 28148: Why not use vscode or any other editor ?
5/4/20, 2:03 PM - +91 90922 28148: 😀🤔🤔😀
5/4/20, 2:04 PM - +91 94268 30601: Actually, i am doing one course from Ineuron, and there we need to use this Jupyter
5/4/20, 2:04 PM - +91 90922 28148: Ohhh
5/4/20, 2:05 PM - +91 90922 28148: Bro I am out of ideas....

5/4/20, 2:05 PM - +91 94268 30601: I'll check what I can do
5/4/20, 2:06 PM - +91 90922 28148: If I was in this situation, I would just completely remove python, trying to install anaconda
5/4/20, 2:06 PM - +91 90922 28148: I have also suffered a lot of tragedies with pip....
5/4/20, 2:07 PM - +91 90922 28148: I trying avoiding pip to maximum extent possible...
5/4/20, 2:07 PM - +91 94268 30601: I don't know about anaconda. Are there any advantages of that over pip?
5/4/20, 2:08 PM - +91 90922 28148: Yeah...It does a better job of managing dependencies of library
5/4/20, 2:08 PM - +91 90922 28148: If you want to install anything
5/4/20, 2:08 PM - +91 90922 28148: Just do conda install libraryname on Google
5/4/20, 2:09 PM - +91 90922 28148: And you are good to go
5/4/20, 2:09 PM - +91 94268 30601: Uh. Huh🤔
5/4/20, 2:09 PM - +91 90922 28148: Conda vs pop
5/4/20, 2:09 PM - +91 94268 30601: Let me try that out
5/4/20, 2:10 PM - +91 90922 28148: Trust me on this one, I have removed my ubuntu at least 10 times just because of the library dependency issues, while working on on a project on odroid
5/4/20, 2:12 PM - +91 94268 30601: Uh huh. Are you an android developer?
5/4/20, 2:15 PM - +91 90922 28148: Did a bit of app dev, during last year
5/4/20, 2:15 PM - +91 90922 28148: Odroid is SoC similar to Rpi

5/4/20, 2:24 PM - +91 94268 30601: Actually, it's better. Sometimes we need some change while playing with a single language . And you have changes all the time

5/6/20, 12:14 AM - +91 80555 23200: What are you learning ?
If you want to start with python and free course.. start with IBM data science.. otherwise start any course on other free resources depending on your interest .and apply for financial aid on coursera for some good course. By the time you get aid you will learn the basics
5/6/20, 12:14 AM - +91 96633 11499: Ok
5/6/20, 12:16 AM - +91 96633 11499: I'm at machine learning course from the IBM course

5/6/20, 12:16 AM - +91 96633 11499: Any suggestions what next
5/6/20, 12:21 AM - +91 80555 23200: Thats great I think you should start participating in the Kaggle compititions after this course.
While solving actual problems you will get to know where you want to focus and where you lack
5/6/20, 12:21 AM - +91 96633 11499: Thank you so much. I'll give it a try.

5/6/20, 4:17 AM - +92 333 2873132: Curiosity and Storytelling are vital for Data Scientist as the technical skills are.
I suggest developing both technical and non technical skills side by side.
This is a very good Storytelling course on Coursera.

5/6/20, 4:20 AM - +92 333 2873132: This is more on the practical side of Storytelling via data.
5/6/20, 10:39 PM - +91 75035 77751: Is data science field gud for bachelor in mathematics student?
5/6/20, 10:40 PM - +234 813 156 6010: As long as you have the Passion for it.........✌🏾
5/6/20, 10:43 PM - +91 75035 77751: But there is a gap of 3 yrs after graduation but i was doing part time job as data entry operator as well as preparing for the government job..now i want to make in data science..so is it possible that i can get job in this field with such profile!
5/6/20, 11:38 PM - +92 333 2873132: Yes, data science is a field that can be adopted any time. You just need to develop the essential technical and non technical skills.

Moreover with your Mathematics background, you are already a step in Data Science journey with a good understanding of Algebra and Statistics.

All you need now is a few programming courses and AI techniques to get started on your first project and then you can progress further.

Good luck.
5/6/20, 11:42 PM - +254 741 803062: personally i beleive if it is in you and you have the will to do something then you will always achieve what you want
5/6/20, 11:43 PM - +91 75035 77751: 👍🏻
5/6/20, 11:43 PM - +91 75035 77751: Yep...
5/6/20, 11:44 PM - +254 741 803062: if you want something no matter how small the chances are or big always put yourself  among those that will get it....
5/6/20, 11:45 PM - +254 741 803062: datascience is a good choice but dnt try to learn everything in it you will lose hope
5/6/20, 11:46 PM - +91 75035 77751: Yeah it contains a lot of things
5/6/20, 11:50 PM - +254 741 803062: focus and master from basics ...
5/6/20, 11:50 PM - +91 75035 77751: Yeah sure
5/6/20, 11:56 PM - +91 80555 23200: If you specifically talk about getting job its difficult.. but not impossible.
Initially you will have to adjust with payment terms or work as intern

5/7/20, 12:13 AM - +963 988 403 832: Hi guys
5/7/20, 12:13 AM - +963 988 403 832: If you worked with
5/7/20, 12:13 AM - +963 988 403 832: Matplotlib
5/7/20, 12:14 AM - +963 988 403 832: What is the meaning of this command 
%matplotlib online?
5/7/20, 12:14 AM - +963 988 403 832: Inline*
5/7/20, 12:14 AM - +963 988 403 832: And what is the difference, because I can't notice the impact of this command
5/7/20, 12:19 AM - +234 813 156 6010: Please upload
🙏🏽
5/7/20, 12:21 AM - +91 80555 23200: That means you can see graphs on same page
Its a magic function
Without that line your graphs open as html page
5/7/20, 12:22 AM - +963 988 403 832: Hmm but no difference with the shapes, no?
5/7/20, 12:22 AM - +91 80555 23200: No
5/7/20, 12:22 AM - +963 988 403 832: Ok that's great thank you so much
5/7/20, 12:23 AM - +963 988 403 832: I like how can I ask questions when I'm working, thank you guys appreciate it so much
5/7/20, 12:26 AM - +91 80555 23200: This is Ipython function only works with Jupyter notebook based platform
5/7/20, 12:27 AM - +963 988 403 832: Yea I'm working with anaconda environment
5/7/20, 12:27 AM - +963 988 403 832: But I figured out recently that's not practical so much
5/7/20, 12:27 AM - +963 988 403 832: It's ok for working with courses and books examples
5/7/20, 12:28 AM - +963 988 403 832: But it's hard to handle large data set
5/7/20, 12:28 AM - +963 988 403 832: So I'm learning how to work with kaggle
5/7/20, 12:28 AM - +963 988 403 832: It let you work with really large data sets in its kernel
5/7/20, 12:29 AM - +963 988 403 832: Just in one command it's so easy to import the data set and apply python commands and work with
5/7/20, 12:30 AM - +963 988 403 832: But as I'm in the beginning I don't know how things work in the real world I mean companies or teams working in their projects
5/7/20, 12:31 AM - +91 72839 99075: It will let you see the graph on same page but can't alter it afterwards
5/7/20, 12:31 AM - +91 72839 99075: For that you need to use notebook i guess instead of inline
5/7/20, 12:32 AM - +91 72839 99075: To make changes afterwards
5/7/20, 12:34 AM - +91 80555 23200: I think its better to work on your pc/ laptop too..
I experienced that many times my work is giving proper results on course platform but gives error when try on my own Jupyter notebook
5/7/20, 12:34 AM - +91 80555 23200: So use both
5/7/20, 12:35 AM - +91 80555 23200: And instead of Jupyter notebook you can try vscode.. if you use vscode for other files editing its easy to integrate

5/7/20, 12:40 AM - +963 988 403 832: It's not the editor the problem with internet connection it will take so long time to download data set with more than 4 GB and my laptop is weak a little bit so for now I'm working with collab too but it's not so easily so I like kaggle kernel mot
5/7/20, 12:40 AM - +963 988 403 832: More

5/8/20, 2:29 AM - +91 80555 23200: I made exact same resume in word
5/8/20, 2:31 AM - +91 80555 23200: Actually I prefer Photoshop but then I read that photoshop cvs text is not detected by auto text detection.. so word is preferred
5/8/20, 2:31 AM - +91 73377 22233: 😮😮 I don't know much options to do the same
5/8/20, 2:32 AM - +91 80555 23200: If you want easy way try resume builder sites or apps
5/8/20, 2:32 AM - +91 80555 23200: But customisation is difficult in those apps
5/8/20, 2:35 AM - +91 80555 23200: This one is easy in word just skill bars is difficult work
5/8/20, 2:36 AM - +91 80555 23200: Or this one is neat and simple
5/8/20, 2:36 AM - +91 73377 22233: Yeah let me try few of them to create.
5/8/20, 2:38 AM - +91 80555 23200: For making 2 partitions use table
5/8/20, 2:39 AM - +91 73377 22233: Ok..about bars?

5/8/20, 2:43 AM - +91 80555 23200: In Excel u can create any type of graph
5/8/20, 8:03 AM - +91 96925 32916: I guess simple resume is the best...  I have seen those who takes interviews...  They are pretty much frustrated because they could not match the skill written in resume with the questions they asked to candidates...  So most of the time they either don't see the resume or will just have a glance to know your basic details...  But when we are giving all answer then they might see our resume and asked couple of questions but they don't care at all about our bar, chart in resume..  It is just my opinion...
5/8/20, 8:06 AM - +91 73377 22233: Thanks a lot all for ur inputs.

5/14/20, 11:54 PM - +91 72994 17624: try government websites, try searching kaggle datasets also
5/14/20, 11:55 PM - +91 96633 11499: Most of the hospitals are not mapped at all
5/14/20, 11:55 PM - +91 72994 17624: kaggle might give you other datasets also which may be interesting to you

5/24/20, 3:57 PM - +91 96636 21030: What the meaning of random state in test train split
5/24/20, 3:57 PM - +91 74628 93524 left
5/24/20, 4:40 PM - +91 98997 61004: Not used in real world random state
5/24/20, 4:42 PM - +91 98997 61004: But yes to get the result uninamous in a group of people it get used
5/24/20, 5:06 PM - +91 96636 21030: In my model when I used random state as 0,1 it was throwing error.but when I tried 42 it started working
5/24/20, 5:06 PM - +91 96636 21030: Any idea?
5/24/20, 5:06 PM - +91 96636 21030: And at many examples they simply use 42
5/24/20, 5:11 PM - Chirag: I think there is problem in your data, and in state 42 that value is not getting used in model
5/24/20, 5:11 PM - Chirag: Look for that error value
5/24/20, 5:14 PM - +91 98997 61004: You can pick any number
5/24/20, 5:15 PM - +91 98997 61004: It may single digit or double , triple
5/24/20, 5:15 PM - +91 98997 61004: But not in . Or , format
5/24/20, 5:16 PM - +234 810 444 4362: But i thought you could use decimals like 0.3 
You just need to make them the same in your code
5/24/20, 5:18 PM - +234 810 444 4362: Or must it be 0's or None?
5/24/20, 5:19 PM - +91 96636 21030: I checked it again and now with value 0 it's giving good result. I don't know what's wrong with my code.
5/24/20, 5:20 PM - +91 96636 21030: How can we determine what value should be used?
5/24/20, 5:20 PM - +234 810 444 4362: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42191717/python-random-state-in-splitting-dataset
5/24/20, 5:22 PM - +91 96636 21030: 👍 got it why it's needed.what what value to be used?
5/24/20, 5:22 PM - +91 96636 21030: I am still not very clear on this
5/24/20, 5:29 PM - Chirag: It's just choosing values from your data randomly and dividing into two groups
5/24/20, 5:30 PM - Chirag: Assigning a state means that whenever you will run ut again, same random data will be used
5/24/20, 5:30 PM - Chirag: If no state is assigned, each time it will randomly select values and your results might be different each time
5/24/20, 5:31 PM - +91 96636 21030: 👍
5/24/20, 5:31 PM - Chirag: So you have just paused the process and stopped it from distribution of data
5/24/20, 5:31 PM - +91 96636 21030: Thanks Chirag it helped.
5/24/20, 5:31 PM - Chirag: Welcome brother
5/24/20, 5:31 PM - +91 96636 21030: Thanks a lot

5/25/20, 3:24 PM - Chirag: no, i did it a few weeks ago, couldnt remmeber the commands so i had to look up for this notebook to help you
5/25/20, 3:24 PM - Chirag: 😅
5/25/20, 3:25 PM - +91 90133 14441: Haha  in pic it was showing seconds ago. I was really shcoked
5/25/20, 3:26 PM - +91 90133 14441: So did you have completed profesional certificate
5/25/20, 3:28 PM - Chirag: i had to run them to check whether they were working properly😅, so that i wouldn't misguide you

Step
5/25/20, 3:30 PM - +91 90133 14441: I mean which course you are doing.
5/25/20, 3:30 PM - Chirag: now i am on machine learning course by andrew ng
5/25/20, 3:31 PM - +91 90133 14441: Great that was my plan also
5/25/20, 3:31 PM - Chirag: it will improve your basics
5/25/20, 3:31 PM - +91 90133 14441: I have started from that
5/25/20, 3:31 PM - +91 90133 14441: Have completed linear regression
5/25/20, 3:31 PM - +91 90133 14441: And logistic regression b
5/25/20, 3:32 PM - Chirag: i am on logistic regression
5/25/20, 3:32 PM - Chirag: 😅
5/25/20, 3:32 PM - +91 90133 14441: It have good notes and resources
5/25/20, 3:33 PM - +91 90133 14441: Only con is it requires lot of work
5/25/20, 3:33 PM - Chirag: yesss
5/25/20, 3:33 PM - Chirag: that's why it's really good
5/25/20, 3:33 PM - Chirag: makes you work hard
5/25/20, 3:34 PM - Chirag: unlike others which have most of the code already provided
5/25/20, 3:34 PM - +91 90133 14441: Yep even hos deeplearning. Ai courses are also good 
I have just seen thorughly by auditing
5/25/20, 3:34 PM - Chirag: i was planning to do that also
5/25/20, 3:35 PM - +91 90133 14441: But we do need codes in real world  its practical
5/25/20, 3:35 PM - +91 90133 14441: I think we r going in same direction
5/25/20, 3:35 PM - Chirag: yeah i think so

And ml, deeplearning for concepts
5/25/20, 3:36 PM - Chirag: great!
5/25/20, 3:36 PM - Chirag: same here brother
5/25/20, 3:38 PM - Chirag: have you participated in any online competition?
5/25/20, 3:38 PM - +91 96636 21030: @918860234357 @919013314441 what you guys are planning for practical knowledge?
5/25/20, 3:38 PM - Chirag: i would suggest to participate in competitios
5/25/20, 3:38 PM - Chirag: competitions*
5/25/20, 3:39 PM - +91 90133 14441: No i am   gonna partipate after ml course ibm and also deep learning course ibm
5/25/20, 3:39 PM - Chirag: those would tell you how messy data sets are, feature engineering, and also where you stand among others
5/25/20, 3:40 PM - Chirag: once you are done with the ibm's ml course, you could build basic models
5/25/20, 3:40 PM - +91 90133 14441: I know i have seen data its scary 
Deep learning ibm is is actually good for kaggle competition
5/25/20, 3:41 PM - +91 90133 14441: But it will not give you any rank not evn top 40percent
5/25/20, 3:41 PM - +91 90133 14441: Its very basic
5/25/20, 3:42 PM - +91 96636 21030: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm#courses
5/25/20, 3:42 PM - +91 96636 21030: I have plans for this course
5/25/20, 3:42 PM - +91 96636 21030: Currently going with Andrew ng machine learning
5/25/20, 3:42 PM - +91 90133 14441: Ibm courses have lots of practical exercises 
Whereas stanford ml, deep learning have good concepts but lack exercises
5/25/20, 3:42 PM - +234 810 444 4362: Same
5/25/20, 3:43 PM - +91 96636 21030: I feel for being a good data science we need to have a good story telling skill. So I am even trying to improve my writing skills by solving the problem and sharing the same in the blogs
5/25/20, 3:44 PM - +91 90133 14441: It gives iot data scientist cetificate before doing this go for ibm ai engineering
5/25/20, 3:45 PM - +91 90133 14441: Yes it is
5/25/20, 3:45 PM - Chirag: very good approach!
5/25/20, 3:45 PM - +91 96636 21030: Has anyone joined any meet-up group for machine learning and data science
5/25/20, 3:47 PM - +91 90133 14441: Good

5/25/20, 6:07 PM - +91 72839 99075: Of ML
5/25/20, 6:08 PM - +91 72839 99075: Ohh.. okay, if you find any please share😊
5/25/20, 6:09 PM - +91 96636 21030: I feel better go for Andrew ng course first
5/25/20, 6:11 PM - +91 72839 99075: Okay, thanks 😊

5/31/20, 7:08 PM - Chirag: 😅
5/31/20, 7:08 PM - +91 90133 14441: Ibm Ml week 3 support vector machine
5/31/20, 7:09 PM - +91 90133 14441: I am thinking of doing it side by side
5/31/20, 7:09 PM - +91 90133 14441: What you think ibm ml and stanford ml
5/31/20, 7:09 PM - +91 90133 14441: Together
5/31/20, 7:10 PM - +91 90133 14441: Or i should fisrt complete my ibm
5/31/20, 7:15 PM - Chirag: I would suggest first complete the ibm
5/31/20, 7:15 PM - +91 90133 14441: Is capstone project is hard and how much time will it take
5/31/20, 7:16 PM - Chirag: Because stanford's uses Octave, so it would be better if you focus on it
5/31/20, 7:16 PM - Chirag: It's not really hard
5/31/20, 7:16 PM - +91 96633 11499: What is Octave
5/31/20, 7:16 PM - Chirag: Most of the code is available with you
5/31/20, 7:17 PM - Chirag: You only need the idea
5/31/20, 7:17 PM - +91 90133 14441: You r doing at octave
5/31/20, 7:17 PM - Chirag: Yes
5/31/20, 7:17 PM - +91 90133 14441: Not matlab
5/31/20, 7:17 PM - +91 90133 14441: Then it will be good
5/31/20, 7:17 PM - +91 90133 14441: My maths skills are good but i sucks at progrmamming
5/31/20, 7:18 PM - +91 90133 14441: I was also doing octave matlab hangs

5/31/20, 8:36 PM - +91 96633 11499: But I wouldn't have been to complete the rest of the courses from the IBM Data Science course without the IBM discount

I just completed my Bachelor of Engineering(B.E) in Biomedical Engineering from Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai. I have just started my Data Science journey, so I look forward to interacting with you guys and learn more about this field. I would appreciate any guidance, tips, or even a conversation with anyone, even on personal chat. 😁😁
6/4/20, 1:17 AM - Chirag: Sure brother 👍
6/4/20, 1:38 AM - +91 90299 89325: 😁. I have completed few courses, so any useful courses, websites anyone could recommend I should pursue next?
6/4/20, 1:43 AM - Chirag: what all have you done?
6/4/20, 1:44 AM - +91 90299 89325: 2 courses from the data science specialization from Johns Hopkins, and 2 from IBM introduction to Data Science Specialization.
6/4/20, 1:45 AM - Chirag: john hopkins is for R i guess🤔
6/4/20, 1:45 AM - +91 90299 89325: Yes
6/4/20, 1:46 AM - +91 90299 89325: I thought I could learn basics there and side by side do the IBM specialization
6/4/20, 1:46 AM - Chirag: if you want to learn basics
6/4/20, 1:46 AM - Chirag: try the stanford one
6/4/20, 1:46 AM - Chirag: by andrew ng

6/4/20, 11:18 AM - +91 72994 17624: bro he shared a free webinar. Shouldn't we try to make use of it ? Though I'm completely agreeing with you keeping the group clean in this way

6/4/20, 12:19 PM - +91 96925 32916: This screenshot is his profile pics...  And go to his website...  First they will say it is completely free but later on (just after couple of class) they will ask to pay the amount ... If we want to attend some paid classes.... Google will help to shortout the best classes...  And other facebook groups are filled with these kind of advertisement that they will make us data scientist in 30k INR ... yes surely these classes will help to give a initial start... But this group is not made for that purpose ... Obviously we can seek suggestion from other people that which classes or Courses will be better and it is always welcome... But agents of a any particular class are not allowed....  Clearing doubts, stuck in somewhere in code, what to do next, confusion, competition, content, blogs,  suggestion for paid courses by our friend are always welcome but agents are not allowed..  I don't want any member to feel irritated because of these advertisement..
6/4/20, 12:24 PM - +91 72994 17624: ok bro, I get it, I appreciate it too
6/4/20, 12:24 PM - +91 96925 32916: Now the question is how do we identify the agents...  The moment he joined this group.. He immediately posted free Webinaar session because his mind is set.. Similarly my mind is also set... The moment I will recognise that agents are there... Immediately block.. 😄✌️
Happy learning 👍
6/4/20, 12:24 PM - Chirag: His name also had the company name he is associated with

6/5/20, 4:13 PM - +92 333 2873132: For a web application to scale, it would require two different approaches to scale itself as the databases are different.
6/5/20, 4:24 PM - +91 94268 30601: Can someone explain the schema point?

6/5/20, 7:13 PM - +92 333 2873132: Schema is the data where you know the type of data like int, varchar, char etc. In other words you know what's coming in your database.
A good example is forms on websites. Each input has a specific label and field. Like your name will be a string. Age a number etc...
6/5/20, 7:14 PM - +92 333 2873132: On the other data where you cannot know what type of data will come from the user is non-schema.
Like emails, comments. You never know what a user will comment. Number emojis gif image. There's all sorts of probabilities.
6/5/20, 7:40 PM - +91 94268 30601: Understood. Thanks buddy. Your explanations are great
6/5/20, 7:44 PM - +92 333 2873132: Thanks man. I was thinking of starting a blog.
That's a reinforcing feedback.
But yeah, the sentences will be more clearer. It looks pretty jogged up but I am glad you understood the point.

It will be on an another area of interest.

Again thanks for showing interest.

I have an excel sheet on my laptop which is also saved on the cloud and therefore has a URL.
I'm trying to use python in jupyter notebook/Google colab and access the data of this excel file *using URL* and not the name of the file directly. 
But everytime I run the code it shows me "error 404: permission to access file denied"
All my excel permission settings to edit are allowed. Can anyone guide me as to where I'm going wrong?
Thanks

6/7/20, 5:30 PM - +91 98214 14152: Hey, I just went through this. It is basically extracting the data and saving it in a local storage of my Google colab. But let's say if I go to my excel sheet stored in the drive, and change a few values there, my locally stored excel sheet in Google colab will not reflect the same changes.
What I'm saying is-
If I keep changing my excel sheet values, then my colab notebook does not know of that, as a copy of the previous excel has been stored in my Google colab. Which means, my colab notebook is not able to access *live* data and is only accessing data from a locally stored datasheet
6/7/20, 6:54 PM - +91 93734 27727: Ohh ,Now I get it,and sorry but I don't know how to add live excel file to the colab

6/7/20, 11:05 PM - +91 90299 89325: Guys how did you finalize on a specialization? Johns Hopkins, IBM, University of Michigan all have good specializations for Data science.
6/7/20, 11:07 PM - +91 98214 14152: Hey! I did that too. But I just came to know that you can do it using API
6/7/20, 11:08 PM - +91 98214 14152: Does anyone know an efficient way to learn API?
6/7/20, 11:20 PM - +91 78274 60556: My question exactly.
Please let us know how you decided
6/7/20, 11:22 PM - +91 78274 60556: And what is code Vita 2020?
6/7/20, 11:22 PM - +91 72839 99075: Just start with anyone you like
6/7/20, 11:23 PM - +91 72839 99075: Seeing reviews
6/7/20, 11:23 PM - +91 72839 99075: I started with ibm one
6/7/20, 11:23 PM - Chirag: I got an answer to that question in a lecture
6/7/20, 11:24 PM - Chirag: You can choose any one of them, or you can do all them because sometimes, different perspectives will help you alot
6/7/20, 11:24 PM - Chirag: I completed the ibm's professional certificate
6/7/20, 11:25 PM - Chirag: And now i am doing the Stanford's and trust me it cleared alot more
6/7/20, 11:26 PM - Chirag: IBM is good to set up a really good base in the field, because it will teach you a little about everything which is important
6/7/20, 11:26 PM - +91 78274 60556: Thanks. That makes sense
6/7/20, 11:27 PM - +91 94455 51818: John Hopkins uses R
IBM uses Python 

- In case if it helps
6/7/20, 11:27 PM - Chirag: Stanford uses Octave/MATLAB
6/7/20, 11:28 PM - +91 78274 60556: That's Andrew Ng's one right?
6/7/20, 11:28 PM - Chirag: Yes
6/7/20, 11:29 PM - +91 78274 60556: I am doing that one. I am on week 5. It's really good for clearing basics
6/7/20, 11:29 PM - Chirag: Great!
6/7/20, 11:29 PM - Chirag: I am on week 7
6/7/20, 11:30 PM - +91 78274 60556: Awesome.
Just curious. Is week 5 assignment easy or difficult?
6/7/20, 11:31 PM - Chirag: Difficult
6/7/20, 11:31 PM - +91 70206 06621: I'm doing the same..
6/7/20, 11:31 PM - Chirag: You'll have to understand the formula very clearly
6/7/20, 11:31 PM - Chirag: If get it, then it's really easy
6/7/20, 11:32 PM - +91 78274 60556: Wow. Wish me luck then I guess lol
6/7/20, 11:32 PM - +91 88261 97108: About the standford course.. Is it really important to learn all those formulas by heart regarding algorithms and deep learning? As i am having hard time learning those but i get the concepts and logics
6/7/20, 11:33 PM - Chirag: Only understanding the concept is the main thing
6/7/20, 11:33 PM - +91 78274 60556: If you understand them. You don't need to memorize
6/7/20, 11:33 PM - Chirag: You'll have ready tu use libraries for almost everything you'll learn
6/7/20, 11:34 PM - Chirag: To*
6/7/20, 11:34 PM - +91 88261 97108: Great thanks!
6/7/20, 11:34 PM - +91 78274 60556: Exactly.
6/7/20, 11:34 PM - +91 88261 97108: I have already started using python for algorithms and I am comfortable with it
6/7/20, 11:34 PM - +91 88261 97108: Also took titanic challenge
6/7/20, 11:34 PM - Chirag: Nicee!
6/7/20, 11:35 PM - Chirag: On kaggle, right?
6/7/20, 11:35 PM - +91 88261 97108: Yes
6/7/20, 11:35 PM - Chirag: I have been meaning to do that
6/7/20, 11:36 PM - Chirag: But didn't do it yet
6/7/20, 11:36 PM - Chirag: 😅
6/7/20, 11:36 PM - +91 88261 97108: I learn faster by doing it by myself.. And actually understood a lot through the challenge
6/7/20, 11:36 PM - +91 88261 97108: And most probably won't take any more courses after standford
6/7/20, 11:37 PM - Chirag: Actually that is the key!
6/7/20, 11:37 PM - +91 78274 60556: I found a few resources which implemented all assignments of Andrew Ng's course in python but will have to search again
6/7/20, 11:37 PM - Chirag: I also learnt mostly by doing projects
6/7/20, 11:37 PM - +91 88261 97108: Yeah
6/7/20, 11:37 PM - Chirag: If you find it, do share please
6/7/20, 11:38 PM - +91 78274 60556: Definitely

6/7/20, 11:54 PM - +234 807 677 1953: Possible to specialize in Data science and ML?

Or if I want to apply my data science skill to public health and genetics, what would you advise I go for?
6/8/20, 1:08 AM - +91 90299 89325: I'm not sure but bioinformatics or computational biology fields may match your requirements.
6/8/20, 1:08 AM - +91 90299 89325: I want to know this too

6/8/20, 12:02 PM - +91 82971 21289: For sales as b
6/8/20, 12:03 PM - +91 82971 21289: And write 

On a.products=b.sales
6/8/20, 12:03 PM - +91 82971 21289: After
6/8/20, 12:03 PM - +971 50 518 4551: aliasing is pre-requisite?
6/8/20, 12:03 PM - +91 82971 21289: Not really
6/8/20, 12:04 PM - +91 82971 21289: Is productid column name?
6/8/20, 12:04 PM - +971 50 518 4551: yes it is
6/8/20, 12:04 PM - +91 82971 21289: Then write as products.productid = sales.productid
6/8/20, 12:05 PM - +971 50 518 4551: if aliasing is not pre-requisite in join then why is it giving error?
6/8/20, 12:06 PM - +91 82971 21289: You have written column name.tablename
6/8/20, 12:06 PM - +234 703 457 0815: Yea
6/8/20, 12:06 PM - +91 82971 21289: That might be reason
6/8/20, 12:06 PM - +234 703 457 0815: It should be table name.column name
6/8/20, 12:06 PM - +91 82971 21289: Yes
6/8/20, 12:07 PM - +234 703 457 0815: And join on a column that is common to both tables(primary key)
6/8/20, 12:07 PM - +971 50 518 4551: <Media omitted>
6/8/20, 12:08 PM - +971 50 518 4551: I'm getting this now
6/8/20, 12:08 PM - +91 82971 21289: Instead of * give specific column names 😊
6/8/20, 12:08 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Ah ok
6/8/20, 12:11 PM - +234 703 457 0815: Why joining the other table when you are not making any selection from it?
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +971 50 518 4551: <Media omitted>
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Thx!
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +971 50 518 4551: No idea 😄
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +971 50 518 4551: I'm very new to sql
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +91 82971 21289: No worries
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +91 82971 21289: Take your time to learn....
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +971 50 518 4551: In fact I'm very new to IT and data science
6/8/20, 12:12 PM - +971 50 518 4551: 👍🏼
6/8/20, 12:13 PM - +91 82971 21289: But understand concepts very well.... it will help in long time 😊
6/8/20, 12:13 PM - +234 703 457 0815: Ok
6/8/20, 12:13 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Yeah i guess
6/8/20, 12:13 PM - +234 807 677 1953: Need to know this alongside python? @918297121289
6/8/20, 12:14 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Not easy at all😩
6/8/20, 12:15 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Cuz i don't know the fundamentals of algorithm.  Maybe I should learn this first?
6/8/20, 12:15 PM - +971 50 518 4551: I beg your pardon?
6/8/20, 12:17 PM - +234 703 457 0815: U'll get used to it.
6/8/20, 12:17 PM - +880 1837-305388: Hi guys, I'm quite new to learn data science, would  you tell me where from will well educate about data science?
6/8/20, 12:17 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Python is like sql?
6/8/20, 12:18 PM - +234 807 677 1953: I'm asking if SQL should/ must be learnt alongside python
6/8/20, 12:19 PM - +971 50 518 4551: Ah ok well for sure u r not asking the right guy cuz I'm lost myself
6/8/20, 12:19 PM - +971 50 518 4551: <Media omitted>
6/8/20, 12:20 PM - +234 703 457 0815: Both should be learnt. They don't substitute each other.....Both are very important.
6/8/20, 12:21 PM - +971 50 518 4551: What about R?
6/8/20, 12:21 PM - +971 50 518 4551: R is like Python?
6/8/20, 12:21 PM - +971 50 518 4551: What are they used for?
6/8/20, 12:22 PM - +234 807 677 1953: I need to clear this then
6/8/20, 12:23 PM - +234 807 677 1953: Pls any Data scientist specializing/specialised in health here.
6/8/20, 12:23 PM - +234 807 677 1953: ?
6/8/20, 12:23 PM - +234 703 457 0815: They are both programming languages for data science...though python is widely used and preferrable.
6/8/20, 12:23 PM - +91 96925 32916: Sql is a beautiful language and very fast compare to python and can directly work with the databases..  Whereas python and R are used for more complex analytical problems...
6/8/20, 12:24 PM - +234 807 677 1953: What are the skillsets needed to be a "health" data scientist?
6/8/20, 12:24 PM - +91 96925 32916: SQL is also more user friendly and understandble..  But it doesn't have much functions or library as R and python
6/8/20, 12:24 PM - +234 807 677 1953: Thabk you very much?😁
6/8/20, 12:24 PM - +91 78018 60670: yes

6/8/20, 12:28 PM - +91 82971 21289: You need to understand health industry.... along with your learning on tools, algorithms, statistics etc...
6/8/20, 12:28 PM - +91 82971 21289: Once you understand business area, you will be able to implement ur learning in right direction 😊
6/8/20, 12:29 PM - +234 810 444 4362: A good grounding in statistics, experiment design, risk scoring, scripting languages, databases, and visualization.
6/8/20, 12:47 PM - +91 77488 36262: R is mainly used for tasks related to statistics and where as python is a general purpose languages and we get a great library support in python 
That's why python is used more hence more popular and R is less used.

If you have interest in statistics and are doing ML to get into that domain you should learn R.
6/8/20, 12:49 PM - +91 70206 06621: 🙌🏻
6/8/20, 1:19 PM - +971 50 518 4551: So would you recommend Python for data visualization from sql?
6/8/20, 1:21 PM - +91 77488 36262: Yup
6/8/20, 2:24 PM - +91 90133 14441: Hi can any one tell me how to import geopy in anaconda
6/8/20, 2:24 PM - +91 90133 14441: I have  already tried by method given in
python.Org  for this
6/8/20, 3:23 PM - +234 703 457 0815: !Conda install forge geopy --yes
6/8/20, 3:23 PM - +234 703 457 0815: You can try this.
6/8/20, 3:29 PM - +234 703 457 0815: !conda install -c conda-forge geopy --yes
6/8/20, 3:29 PM - +234 703 457 0815: That's the code.
6/8/20, 3:32 PM - +91 90133 14441: No it works by pip install
6/8/20, 3:33 PM - +91 90133 14441: I have tried this one  and also one  in python.org
6/8/20, 3:36 PM - +234 810 444 4362: !pip install geopy
6/8/20, 3:37 PM - +234 810 444 4362: Try it in your notebook
6/8/20, 3:37 PM - +91 90133 14441: Yep that works
6/8/20, 3:38 PM - +91 90133 14441: How do we know which command we have to use to install modules
6/8/20, 3:39 PM - +91 90133 14441: Its wierd bcoz i use ananocnda and commands written on anaconda.org doesn't  fit to install it.
6/8/20, 3:40 PM - +234 810 444 4362: To install a module in anaconda, you use the Anaconda Prompt Command
6/8/20, 3:40 PM - +234 810 444 4362: So installing would start with conda install ..........
6/8/20, 3:41 PM - +91 90133 14441: Thanx next time i am gonna  try this way.
6/8/20, 3:42 PM - +234 810 444 4362: Or the Anaconda Powershell Prompt
6/8/20, 3:43 PM - +234 810 444 4362: 👊
6/8/20, 3:43 PM - +91 90133 14441: Thanks again buddy
6/8/20, 3:44 PM - +234 810 444 4362: Your welcome
6/8/20, 6:08 PM - +234 703 457 0815: I always use that to install whatever module i want to.
6/8/20, 6:08 PM - +234 703 457 0815: I've always had issue with using pip install

It seems soon we will be a group of 250 member...  And now the bad news is how do we add any new members once we will cross..  Any suggestion ? What about Telegram or any other app?
6/9/20, 9:39 AM - +91 96636 21030: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
6/9/20, 9:41 AM - +91 70206 06621: No don't increase lots of members rather than focus on quality.
6/9/20, 9:42 AM - +91 80932 02597: Yes , Telegram would be a good option I guess..
6/9/20, 9:43 AM - +92 333 2873132: Great achievment
6/9/20, 9:44 AM - +92 333 2873132: Slack is best for group discussions
6/9/20, 9:45 AM - +91 99621 79967: 👏👏quality is important. am a new comer to this group and anyone jeopardizing the learning through irrelevant messages will be disturbing. Fyi, been in this group for two days. Learnt a lot
6/9/20, 9:47 AM - +91 82971 21289: Keep this group as is with people who have zeal to learn and share knowledge
6/9/20, 9:48 AM - +91 82971 21289: I hope Facebook who owns WhatsApp now may extend participant limit to next level number 😊
6/9/20, 9:48 AM - +92 333 2873132: BTW the name of the group was very clever DAY-TA
6/9/20, 9:49 AM - +91 70206 06621: Correct
6/9/20, 9:50 AM - +91 98744 44013: Slack is better :)
6/9/20, 10:03 AM - +91 78018 60670: Slack is better

6/9/20, 10:23 AM - +91 96925 32916: Yes I agree  ... I am keeping close eye with every post so that members will not be disturbed and Agents will remain far away from this group..  But many members don't reply so that made me to believe three things :
1. They have started learning and stopped completely
2. They are interested but have not started learning 
3. They have been learning but right now gave a pause 

And it is very difficult to identify whom should I remove and whom should I keep... At the same time new members have to welcome ... Some will be advanced and some will be beginner... And we need members who are advanced and can help us...  There are many post where we don't get reply because we don't know that subject area..  
Now talking about how to handle irrelevant people and messages...  I have to nominate other members as admin of the group and they will also handle those so that we will not be disturbed...  Meanwhile I am exploring Slack to see if we can transfer ourselves there slowly ..
Happy learning ✌️🤟

6/9/20, 10:52 AM - +91 72839 99075: Point
6/9/20, 10:53 AM - +91 72839 99075: As you suggested we do need advance members
6/9/20, 10:53 AM - +91 96633 11499: Agree
6/9/20, 10:53 AM - +91 96633 11499: And we need more people to join the group
6/9/20, 10:54 AM - +91 90133 14441: We also need to be sspecific
6/9/20, 10:55 AM - +91 90133 14441: This group is of data science  and there may be few members who are not of this field
6/9/20, 10:55 AM - +91 72839 99075: I think it would also be a good idea to get connected on linkedin too
6/9/20, 10:55 AM - +91 73377 22233: How to filter those??
6/9/20, 10:56 AM - +91 90133 14441: People should be of data science, data analytics,ai.

6/9/20, 10:57 AM - +91 93734 27727: Yaa
6/9/20, 10:59 AM - +91 90133 14441: Well eg chirag, gentlegenius, sahil, aditya kumar are doing ml and data science courses bcoz they have replied

6/9/20, 11:01 AM - +91 90133 14441: Similarly there are few people who reply or ask questions so we can remember their name and hence do the group cleaning
6/9/20, 11:03 AM - +91 96636 21030: Hey Ankit ,how you define group cleaning?
6/9/20, 11:04 AM - +91 90133 14441: Removing people who have nothing to do with data science and its sister branches
6/9/20, 11:04 AM - +91 96636 21030: But how will you decide if they are related to it or not?
6/9/20, 11:04 AM - +91 90133 14441: By asking them
6/9/20, 11:04 AM - +91 96055 93304: Iam doing specialization of mathematics of machine learning in coursea
6/9/20, 11:05 AM - +91 90133 14441: See
6/9/20, 11:05 AM - +91 77488 36262: Same pinch. I just completed first week today.
6/9/20, 11:06 AM - +91 96633 11499: Good strategy bro... But it will take a lot of effort asking everyone these questions... And we might end up little less than 20 ppl... I think we should go with the entire population and if anyone is spamming, they can be banned
6/9/20, 11:06 AM - +91 73377 22233: So we have to give our details😱😁
6/9/20, 11:06 AM - +91 77488 36262: Ya you can do that by tagging them and asking are they really into ML, data science and want to discuss things about it or  is this group just a muted group for them.
6/9/20, 11:06 AM - +880 1837-305388: Many of them are learning yet, they Don't have enough knowledge to join you, so may be remove won't be good.
6/9/20, 11:07 AM - +91 77488 36262: We can just ask them from where they are learning how much they have learnt and things like that
6/9/20, 11:08 AM - +91 90133 14441: People who have started the course will know atleast syllabus of the course
6/9/20, 11:08 AM - +91 6239 750 634: Before this group was only of people coursera student but after some time many students join through invitation link
6/9/20, 11:08 AM - +91 90133 14441: Even if they have audit the course they know the basic syllabus
6/9/20, 11:09 AM - +91 6239 750 634: Thier are around 169 people in the group
6/9/20, 11:09 AM - +91 6239 750 634: Point
6/9/20, 11:09 AM - +91 90133 14441: Like i said nominate members look out
6/9/20, 11:09 AM - +91 96633 11499: I think Ankit will soon be nominated as the Admin to perform the background verification 🤣
6/9/20, 11:09 AM - +91 77488 36262: 😂
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 90133 14441: Haha
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - Chirag: How about creating an ml program to see who all are active and who are non active members?😂
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 96633 11499: Good one
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 73377 22233: 😁👍🏻
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 96633 11499: We will all learn
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - Chirag: This way we'll get to practice
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 96633 11499: Classification
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 73377 22233: Who doesn't know ML ??
6/9/20, 11:10 AM - +91 77488 36262: That's a nice idea
6/9/20, 11:11 AM - +91 90133 14441: Knn classification
6/9/20, 11:11 AM - +91 96055 93304: I completed first course and started second course (week 3)
6/9/20, 11:11 AM - Chirag: You can try analysing the data using basic stats also
6/9/20, 11:12 AM - +91 6239 750 634: I thought this group is about data science now it's become more ML group
6/9/20, 11:12 AM - Chirag: Like how many messages have someone sent
6/9/20, 11:12 AM - Chirag: Or at what times is the group most active
6/9/20, 11:12 AM - +234 813 156 6010: 👍
6/9/20, 11:13 AM - Chirag: There's A lot of things brother to do without ml
6/9/20, 11:13 AM - +92 333 2873132: A very generous proposition.
It would add credibility to everyone's profile.
6/9/20, 11:13 AM - +91 90133 14441: Its basic ml i think you have to learn classification even if you dont want to do ai
6/9/20, 11:13 AM - Chirag: Yes it would help for sure
6/9/20, 11:14 AM - Chirag: How about creating a github repo, and we all should write code, and add to it
6/9/20, 11:15 AM - +91 77488 36262: That's nice. I enrolled yesterday only.
6/9/20, 11:15 AM - +91 96633 11499: Good idea
6/9/20, 11:15 AM - Chirag: So that everyone can learn different ways to solve a problem
6/9/20, 11:15 AM - +91 6239 750 634: Or simply if anyone spams the group we remove that person rather then filteration
6/9/20, 11:15 AM - +91 96633 11499: Best idea
6/9/20, 11:16 AM - +91 90133 14441: Nice one
6/9/20, 11:16 AM - Chirag: This group's admin already do that
6/9/20, 11:16 AM - +234 807 677 1953: Same here
6/9/20, 11:16 AM - +91 90133 14441: Yup he is good
6/9/20, 11:18 AM - +91 96633 11499: Meanwhile Saurav the owner of this group has created a bot to perform sentiment analysis on our conversations
6/9/20, 11:19 AM - +92 333 2873132: We all want to get the best out of the group. We want to share the knowledge and help each other grow.

The admin make a google form. Ask three questions that will qualify the respondent as:
1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Advanced

After grouping the members into three categories, we can tailor the messages as:
This message is for beginners.
This is advice from an intermediate to a beginner.

This will save time for each group and get the most out of each person by giving time to what suits his level.

What do you suggest?
6/9/20, 11:20 AM - Chirag: It's a really good idea
6/9/20, 11:21 AM - +91 78274 60556: Absolutely Spot On!
A fine balance is important
6/9/20, 11:21 AM - +91 90133 14441: Its good but it how we will divide skills in that way
Programming
Ml
Visualization 
Deeplearning
Analytics
6/9/20, 11:22 AM - +91 90133 14441: NOTE:I am just asking i am not opposing the idea
6/9/20, 11:22 AM - +92 333 2873132: The number of courses/projects can give a good estimate.
6/9/20, 11:22 AM - +233 54 758 7743: I think that will help us create a community both here and on LinkedIn
6/9/20, 11:22 AM - +92 333 2873132: What comes to your mind?
6/9/20, 11:22 AM - +91 77488 36262: And I think people not filling the form would be the inactive ones
