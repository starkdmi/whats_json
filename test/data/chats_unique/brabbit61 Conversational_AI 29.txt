06/11/2018, 12:20 - Divya Hebbar: <Media omitted>
06/11/2018, 12:27 - Jenit Jain: I have no idea
06/11/2018, 12:27 - Jenit Jain: I copied it from sahil
06/11/2018, 12:31 - Divya Hebbar: Ohhhh Oki 
Thanks :)
08/11/2018, 13:19 - Jenit Jain: What was your question
08/11/2018, 13:19 - Jenit Jain: Explain na
08/11/2018, 14:13 - Divya Hebbar: There was 2 parts A and B 
A was normal preemptive priority scheduling 
B was extend the preemptive priority to include aging so for every clock cycle decrement priority of all processes except the currently executing one and those that have priority 0 
(0 is highest priority) 
Once all reach highest priority the system degrades to FCFS
08/11/2018, 14:21 - Jenit Jain: How did you do part B
08/11/2018, 14:24 - Divya Hebbar: You add an aging function and an isMaxPri function to your normal code for preemptive priority
08/11/2018, 14:25 - Divya Hebbar: After selecting the process to execute i.e minimum priority 
Call aging 
Then normally execute 
Check if isMaxPri
I.e of all priorities are 0
If they are then finish executing current process and then call the FCFS function
08/11/2018, 14:26 - Divya Hebbar: The code for preemptive priority is pretty similar to SRTF
08/11/2018, 14:26 - Divya Hebbar: Just check priorities instead of burst times
08/11/2018, 15:11 - Jenit Jain: If all priorities aren't Max then next process is chosen with the lowest priority and the earliest arrival time right
08/11/2018, 15:11 - Divya Hebbar: Yupp
08/11/2018, 15:12 - Divya Hebbar: Well not necessarily earliest arrival time
08/11/2018, 15:12 - Divya Hebbar: Just earlier than current time
08/11/2018, 15:13 - Jenit Jain: Yeah I mean if 2 processes have 0 priority then earliest arrival time right
08/11/2018, 15:15 - Divya Hebbar: Ya
09/11/2018, 08:35 - Jenit Jain: Listen
09/11/2018, 08:35 - Jenit Jain: After how many quants did you have to call the aging function
09/11/2018, 08:36 - Jenit Jain: Just let me know when you'll be free for 5 mins
09/11/2018, 08:36 - Jenit Jain: I'll call
09/11/2018, 09:12 - Divya Hebbar: Not after a time quantum 
You age for every clock cycle
09/11/2018, 09:32 - Jenit Jain: Oh
09/11/2018, 09:32 - Jenit Jain: Okay thanks
09/11/2018, 09:34 - Jenit Jain: Also, you don't need to implement a separate fcfs function right? Because as soon as the all the processes have minimum priority, whenever the priority function is called ,as soon as the first process with 0 priority is found, the process will execute
09/11/2018, 09:34 - Jenit Jain: So all the processes will finish in line.
09/11/2018, 09:34 - Jenit Jain: Which is fcfs
09/11/2018, 09:34 - Jenit Jain: So it's fine right?
09/11/2018, 09:41 - Divya Hebbar: It should be
I implemented a seperate fcfs function tho
09/11/2018, 09:56 - Jenit Jain: Alright thanks
18/11/2018, 10:14 - Jenit Jain: Which oe are you planning to take
18/11/2018, 10:25 - Divya Hebbar: Not sure

Italian and Sanskrit linguistics
18/11/2018, 10:25 - Jenit Jain: Ducking Hell nvm
18/11/2018, 10:25 - Divya Hebbar: Why??
18/11/2018, 10:26 - Jenit Jain: I'm thinking solid state physics or nanoscience üòÇ
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Divya Hebbar: I took a technical oe last time 
It was hell üôà
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Jenit Jain: Matlab man.
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Divya Hebbar: But nanoscience sounds interesting it has a pretty decent course plan
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Jenit Jain: I saw the portion for these and we have already don't 95% from both
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Jenit Jain: A lot of this was done in chem already
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Divya Hebbar: The entire EEE department
18/11/2018, 10:29 - Divya Hebbar: That
18/11/2018, 10:33 - Jenit Jain: Do you know anyone interested in either of these courses. I can't do it alone :/
18/11/2018, 10:56 - Divya Hebbar: I don't think so üôà
I can ask if you want
18/11/2018, 11:00 - Jenit Jain: No-no it's fine

23/03/2019, 22:12 - Divya Hebbar: Oh shit I was supposed to send you pictures I completely forgot sorry

23/03/2019, 22:14 - Divya Hebbar: üòÇüòÇ
23/03/2019, 22:14 - Jenit Jain: Who am I kidding with pictures
23/03/2019, 22:14 - Divya Hebbar: Optimistic
24/03/2019, 23:43 - Jenit Jain: No fucking idea if it is b or c
24/03/2019, 23:43 - Jenit Jain: But mostly c
24/03/2019, 23:44 - Divya Hebbar: Its a really stupid question if the answer is c
24/03/2019, 23:44 - Divya Hebbar: Like you earn 1000 per year 
What's the annual amount
24/03/2019, 23:45 - Jenit Jain: But because they gave interest rate, it creates a doubt
24/03/2019, 23:45 - Jenit Jain: But annual equivalent amount should be c only
24/03/2019, 23:50 - Divya Hebbar: That's what I thought too
24/03/2019, 23:51 - Divya Hebbar: But what kind of question is that
24/03/2019, 23:53 - Jenit Jain: The one we need
24/03/2019, 23:56 - Divya Hebbar: üôà
24/03/2019, 23:57 - Jenit Jain: Can you explain the 18k. Term
25/03/2019, 00:03 - Divya Hebbar: 18k is an infinite annual payment
25/03/2019, 00:03 - Divya Hebbar: The formula for A/i in the CC equation expands to 
A(P/A,i, infinity)
25/03/2019, 00:04 - Divya Hebbar: So 18000/i is the same as finding P given amount A for time t
25/03/2019, 00:04 - Divya Hebbar: Except t is infinity here
25/03/2019, 00:05 - Divya Hebbar: Now once you find P at year 4 you need to bring that to year 0 for present worth
25/03/2019, 00:05 - Divya Hebbar: So (F/P,i,4)
25/03/2019, 00:07 - Jenit Jain: Can't you just frame it as, 
You have to shift the infinite 18k payment by 4 years to the left of the cfd so that it seems that he payments start from year 0, that's why 18k*p/f and then that's basically A, and then you divide by i that I know. So can you say this makes sense too
25/03/2019, 00:10 - Divya Hebbar: Ya I think so
25/03/2019, 00:10 - Jenit Jain: Good luck for the vague exam lollllll
25/03/2019, 00:11 - Divya Hebbar: Thanks 
I think I need it üôà

30/03/2019, 19:49 - Divya Hebbar: K means clustering?

31/03/2019, 07:22 - Jenit Jain: And in the 13th question, in the production S -> a.AB , you have to add the closure elements of A to the item set and the lookahead symbol will be first of B or follow of A only?
31/03/2019, 07:23 - Jenit Jain: And if it is first or B then do we have to put the epsilon in the lookahead symbol for the closure items? It doesn't make sense but I'm asking anyway
31/03/2019, 07:34 - Jenit Jain: And how many states for this one
31/03/2019, 09:19 - Divya Hebbar: Yup
31/03/2019, 09:20 - Divya Hebbar: First of B
31/03/2019, 09:20 - Divya Hebbar: And if first of B is epsilon then it'll be $
31/03/2019, 09:20 - Divya Hebbar: 18states I think
31/03/2019, 09:21 - Divya Hebbar: 0-17
31/03/2019, 09:21 - Jenit Jain: Or 16
31/03/2019, 09:22 - Jenit Jain: Do you remember getting $,c lookahead for few states

02/04/2019, 16:11 - Jenit Jain: 4*4 matrix of letters
02/04/2019, 16:12 - Jenit Jain: Divide it into 4 quadrants and send elements of each quadrant to a process
02/04/2019, 16:12 - Jenit Jain: And then you had to check a small thing
02/04/2019, 16:12 - Jenit Jain: But mainly only sending
02/04/2019, 16:12 - Jenit Jain: Which is what I couldn't do

05/04/2019, 19:11 - Jenit Jain: Will it be$

05/04/2019, 19:34 - Divya Hebbar: If you have 
A -> a.BC , $

22/04/2019, 11:58 - Divya Hebbar: Thankyouuu!
22/04/2019, 13:51 - Jenit Jain: Dude how do you find effective interest rate if pp < cp
22/04/2019, 14:13 - Divya Hebbar: Give me an example I'll tell you
22/04/2019, 14:32 - Jenit Jain: 18% per year when payment period is quarterly
22/04/2019, 14:33 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
22/04/2019, 14:36 - Divya Hebbar: m=1
n=1/4
22/04/2019, 14:37 - Divya Hebbar: No you leave them as it is
22/04/2019, 14:50 - Jenit Jain: So the first one won't have 2 life cycles?
22/04/2019, 14:51 - Divya Hebbar: This is replacement analysis na
22/04/2019, 14:51 - Divya Hebbar: So the first 2 years for the defender will be sunk cost
22/04/2019, 14:51 - Jenit Jain: Yes
22/04/2019, 14:51 - Divya Hebbar: And you draw that cash flow
22/04/2019, 14:52 - Jenit Jain: But at year 4 do you buy the old machine again
22/04/2019, 14:52 - Divya Hebbar: Give me 20mins I'll solve it and send it to you
22/04/2019, 14:52 - Divya Hebbar: Noope

22/04/2019, 21:48 - Jenit Jain: Thanks
22/04/2019, 21:48 - Jenit Jain: What are you doing for the ratios man
22/04/2019, 21:50 - Divya Hebbar: I studied it in the morning
22/04/2019, 21:50 - Divya Hebbar: I don't remember anything now
22/04/2019, 21:50 - Divya Hebbar: R I p
22/04/2019, 21:57 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
22/04/2019, 22:00 - Jenit Jain: Or 18/12
22/04/2019, 22:00 - Jenit Jain: This right
22/04/2019, 22:01 - Divya Hebbar: Ya it'll be this
22/04/2019, 22:01 - Divya Hebbar: Cuz no. Of CPs in one year is 12
22/04/2019, 22:01 - Divya Hebbar: So 1+18/12
22/04/2019, 22:01 - Jenit Jain: Cooolll
22/04/2019, 22:01 - Jenit Jain: Rippppp

22/04/2019, 22:45 - Divya Hebbar: This one I'll do in a while
I haven't done nominal interest yet
22/04/2019, 22:56 - Jenit Jain: Okay cool
22/04/2019, 23:41 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
22/04/2019, 23:41 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
22/04/2019, 23:52 - Divya Hebbar: Debt equity ratio
22/04/2019, 23:52 - Divya Hebbar: The denominator
22/04/2019, 23:52 - Jenit Jain: Only equity is counted
22/04/2019, 23:52 - Jenit Jain: So no 2000
22/04/2019, 23:53 - Divya Hebbar: Equity= shares + preference capital+reserves
22/04/2019, 23:53 - Divya Hebbar: No you count preference capital also
22/04/2019, 23:53 - Jenit Jain: My sister said that preference capital is included only if you're teacher has said so
22/04/2019, 23:53 - Jenit Jain: So I guess include that too
22/04/2019, 23:53 - Divya Hebbar: The book said so
22/04/2019, 23:54 - Jenit Jain: Smh
22/04/2019, 23:54 - Divya Hebbar: So I guess ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄüôà
22/04/2019, 23:55 - Divya Hebbar: How did you calculate interest coverage ratio?
22/04/2019, 23:56 - Jenit Jain: Yes because ebit - interest = ebt
22/04/2019, 23:56 - Jenit Jain: And ebt is given
22/04/2019, 23:56 - Divya Hebbar: Isn't it just 
EBT/interest
22/04/2019, 23:57 - Jenit Jain: Ebit
22/04/2019, 23:57 - Jenit Jain: Not ebt
22/04/2019, 23:57 - Divya Hebbar: Ya this sorry
22/04/2019, 23:57 - Divya Hebbar: How do you get interest then?
22/04/2019, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: Interest paid for the mortgage
22/04/2019, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: Is the denom
22/04/2019, 23:58 - Divya Hebbar: Ohhh
22/04/2019, 23:58 - Divya Hebbar: Okiii
22/04/2019, 23:58 - Divya Hebbar: Thanks frenn
22/04/2019, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: :)
23/04/2019, 00:00 - Divya Hebbar: In stock turnover ratio
23/04/2019, 00:00 - Divya Hebbar: The numerator won't it be cost of goods sold and not net sales?
23/04/2019, 00:00 - Jenit Jain: Bhai a CA solved these questions. I'm just accepting it at this point
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Divya Hebbar: I'll also accept
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Divya Hebbar: Idk what's happening
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Divya Hebbar: I miss engineering :c
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Jenit Jain: To use cost of good you also need opening stock which isn't giving so that's why using net sales/ closing inventory
23/04/2019, 00:02 - Divya Hebbar: Ohh okayy
23/04/2019, 00:09 - Divya Hebbar: <Media omitted>
23/04/2019, 00:09 - Divya Hebbar: ^i think that's how you do it
23/04/2019, 00:13 - Jenit Jain: Yep cool
23/04/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: Send me any capital recovery sum which has recurring and non recurring calculations
23/04/2019, 11:50 - Divya Hebbar: Capitalized cost you mean?
23/04/2019, 11:50 - Jenit Jain: Yes yes sorry
23/04/2019, 11:50 - Divya Hebbar: <Media omitted>
23/04/2019, 11:50 - Divya Hebbar: <Media omitted>
23/04/2019, 11:51 - Divya Hebbar: There's 2 types
23/04/2019, 11:55 - Jenit Jain: Yep thankss
23/04/2019, 12:08 - Divya Hebbar: üôÉ
24/04/2019, 16:13 - Jenit Jain: If 2 non terminals that's are not starting symbols are in deadlock while finding the follow set then we just add $ to both of them right?
24/04/2019, 16:14 - Jenit Jain: X -> YZ
Y-> a| epsilon
Z -> b
24/04/2019, 16:14 - Jenit Jain: Will first(X) contain epsilong
25/04/2019, 02:43 - Divya Hebbar: Nope
25/04/2019, 02:43 - Divya Hebbar: First(X) ={a,b}
25/04/2019, 02:44 - Divya Hebbar: Add dollar to one of them to break out of the loop and then continue as you would normally
25/04/2019, 08:22 - Jenit Jain: only one?
25/04/2019, 08:22 - Jenit Jain: and which chapter do we have from flex oreilly
25/04/2019, 09:30 - Divya Hebbar: The first 3 I think
25/04/2019, 09:39 - Jenit Jain: Fuck
25/04/2019, 12:29 - Jenit Jain: Do you understand the instruction count part
25/04/2019, 12:29 - Jenit Jain: The associated cost
25/04/2019, 12:33 - Divya Hebbar: Count the no. Of memory accesses
25/04/2019, 12:33 - Divya Hebbar: Add one for each memory access
25/04/2019, 12:33 - Jenit Jain: And one for storing too right
25/04/2019, 12:34 - Divya Hebbar: Ya store is 1 I think

26/04/2019, 09:01 - Divya Hebbar: Thanks frennn üíôüíô
26/04/2019, 20:35 - Jenit Jain: In cuda arrays are stored in local memory right
26/04/2019, 20:35 - Jenit Jain: Which is unique for every thread
26/04/2019, 20:35 - Jenit Jain: Where is this local memory? It's not shown in the diagram
26/04/2019, 21:26 - Divya Hebbar: Reg and shared memory are local
26/04/2019, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: Accha it's stored in global only I checked
26/04/2019, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: Also
26/04/2019, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: Did you pvm
26/04/2019, 21:36 - Divya Hebbar: Sort of

26/04/2019, 21:39 - Divya Hebbar: ‚òπ
26/04/2019, 21:40 - Divya Hebbar: Why macha
26/04/2019, 21:40 - Divya Hebbar: I didn't need the reminder
26/04/2019, 22:11 - Jenit Jain: aww
26/04/2019, 22:11 - Jenit Jain: i'll get you an ice cream tomorrow
26/04/2019, 22:12 - Divya Hebbar: üíô
29/04/2019, 15:53 - Jenit Jain: Dude what to do in the 12tg chapter
29/04/2019, 15:53 - Jenit Jain: Are you reading everything
29/04/2019, 15:53 - Jenit Jain: And are your notes enough for that chapter
29/04/2019, 16:02 - Divya Hebbar: It's only .1 .2 .5 .6
29/04/2019, 16:02 - Divya Hebbar: I don't think my notes are even there for that chapter
29/04/2019, 16:03 - Divya Hebbar: Slides possible
29/04/2019, 16:06 - Jenit Jain: Wowwwww
29/04/2019, 16:06 - Jenit Jain: Just spent hours doing .3 .4
29/04/2019, 16:06 - Jenit Jain: Thanks ks
29/04/2019, 16:06 - Jenit Jain: Thankss
29/04/2019, 16:16 - Divya Hebbar: Ayyyy ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
29/04/2019, 16:58 - Jenit Jain: stuff is basically a part of something and retains the same intrinsic properties even when subdivided. Right? and what about Things
29/04/2019, 17:32 - Divya Hebbar: Which chapter is stuff and things? üôàüôà
29/04/2019, 17:32 - Jenit Jain: 12
29/04/2019, 17:34 - Divya Hebbar: I can't find iiit
29/04/2019, 17:34 - Divya Hebbar: Deth
29/04/2019, 17:35 - Jenit Jain: 12.2.3
29/04/2019, 17:38 - Divya Hebbar: Okay ya so stuff basically can be subdivided infinitely and still retains the same properties as the whole so you can't identify individuals
29/04/2019, 17:39 - Divya Hebbar: And things are basically anything you can describe with count nouns
29/04/2019, 17:39 - Divya Hebbar: Stuff you can't divide into distinct objects 
Things you can
29/04/2019, 17:40 - Divya Hebbar: Things are countable and dividing it doesn't give you 2 of the thing
29/04/2019, 17:40 - Divya Hebbar: Any part of "stuff" is also stuff
29/04/2019, 17:44 - Jenit Jain: give examples of things
29/04/2019, 17:44 - Jenit Jain: stuff i understoof
29/04/2019, 17:47 - Divya Hebbar: Aardvark?
29/04/2019, 17:47 - Divya Hebbar: Books
29/04/2019, 17:47 - Divya Hebbar: Anything you can count
29/04/2019, 17:47 - Jenit Jain: accha okay thanksss
29/04/2019, 17:48 - Divya Hebbar: üôÉ
29/04/2019, 18:13 - Jenit Jain: dude whats the difference between graph and tree search
29/04/2019, 18:13 - Jenit Jain: in a tree search it traversing can get stuck in a loop but in graph search we use explored states ka set so it doesnt go in that infinite loop?
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Divya Hebbar: Yup
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Divya Hebbar: That
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: cool thankss
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Divya Hebbar: Tree only has frontier 
Graph has frontier and explored
29/04/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: shit man should have studied yesterday
29/04/2019, 18:15 - Divya Hebbar: ++ to that
29/04/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: on A* after reaching a goal state do we check if other goal states can be reached in lesser distance?
29/04/2019, 18:16 - Jenit Jain: or once if we get the answer thenn thats that
29/04/2019, 18:19 - Divya Hebbar: I think you look to see if there are more optimal ways
29/04/2019, 18:19 - Divya Hebbar: Cuz I remember reading that it might expand a few nodes on the goal contour
29/04/2019, 18:19 - Divya Hebbar: Before deciding the final solution
29/04/2019, 18:19 - Divya Hebbar: But I think practically it should be fine if you stop at the first solution
29/04/2019, 18:23 - Jenit Jain: What do you mean on goal contours
29/04/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: bro isnt the dfs just S A G1
29/04/2019, 18:29 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
29/04/2019, 18:29 - Jenit Jain: this is the solution i have but its wrong right?
29/04/2019, 18:39 - Divya Hebbar: This is wrong
29/04/2019, 18:39 - Divya Hebbar: I think they've switched DFS and bfs
29/04/2019, 18:46 - Jenit Jain: It's not even for that lol
29/04/2019, 18:46 - Jenit Jain: .
29/04/2019, 18:47 - Divya Hebbar: Ya DFS is definitely S A G1
29/04/2019, 18:47 - Jenit Jain: See from your notes I'm doing full propositional logic and Fol
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Should I do chapter 8 from the text
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Divya Hebbar: Should be enough
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Great
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Divya Hebbar: What is chapter 8?
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: This js fol only
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Jenit Jain: Knowledge engineering
29/04/2019, 18:48 - Divya Hebbar: 8 is FOL
29/04/2019, 18:49 - Divya Hebbar: That they'll mostly ask only questions not too much theory anyway
29/04/2019, 18:49 - Jenit Jain: So this?
29/04/2019, 18:49 - Divya Hebbar: Yup
30/04/2019, 08:19 - Jenit Jain: In the water jug problem, you just try to get the answer through intuition through the graph right
30/04/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: How was it üôàüôàüôà
30/04/2019, 17:11 - Divya Hebbar: It wasn't so bad
