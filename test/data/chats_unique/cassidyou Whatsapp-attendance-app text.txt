2/21/22, 5:53 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Thanks
2/21/22, 7:35 AM - Omaka Samuel: Good morning.
Please, don't ask question for what your guide has not thought you yet.
Ask for what you don't understand.

So you won't be faster than your guide.

If you wish to be faster, then take your guide fast.

Anything you cannot achieve after your HTML, you are free to ask.

But I believe there are lots of things to learn if you finish your guide.
2/21/22, 7:37 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Meanwhile, I want to see the report of what every other persons have done so far, this is one week already*

2/22/22, 11:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: But I have an issue with all your reports so far.
2/22/22, 11:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Don't learn with a project in mind.
2/22/22, 11:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: I saw someone doing CAC stuff
2/22/22, 11:53 PM - Omaka Samuel: For now, don't do anything outside the code written in your learning curriculum
2/22/22, 11:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: I was expecting to see the codes you wrote which shows all the things they taught in all the chapters
2/22/22, 11:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: *So I have not accept and approved your reports*
2/22/22, 11:55 PM - Omaka Samuel: If I see your report, I should be able to see the sequencial topics from chapter 1 to where you stopped
2/22/22, 11:55 PM - Omaka Samuel: I should be able to see the codes you practiced without skipping any chapter
2/22/22, 11:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: So, everyone should start afresh
2/22/22, 11:56 PM - 0703 625 3823: Ok boss
2/22/22, 11:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: *For those who has refused to submit, your ejection is knocking at your door*
2/23/22, 12:00 AM - Omaka Samuel: You all can install *FirrShot Chrome Extension* on your chrome to help you capture your entire full page and drop as document file here.

2/23/22, 6:10 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Sir please are we to write exactly the same code written in the guide without using our own words or examples?
2/23/22, 8:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: You can use your own words if you wish, but same code
2/23/22, 8:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: All the code must be fully represented in your report.
2/23/22, 8:18 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
2/23/22, 10:10 AM - 0703 625 3823: <Media omitted>

2/23/22, 10:24 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Notice*
1. Screenshot your reports, don't snap your screen.
2. *You are no longer expected to use your own words in practicing what is in your material, you are now expected to write exactly what is written.*
So I am expecting everyone's work to be the same.
3. I am giving you a grace period of Friday to report up to *HTM Colors* in your learning materials.
So you are expected to report everything from *Introduction* to *HTML Colors*.

Adhere to every instructions.

Thank you.

How do we now improve on what is thought?
2/23/22, 12:47 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Taught*
2/23/22, 12:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: I wouldn't want you to be distracted from the basic knowledge.
Most of you will go and start doing one big project and get stuck.

Time is coming when you'll be left to create and innovate.
2/23/22, 12:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: So adhere to this for now.
2/23/22, 12:50 PM - Omaka Samuel: At this Stage, what you are doing is not supposed to make sense
2/23/22, 12:50 PM - Omaka Samuel: What you should focus on is being able to implement what is taught.

2/25/22, 12:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: Don't copy codes. I stressed it.
You become a programmer by typing codes.
2/25/22, 12:02 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
2/25/22, 12:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: Where are your images.

If you don't learn to be accurate, it will catch up with you when you start JavaScript and PHP. 
Because a little thing will spoil everything
2/25/22, 12:30 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
2/25/22, 12:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: I hope every other person who has determined not to submit before midnight, is ready to leave us from midnight?

2/26/22, 10:17 AM - Omaka Samuel: Zip the folder

2/26/22, 10:30 AM - Omaka Samuel: You are supposed to copy your image from your system to your folder
2/26/22, 10:31 AM - Omaka Samuel: So that if you're sending your project to another, it will follow the folder.
2/26/22, 10:31 AM - 0703 625 3823: Ok Sir
Let work on it
2/26/22, 10:31 AM - 0703 625 3823: Ok sir
2/26/22, 10:32 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
2/26/22, 10:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: Okay. I see. They used it to illustrate typographical error in image.
2/26/22, 10:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: But ensure you move the images to your folder.
2/26/22, 10:36 AM - 0703 625 3823: Exactly sir
2/26/22, 10:39 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
2/26/22, 10:40 AM - 0703 625 3823: I noticed the HTML file is no longer on the folder I created.
Please do I need to unzip the folder before I can be able to make the corrections?
2/26/22, 10:40 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
2/26/22, 10:43 AM - 0703 625 3823: Taking notes of my mistakes
2/26/22, 10:43 AM - 0703 625 3823: This has been sorted out
2/26/22, 10:47 AM - Omaka Samuel: You had less typographical errors.
Are you sure you didn't copy and paste?
2/26/22, 10:48 AM - Omaka Samuel: Anybody who copy and paste, nemesis will catch up with them.
2/26/22, 10:48 AM - Omaka Samuel: The person will be struggling while others become experts.
2/26/22, 10:50 AM - 0703 625 3823: I copied the colors due to time so as to meet up with the timing sir
2/26/22, 10:52 AM - Omaka Samuel: You're cheating on yourself.
2/26/22, 10:53 AM - 0703 625 3823: Will take corrections
2/26/22, 10:55 AM - 0703 625 3823: It's won't repeat itself again

The image in W3school is also pointing to the system
You can give me guidelines on how to revert it. I have tried but couldn't 

Thank you
2/27/22, 7:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: For every image, video or any media file they used, download it and Dave in your project folder.
2/27/22, 7:42 AM - Omaka Samuel: Then in your own source, what you'll have is *src="img_girl.jpg"*
2/27/22, 9:23 PM - 0703 625 3823: Good Evening Sir
Have been inputting src="img_girl.jpg" bit the picture doesn't display
2/27/22, 11:13 PM - Omaka Samuel: Download the *img_girl.jpg* image and place in your project folder before it will display

3/1/22, 6:30 PM - Anthony Tutapis: <Media omitted>
3/1/22, 6:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: First of all.
Why is your project named *index_part_2*
3/1/22, 6:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: You are expected to name in relative to what the project represent
3/1/22, 6:32 PM - Omaka Samuel: In this case, we are using something related to web tutorial
3/1/22, 6:32 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK, I'm to continue from the former one we submitted?
3/1/22, 6:33 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Because that's where I'm having issue with
3/1/22, 6:33 PM - Anthony Tutapis: After CSS fonts, when I add the code for CSS Border, it won't display correctly
3/1/22, 6:33 PM - Omaka Samuel: Continue from the previous one.

3/3/22, 10:55 AM - Omaka Samuel: Funny enough, if you're employed here, you will be damn committed
3/3/22, 10:55 AM - Omaka Samuel: How about staying committed to this learning
3/3/22, 10:55 AM - Omaka Samuel: It's predictable
3/3/22, 11:46 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that compensation for a Supervisory office. It is well.
Thanks for sharing Sir.
I will submit my report tomorrow

3/4/22, 12:42 AM - +234 813 340 9143: Sir, I have a question as regards images
3/4/22, 12:42 AM - +234 813 340 9143: HTML images
3/4/22, 12:44 AM - +234 813 340 9143: I am trying to figure it out on my own but I will also appreciate if anyone or the instructor can explain it properly. That img tag. Especially the pathway thing.
3/4/22, 12:44 AM - +234 813 340 9143: Do we just get images from anywhere to put in our website or there are specific places to get them?
3/4/22, 12:45 AM - +234 813 340 9143: Also the file pathway thing, how do we figure it out, especially when we're getting images from another server
3/4/22, 12:46 AM - +234 813 340 9143: It's midnight so I get that most of us are asleep. Please whenever you can, I will appreciate some clarification.
3/4/22, 7:56 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: <Media omitted>
3/4/22, 8:03 AM - Omaka Samuel: I guess you're building exactly what is on w3schools. So wherever they used image, save that image and put in your project folder.
3/4/22, 8:05 AM - Omaka Samuel: If your project folder is named *web_tutorial*
And your image *house.jpg* is placed inside the web_tutorial folder, then the src should be *src="house.jpg"*
3/4/22, 8:07 AM - Omaka Samuel: However, it is always advisable to place all your images in one folder titled *images* or *img*
3/4/22, 8:08 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
3/4/22, 8:08 AM - Omaka Samuel: This is a good coding ethics
3/4/22, 8:09 AM - Omaka Samuel: So if my *house.jpg* is placed inside *images*
3/4/22, 8:09 AM - Omaka Samuel: My source will be *src="images/house.jpg"*
3/4/22, 8:09 AM - Omaka Samuel: I do hope this is clear
3/4/22, 8:10 AM - +234 813 340 9143: Yes. I already did create the image folder.
3/4/22, 8:10 AM - Omaka Samuel: But this is a different project from the one you're doing
3/4/22, 8:10 AM - Omaka Samuel: Cool
3/4/22, 8:10 AM - +234 813 340 9143: Thank you for your explanation.
3/4/22, 8:11 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2347067521473 already had some level of knowledge in HTML and CSS

3/4/22, 8:32 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Yes I do understand
3/4/22, 8:33 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I'll try learn bootstrap before the end of next week and redo it again later in the week
3/4/22, 8:34 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: But I would want another challenge, I'll fix this one and do the other
3/4/22, 8:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: Instead of another challenge, I will want you to start your Bootstrap tutorial immediately
3/4/22, 8:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: Once you're done you will have multiple assignments.

3/4/22, 11:25 PM - +234 813 340 9143: I did. I think my folder is messing up.

3/4/22, 11:27 PM - +234 813 340 9143: I just discovered I made an error. I zipped a wrong file

3/5/22, 7:17 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Good morning everyone*
I have noticed that whenever I correct someone, others skip it.
The reason why I correct openly is for others not to repeat same mistake.
3/5/22, 7:18 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348133409143 what is *tulapis*?
Why did you name your project that?
3/5/22, 7:18 AM - Omaka Samuel: What relationship does it have with your project?
3/5/22, 7:19 AM - +234 813 340 9143: I'll correct it at once
3/5/22, 7:22 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348137615014 you're leaving us.
You have refused to submit your report for 2 consecutive weeks.
3/6/22, 6:12 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348137615014 can you tell us why you have never submitted your report?
3/6/22, 6:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: Guys, we will be using Monday night to have a recap of what we have done so far. It will be a Zoom meeting.
3/6/22, 6:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: No one should be absent 8pm is the time.
3/6/22, 6:13 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Okay
3/6/22, 6:37 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Good morning Instructor and my colleagues,
Dear Sir @2347030537705  I sincerely appreciate your patience with me. 
Please forgive me for the lackadaisical attitude I seem to portray Sir,  But it is not so Sir.
 Sincerely speaking Sir, my windows restarted and I lost some of my files including my sublime text 3, WinRAR and browser (which I got from a friend, since efforts to download directly from net proved abortive).
I tried downloading and reinstalling afresh but couldn't. Last night I was able to get them back. All these coupled with some constraints including some environmental factors resulted in the delay Sir.
I will send it in today Sir.
I felt ashamed of having to make excuses over and over again, hence I was making efforts on my own to report without having to justify my actions.
I really appreciate your patience Sir and it means a lot to me.
Thank you Sir. 
Thanks Colleagues
3/6/22, 6:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: Okay
3/6/22, 6:43 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªThank you Sir

3/7/22, 6:26 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2347036253823  for every new code they write, you have to continue in your *body*. Except it is specified that it is found in the head.

3/7/22, 6:35 AM - Omaka Samuel: I know you all might be busy, or have a tired day. 
I too am having a tired day already. I stayed awake at night to work, and I will be working from now till night with some breaks.
3/7/22, 6:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: You're not paying for this, still I will be present to help you all.
3/7/22, 6:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: If you refuse to be present, I will know how ungrateful you are towards this commitment I am giving
3/7/22, 6:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Do have a lovely day ahead*.üëç
3/7/22, 6:37 AM - Anthony Tutapis: You too
3/7/22, 6:46 AM - 0703 625 3823: Good morning Boss
Thank you very much for the corrections
I have been patiently waiting for this
I thought we had to start it assignment on the material with html code.
In the process I had a very big challenge. I typed in a code that affected all other write-ups and I couldn't correct it despite taking time to know where the error is from.
A code changed all the font-color to Red while the all paragraphs had to be in a border 
It's a very big challenge for me
3/7/22, 6:47 AM - Omaka Samuel: Look at how to prevent errors at this stage. Learn how to type what you see without mistakes
3/7/22, 6:47 AM - Omaka Samuel: If you skip anything, it might affect everything
3/7/22, 6:48 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: I'm sorry Sir
3/7/22, 6:49 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Noted Sir
3/7/22, 6:49 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
3/7/22, 6:50 AM - 0703 625 3823: Ok Boss
I tried to be careful though I had to review the "try it yourself" assignments which I realized I had all codes typed but I could take out this errors
3/7/22, 6:53 AM - Omaka Samuel: You missed something.
3/7/22, 6:53 AM - Omaka Samuel: If you typed exactly, you get same result
3/7/22, 6:55 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Good morning Mr Omaka, what @2347036253823 is saying is that once we add a style between the <head></head>, it affects all other codes we have written so far and alter its display in the browser
3/7/22, 6:55 AM - 0703 625 3823: Ok Boss
3/7/22, 6:55 AM - Anthony Tutapis: I witnessed the same
3/7/22, 6:55 AM - Anthony Tutapis: All code was typed correctly as in the model
3/7/22, 6:56 AM - 0703 625 3823: Yes bro
3/7/22, 6:56 AM - Anthony Tutapis: But since the style is to be in the head, and we have only one head, it automatically affects any code with the style declared
3/7/22, 6:58 AM - Anthony Tutapis: For example, we have a paragraph earlier in the html code without border or padding, if in an example in another topic has a code to add border and padding via style between the head, it automatically adds border and padding to all the paragraphs
3/7/22, 6:59 AM - 0703 625 3823: Exactly @ Tony
3/7/22, 7:00 AM - Omaka Samuel: Okay.
3/7/22, 7:00 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Like the horizontal list with css messed up the output of the results of ordered and unordered html list, when styled horizontally
3/7/22, 7:00 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Maybe if there's a way to add style and define exactly where it should affect
3/7/22, 7:01 AM - Omaka Samuel: Please allow it affect everything for now.
3/7/22, 7:01 AM - Omaka Samuel: Instead if doing the wrong thing
3/7/22, 7:01 AM - Anthony Tutapis: It will OK unless we haven't gotten there yet
3/7/22, 7:01 AM - Omaka Samuel: What he did is not a html document
3/7/22, 7:02 AM - Anthony Tutapis: I understand the one head, html, body you pointed out earlier
3/7/22, 7:02 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Thanks
3/7/22, 7:06 AM - 0703 625 3823: I understand Boss
Will effect my corrections
Thank you very much Boss

3/11/22, 11:48 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Sir, I also asked some questions with comments on things I don't understand so it'll be cool if you could look into it
3/12/22, 12:05 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Then another thing is I couldn't complete to where you asked me to reach, if was too much for new to cover, I tried to finish it but I just couldn't
3/12/22, 12:05 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Your asked I stop at flex but I stopped at nav

3/15/22, 6:52 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
3/15/22, 6:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: Next time you have to ask your questions here and not in your code. The aim is to help others learn openly here.
3/15/22, 6:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: abbr is used to abbreviate some words
3/15/22, 6:55 AM - Omaka Samuel: If World Health Organization is abbreviated to WHO, only WHO will be displayed. 
When WHO is hovered on, World Health Organization will display like a tooltip
3/15/22, 6:58 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
3/15/22, 6:59 AM - Omaka Samuel: The aim is to help you observe the difference, so if it takes repeating the table, do so.

3/15/22, 10:03 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Good morning Mr Omaka
3/15/22, 10:05 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Please what's the difference between <input type="submit" >

And
<input type="submit" value="Submit" >
3/15/22, 10:05 AM - Anthony Tutapis: This message was deleted
3/15/22, 10:05 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Both are been used in the model
3/15/22, 10:18 AM - Omaka Samuel: Both are submit buttons.
However, value defines the text that should be written on the button.

The first one at default has *Submit* text on the button.

But if you want to change the default text, then you specify it with the value attribute.
E.g value="Register Now"
3/15/22, 10:20 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK thanks alot
3/15/22, 11:12 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Please what's the difference between <br><br>

And 

<br>
As used in <form></form> in the model
3/15/22, 11:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: <br> is break.
How many times you use it is how many breaks you'll have
3/15/22, 11:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: Break in terms of new line
3/15/22, 11:14 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
3/17/22, 1:41 PM - Omaka Samuel: Good afternoon gentlemen.
3/17/22, 1:42 PM - Omaka Samuel: Just reminding you that tomorrow is Friday

3/23/22, 10:09 PM - Omaka Samuel: Good evening everyone
3/23/22, 10:09 PM - Omaka Samuel: I want to use this medium to wake you up
3/23/22, 10:10 PM - Omaka Samuel: To as many as are learning by "push and start"
3/23/22, 10:10 PM - Omaka Samuel: This could be the thing that will change your life.
3/23/22, 10:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: I've become busy with client job recently.
The jobs are becoming too much to me to handle
3/23/22, 10:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: This is why I believed in you and your long learning process
3/23/22, 10:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: This is about the future and not now.
3/23/22, 10:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: Anything you have to input to get this, do it
3/23/22, 10:12 PM - Omaka Samuel: If you decide not to take your learning extremely serious, you are cheating on yourself and on the opportunities you are praying for.
3/23/22, 10:14 PM - Omaka Samuel: I want to see that person or group of persons who are going extra mile to prove they understand this movement.
3/23/22, 10:14 PM - Omaka Samuel: Don't even let anything distract you, not even your job.
3/23/22, 10:15 PM - Omaka Samuel: If we all are satisfied with the jobs we currently have now, we won't be pushing to learn something new.
3/23/22, 10:16 PM - Omaka Samuel: You don't need special skill than being diligent in what we're doing here.
3/23/22, 10:17 PM - Omaka Samuel: Last year what you're learning made me to start earning more than a university professor in Nigeria, from my room.
3/23/22, 10:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: And this year I want 10X financial result.
3/23/22, 10:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: Wake up.
You've got your material.
Learn, ask questions here and drop your progress report without anyone pushing you.
3/23/22, 10:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: Peaceüôèüèæ
3/23/22, 10:37 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Thank you Sir...
3/23/22, 10:37 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Thank you sir
I have to personally apologize for not submitting last week
3/24/22, 5:05 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Thank you
3/24/22, 9:47 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Good morning Instructor and Colleagues,
Please I want to know the difference in the application of:
Padding
Margin
Border
3/24/22, 9:49 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Also,
I need explanation on difference and application of 
px and % as it concerns width, height, margin, padding, border.
3/24/22, 9:50 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
3/24/22, 9:50 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Finally please,
As a learner, do I have to try different value of px or % until I get what I want or the px and % already have defined ranges that I can get familiar with?
3/24/22, 9:52 AM - Omaka Samuel: % is in relative to whatever screen size. 100% is 100% of whatever screen size.
3/24/22, 9:52 AM - Omaka Samuel: Pixels (px) is the unit of measurement of computer screen
3/24/22, 9:53 AM - Omaka Samuel: So 100px is a defined area of a screen
3/24/22, 9:53 AM - Omaka Samuel: 100px is the same width in all screen size
3/24/22, 9:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: But 100% will not give you the same, because % is in relative to the screen size.
3/24/22, 9:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: You'll understand it more later.
3/24/22, 9:55 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Thank you for your response Sir
3/24/22, 9:56 AM - Omaka Samuel: Border is the line surrounding a container
3/24/22, 9:57 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: By relative to screen size, do you imply that once I use % it fits automatically to the size of the screen upon which the page is open( whether PC or phone)?
3/24/22, 10:04 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: For example sir
 I have <ul>
*Contact About  Products*
What adjust them as follows:
1. Upwards towards the top of the screen
2.Downwards
3. More Spacing in between the text
4. Move the <ul> to the right of the screen
5. Move the <ul> to the right of the screen
3/24/22, 10:06 AM - Omaka Samuel: Please, can you continue with your tutorial? You will learn all these in the process.
3/24/22, 10:06 AM - Omaka Samuel: That's CSS.
3/24/22, 10:07 AM - Omaka Samuel: Are you in CSS already?
3/24/22, 10:07 AM - Omaka Samuel: If yes, then continue the topics, you'll get everything
3/24/22, 10:10 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: I'm almost through with the basics of html, so I'm trying to apply little CSS on it, just to see my progress
3/24/22, 10:10 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: I will stick to this Sir. Thanks
3/24/22, 10:22 AM - Omaka Samuel: Great
3/24/22, 10:23 AM - Omaka Samuel: I hope you didn't jump to CSS
3/24/22, 10:24 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Smiles... I only jump in and out
3/24/22, 10:24 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: But didn't leave html
3/24/22, 10:24 AM - Omaka Samuel: Never try it
3/24/22, 10:25 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Ok Sir
3/24/22, 10:28 AM - Omaka Samuel: So that you will not start asking questions that looks like you're faster than your material
3/24/22, 10:36 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Ok Sir.
Just that sometimes doing that gives me better understanding of the HTML I'm learning
3/24/22, 10:37 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Especially in the aspect of tags
3/26/22, 8:00 AM - Omaka Samuel: Hello, good morning everyone.

3/29/22, 11:25 AM - Anthony Tutapis: I have finished with html section, can I start CSS on a new file to add visualisation of the output?
3/29/22, 11:26 AM - Anthony Tutapis: The one I tried writing in the html is not showing everything I I'm supposed to get even when the code are correct
3/29/22, 11:26 AM - Omaka Samuel: Do you mean on a new HTML file?
3/29/22, 11:26 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Yes
3/29/22, 11:26 AM - Omaka Samuel: Start a fresh folder.
Start from chapter one of CSS. Do what they did...
3/29/22, 11:27 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
3/29/22, 11:27 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Thank you
3/29/22, 11:27 AM - Omaka Samuel: You're welcome
3/29/22, 11:27 AM - Omaka Samuel: You'll start intense projects after Bootstrap
3/29/22, 11:27 AM - Omaka Samuel: Bootstrap is after CSS
3/29/22, 11:27 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir

3/30/22, 2:43 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I'm not
3/30/22, 2:43 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Good afternoon sir
3/30/22, 2:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: üëç
3/30/22, 2:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: A closed mouth they say is a closed destiny.
3/30/22, 2:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: Don't let us "Left you behind" ooo
3/30/22, 2:45 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK
3/30/22, 4:03 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Good afternoon everyone
3/30/22, 4:05 PM - Omaka Samuel: Good afternoon
3/30/22, 4:06 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Good day Sir
3/31/22, 7:57 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Good morning everyone
3/31/22, 7:57 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: <Media omitted>
3/31/22, 7:59 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: First is, how do I make that image grow so that the words don't take up that much space?
The second is, I've been trying to make the "UI/UX DESIGN" bold but I can't seem to find a class that do that and still maintain the big text, how do I do it?
3/31/22, 8:00 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I've also been trying to include my custom css but it's not reflecting on the page, which is why the color isn't exactly as the one you gave me previously
3/31/22, 8:02 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: <Media omitted>
3/31/22, 8:03 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: These are challenges had with this project
I hope to hear from you, thank you and have a great day
3/31/22, 8:09 AM - Omaka Samuel: Good morning
3/31/22, 8:12 AM - Omaka Samuel: You said you're done with Bootstrap. Did you study abroad *Bootstrap Grid*?
Bootstrap Grid will help you define the responsive layout before adding contents to the layout.
The text area could take 5 columns while the image take 7 columns.

Secondly, when using Bootstrap and you don't see exact class to do a design, revert to your CSS.
3/31/22, 8:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: Share a screenshot of where you linked your external CSS.
3/31/22, 8:13 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Ok, i just wanted to flex to do it
3/31/22, 8:14 AM - Omaka Samuel: You're stressing yourself when there is Bootstrap
3/31/22, 8:14 AM - Omaka Samuel: Bootstrap Grid is the most powerful classes for responsiveness.
3/31/22, 8:16 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Ok
3/31/22, 8:16 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I'll do that
3/31/22, 8:16 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: <Media omitted>
3/31/22, 8:16 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Where I linked my external css
3/31/22, 8:17 AM - Omaka Samuel: Screenshot your project folder.

3/31/22, 8:27 AM - Omaka Samuel: Send your project

4/1/22, 7:56 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Good morning everyone
Please sir, I would like you to look at this code and tell me how to make it cleaner and better
4/1/22, 7:57 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I couldn't get some important stuff to work from my custom css
4/1/22, 7:57 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I don't know why and how I can do it
I've tried everything I know so I just used inline
4/1/22, 7:58 AM - Omaka Samuel: What exactly are you styling that not working?
4/1/22, 7:58 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: In my nav bar, I left one without the inline style but with a class to show what I actually meant
4/1/22, 7:58 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Trying to make the color a little purple
4/1/22, 7:58 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Especially in the nav bar
4/1/22, 7:59 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: If I add a class to make it purple, it won't reflect on the words unless I remove "navbar-light"
But then if i remove it, my toggler won't show, I tried adding color to it but it's not working
4/1/22, 8:00 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: When I leave it, the cm class I added to help with the color on the nav won't reflect

4/9/22, 7:35 AM - Omaka Samuel: If you didn't miss any tag, your code will format automatically. But it won't push any code to next like, just indentation.
4/9/22, 7:37 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 I hope you're aware JavaScript date and time uses the user system date. So if their phone or PC date is incorrect, it will still use it.
4/9/22, 7:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: You have done well. Ensure you don't miss any detail in the material. Anything you miss to understand will contribute to your incompetence tomorrow.

4/14/22, 7:44 AM - Omaka Samuel: Yes. Just ensure you follow the material
4/14/22, 7:45 AM - Omaka Samuel: Complete it so you'll move to jQuery
4/15/22, 7:38 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348137615014 I am expecting your report today
4/15/22, 7:38 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2347036253823 you too

4/15/22, 7:40 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 complete js before Monday. By Tuesday you should have started jQuery. After which you begin full-time front-end projects development.
4/15/22, 7:46 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
4/15/22, 11:34 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Noted Boss

4/15/22, 6:05 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
4/15/22, 6:05 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
4/15/22, 6:06 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Let me fix it
4/15/22, 6:07 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
4/15/22, 6:09 PM - Anthony Tutapis: It's used to specify how the background of a page is formatted, like color, images
4/15/22, 6:09 PM - Omaka Samuel: Cool
4/15/22, 6:09 PM - Omaka Samuel: It will stick to your head when you practice more.
4/15/22, 6:10 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
4/15/22, 6:12 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 henceforth, all your css codes should be separated from the HTML code. They should be in external CSS and linked to the HTML using link href.

This means that I don't want to see even inline CSS in your HTML file.
4/15/22, 6:14 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
4/15/22, 6:16 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 what is the difference between div and span?
4/15/22, 6:16 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Should I use a single external CSS?
4/15/22, 6:17 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes
4/15/22, 6:17 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Both are used for text wrapping
4/15/22, 6:18 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Div is for wrapping a section of a text but span is used to wrap a small portion of a text
4/15/22, 6:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: No
4/15/22, 6:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes. But not the difference
4/15/22, 6:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: Div takes the full with of the container it finds itself.
Span takes the with of the content
4/15/22, 6:20 PM - Omaka Samuel: In CSS we will say the property of div is block while that of span is inline.
4/15/22, 6:20 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
4/15/22, 6:21 PM - Omaka Samuel: I commend your commitment and speed, you are going somewhere.
4/15/22, 6:21 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thanks a lot
4/16/22, 11:01 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
4/18/22, 1:49 PM - Omaka Samuel: Happy Easter to you guys.
4/18/22, 1:49 PM - Omaka Samuel: How did you celebrate your Easter?
4/18/22, 2:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: I've seen your work.
You just started Programming.

If you can master JavaScript absolutely, no programming language will be difficult for you to learn.
4/18/22, 2:48 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: This message was deleted
4/18/22, 3:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I'm willing to master it....  Help me to.
4/18/22, 3:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Best wishes to you sir.
4/18/22, 3:34 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Me and my laptop celebrated with JavaScript..
4/18/22, 4:29 PM - Omaka Samuel: üòÇ
4/18/22, 4:33 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Same to you sir
4/18/22, 4:34 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Please sir, how do I use url() for images
4/18/22, 4:34 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Because the one I got from the module is not displaying
4/18/22, 4:36 PM - Omaka Samuel: If your image is stored on assets/images/bg.jpg

background: url("assets/images/bg.jpg");
4/18/22, 4:37 PM - Omaka Samuel: They taught you how to add extra style property like size, position, etx
4/18/22, 4:37 PM - Omaka Samuel: *etc
4/18/22, 4:37 PM - Omaka Samuel: Let me know if it persists
4/18/22, 4:38 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
4/18/22, 4:39 PM - Anthony Tutapis: It's working
4/18/22, 4:39 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thanks a lot
4/18/22, 4:39 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Yes
4/18/22, 4:41 PM - Omaka Samuel: You're welcome
4/19/22, 7:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I will be done with vanilla js tonight.....

Should i continue with jQuery?
4/19/22, 8:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: Great
4/19/22, 8:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes, for the sake of the knowledge
4/19/22, 8:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: You would still need to do one more js framework like React js or node js
4/19/22, 8:20 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: After JQuery and before projects?
4/19/22, 8:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: This after projects.
4/19/22, 8:23 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay sir
4/19/22, 8:24 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Is like jQuery is no longer in high demand
4/19/22, 8:25 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's not. React, Node etc are the modern frameworks.
4/19/22, 8:25 PM - Omaka Samuel: But I use it more in place of js
4/19/22, 8:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: The Advantages of these ones is because they can be used for front-end and backend too.
4/19/22, 8:27 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Wow.... But have you been using them personally?
4/19/22, 8:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: I haven't
4/19/22, 8:28 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay
4/19/22, 8:28 PM - Omaka Samuel: I use PHP for my backend
4/19/22, 8:29 PM - Omaka Samuel: But most job description require either React or Nodejs
4/19/22, 8:29 PM - Omaka Samuel: So you see why you have pick one of them.
4/19/22, 8:30 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes I do
4/19/22, 8:31 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay
4/21/22, 2:54 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Good day Mr Omaka, please what is the use of target="_blank" and target="_top"
4/21/22, 2:54 PM - Anthony Tutapis: And their difference?
4/21/22, 3:01 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: target="_blank" is used when you want the link to be opened in another tab or blank tab. It ensures that the link does not open on the same tab that your site is opened..... target="_top" this is used to to return to the top of your page..

Voice note below explains better
4/21/22, 3:01 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
4/21/22, 3:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: üëç
4/21/22, 3:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: Use blank when the link is not leading to same site you're working on.
4/21/22, 3:03 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK, I do understand, thanks
4/21/22, 7:29 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Boss, i have started jQuery
4/21/22, 7:30 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I must confess that I love it.. Shorter code length
4/21/22, 7:36 PM - Omaka Samuel: üòÉ
4/21/22, 7:37 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's why it's write less do more.
4/21/22, 8:01 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Honesty
4/21/22, 8:06 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: *Honestly
4/22/22, 11:40 AM - Omaka Samuel: Good morning everyone
4/22/22, 11:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: This is a reminder to wake everyone up and face their task.
4/22/22, 11:42 AM - Omaka Samuel: Even the devil cannot stop your life from improving if you stick to instructions and commitment.
4/22/22, 2:50 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK SIR
4/22/22, 3:27 PM - Anthony Tutapis: <Media omitted>
4/23/22, 4:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 why are you using HTTrack software to copy codes from w3schools website?
4/23/22, 4:32 PM - Omaka Samuel: I am seeing Bootstrap css external link in your project, yet you have not started bootstrap.
4/23/22, 4:33 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I haven't heard of the software be4
4/23/22, 4:33 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2347036253823 , @2349034169810 and @2348133409143 are you still with us?
4/23/22, 4:34 PM - Omaka Samuel: Where did you get the w3schools offline you're using on your PC?
4/23/22, 4:34 PM - Anthony Tutapis: It's part of an example in the module
4/23/22, 4:35 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2348137615014
4/23/22, 4:36 PM - Omaka Samuel: So why am I seeing w3schools pages on your project?
4/23/22, 4:36 PM - Omaka Samuel: The pages contains exactly their codes
4/23/22, 4:36 PM - Anthony Tutapis: https://www.mediafire.com/file/xmasvm3hvo3w81d/W3Schools_Offline_Latest_Version_%5BCloned_by_Md_Maruf_Adnan_Sami%5D.rar/file
4/23/22, 4:38 PM - Omaka Samuel: Okay
4/23/22, 4:38 PM - Omaka Samuel: So why did you copy w3schools pages into your project
4/23/22, 4:38 PM - Omaka Samuel: ?
4/23/22, 4:39 PM - Omaka Samuel: This is not the first time
4/23/22, 4:39 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I thought we are use their module for practice
4/23/22, 4:40 PM - Omaka Samuel: Nobody said so
4/23/22, 4:40 PM - Anthony Tutapis: So every topic they treat, has a try it yourself
4/23/22, 4:40 PM - Omaka Samuel: You were to do what they did
4/23/22, 4:40 PM - Omaka Samuel: You are only expected to copy their media files like images and videos
4/23/22, 4:41 PM - Omaka Samuel: Try it is for those without code editor to try it.
4/23/22, 4:41 PM - Omaka Samuel: You have a code editor and you can preview your work on browser
4/23/22, 4:42 PM - Omaka Samuel: You don't have any business with tryit
4/23/22, 4:42 PM - Omaka Samuel: I didn't want to see those copied html files again in your project
4/23/22, 4:43 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I actually type the codes they have there
4/23/22, 4:43 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Should I write mine using something different from their example?
4/23/22, 4:46 PM - Anthony Tutapis: And if I get this correct, you are talking about external html files, if yes, am I to create my own external html file for the specified example?
4/23/22, 4:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
4/23/22, 5:01 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Is this the content of his work?
4/23/22, 5:11 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Under css links, the example the used have that default as the code
4/23/22, 5:12 PM - Anthony Tutapis: default.html
4/23/22, 5:14 PM - Omaka Samuel: I want to ask, did you code everything in default.html?
4/23/22, 5:15 PM - Anthony Tutapis: No, I copied the default.html file from the W3Schools Offline folder, insert it in my work folder and then linked it to my work during my practice on links
4/23/22, 5:16 PM - Omaka Samuel: Please, don't do that next time.
4/23/22, 5:16 PM - Omaka Samuel: I don't want to see any code you didn't write in your project
4/23/22, 5:16 PM - Omaka Samuel: Except bootstrap
4/23/22, 5:17 PM - Anthony Tutapis: <Media omitted>
4/23/22, 5:17 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK
4/23/22, 5:17 PM - Omaka Samuel: Please don't use try it again
4/23/22, 5:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: You should be coding in your code editor
4/23/22, 5:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: If they link to any html file, that file is not your main focus, except you're doing a full project
4/23/22, 5:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: You are only expected to write the default.html
4/23/22, 5:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: Even if it leave nowhere
4/23/22, 5:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's only when you're doing a complete project that you have to create all the pages.
4/23/22, 5:20 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Understood
4/23/22, 5:20 PM - Omaka Samuel: I don't want to see any code copied into your project for any reason
4/23/22, 5:20 PM - Omaka Samuel: Focus on doing what each topic says.
4/23/22, 5:20 PM - Omaka Samuel: Move from one topic to another

4/28/22, 10:41 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Wow!
4/28/22, 10:44 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: One of my highest motivation from our mentor is:

"Stop whatever that will stop you from becoming a programmer this year"
4/28/22, 10:46 AM - Omaka Samuel: Not even your jobüòå
4/28/22, 10:48 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: I'm trying very hard.... The Lord is my strength
4/28/22, 10:50 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGod help me... The jobs keeps demanding more time. But I will be dropping one this month, so I can concentrate better

4/28/22, 4:46 PM - Omaka Samuel: Check this guys, have been on it since Tuesday thereabout
4/28/22, 4:47 PM - Omaka Samuel: No code used
4/28/22, 4:49 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: WordPress?
4/28/22, 4:50 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes
4/28/22, 4:50 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Wow.... Looks great
4/28/22, 4:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: I supposed to finish it same Tuesday, but the major problem was design concept.
4/28/22, 4:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: It took time to craft design concept for each block of content I was given.
4/28/22, 4:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Same thing you'll be facing in coding front-end
4/28/22, 4:53 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Is like my coding journey is about to start
4/28/22, 4:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: Sure
4/28/22, 4:55 PM - Omaka Samuel: If you're sure you understood JavaScript, you won't have issues in any other programming language you'll be learning.

You'll be seeing similarities. Just difference in syntax.
4/28/22, 4:57 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes I do... But don't know how to put the different topics together
4/28/22, 4:57 PM - Omaka Samuel: Projects
4/28/22, 4:57 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I guess that's where  mastery comes in
4/28/22, 5:00 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay
4/28/22, 5:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
4/28/22, 5:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: It is testing your knowledge in design and js
4/28/22, 5:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: But you're not expected to use this design
4/28/22, 5:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: Do something extremely beautiful
4/28/22, 5:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: With simplicity
4/28/22, 5:05 PM - Omaka Samuel: When a user types and hits their keyboard enter key or clicks the send arrow, it adds the text into the chat.
4/28/22, 5:05 PM - Omaka Samuel: The chat will accumulate, but not saved.
4/28/22, 5:06 PM - Omaka Samuel: That means if browser reloads, the chats are gone.
4/28/22, 5:06 PM - Omaka Samuel: Make research of standard website chatbots and steal design ideas from it
4/28/22, 5:07 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>

4/30/22, 12:12 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 stop using CDN.
The only disadvantage is that you have to on your data to work locally. If so, then why is it local?
Host all your css or js framework in your project.
4/30/22, 12:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: Secondly, at your level, 100% of your css should be external.
The reason is that if you put any css in your html code, you will have to modify all your pages individually when you want to modify a CSS design.
4/30/22, 12:16 AM - Omaka Samuel: But if all css in the site is pointing to one css, you modify one and the changes apply to all pages.
4/30/22, 12:17 AM - Omaka Samuel: Oh. @@2348130855737 sorry, I am actually reviewing @2349034169810 's work.
4/30/22, 12:18 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 you're permitted to use CDN for now until you complete bootstrap

5/2/22, 9:29 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Happy new month people of God
5/2/22, 9:39 AM - Omaka Samuel: Same to you.
5/2/22, 8:17 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Good evening Mr Omaka and happy new month, please I have been doing some thinking with regards to background: and back ground-color property
5/2/22, 8:17 PM - Anthony Tutapis: What is their difference and when to use each?
5/2/22, 9:07 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
5/2/22, 9:12 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thank you for reply
5/2/22, 9:13 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I missed something here, it's actually background: red; and background-color:red;
5/2/22, 9:47 PM - Omaka Samuel: Thank you for your input
5/2/22, 9:49 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
5/2/22, 9:49 PM - Omaka Samuel: So if I only want the background to have colour, I use background-color: red
5/2/22, 9:50 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK
5/2/22, 9:50 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thank you
5/2/22, 9:50 PM - Omaka Samuel: If I want the background to have image, i use background-image: url("paper.gif");
5/2/22, 9:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: If I don't want the image to repeat I use background-repeat: no-repeat.
5/2/22, 9:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Now, background is a shorthand that helps to accommodate all the background properties
5/2/22, 9:53 PM - Omaka Samuel: It has an order
5/2/22, 9:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: Instead of saying 
background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
5/2/22, 9:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: I'll say background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
5/2/22, 9:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: The first value must be color, second image, third repeat, fourth position
5/2/22, 10:02 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
5/2/22, 10:02 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I appreciate
5/3/22, 7:49 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 we were expecting the submission of your project yesterday
5/3/22, 10:38 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes but I am still battling with it....
5/3/22, 10:47 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: na now i know say i don start programming, my brain is being challenged to think since you dropped that project for me... I can do it, I need a little time sir.
5/3/22, 10:48 AM - Omaka Samuel: üòÉ

5/8/22, 2:58 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Still waiting Boss
5/9/22, 3:31 PM - Anthony Tutapis: @2348130855737 good evening
5/9/22, 3:32 PM - Anthony Tutapis: This message was deleted
5/9/22, 3:33 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Please if in the style img has width and height say 33% and auto; respectively
5/9/22, 3:34 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Then the img src has width and height 300 each
5/9/22, 3:34 PM - Anthony Tutapis: How do I put this using external CSS file format?
5/9/22, 3:37 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: to link your external css file to your html file
5/9/22, 3:37 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Let me send screenshot
5/9/22, 3:37 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">
5/9/22, 3:37 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay great
5/9/22, 3:45 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: If you have image with width and height 300px and you want to change the width to 33% and height to auto; do the following
5/9/22, 3:45 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: create a CSS file an name it style.css (you can name it anything you want)
5/9/22, 3:46 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2349034169810 I will call you now
5/9/22, 3:46 PM - Anthony Tutapis: <Media omitted>
5/9/22, 3:47 PM - Anthony Tutapis: <Media omitted>
5/9/22, 3:47 PM - Anthony Tutapis: How can I write the width and height in the style instead of putting them under body?
5/9/22, 3:47 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK
5/9/22, 3:53 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: The inline styling is overriding the external css
5/9/22, 3:53 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: You deleted this message
5/9/22, 3:55 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: if you want the external styling to override the inline styling, add !important to each of the value
5/9/22, 3:55 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: img { width: 33%!important;}
5/9/22, 3:55 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
5/9/22, 3:57 PM - Anthony Tutapis: So writing it exactly like this will make the external CSS styling to be used right?
5/9/22, 3:58 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: yes but instead of having inline styling and external styling for one tag, just remove inline styling
5/9/22, 3:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Always avoid inline styling
5/9/22, 3:59 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
5/10/22, 5:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: Perfect advice. By now you all should have done away with inline CSS and moved all styles to external.
5/10/22, 5:48 AM - Omaka Samuel: *My observations.*
5/10/22, 5:51 AM - Omaka Samuel: 1. I can't see That colours used as theme
5/10/22, 5:52 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
5/10/22, 5:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
5/10/22, 5:55 AM - Omaka Samuel: 4. When you hit the "Enter" key, the chat should send. Not only when you click the send button
5/10/22, 5:58 AM - Omaka Samuel: 5. The image placeholder in the Chatbot icon is 105kb, that's too big. It slows down your webpage. Images should be less than 100kb and still retain their quality. Use tinypng.com to reduce image size and retain quality.

5/10/22, 6:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: 9. I am no impressed with your design. At this point, I expect you to "steal" design ideas from different existing standard chatbots. "Steal" their css designs of each thing. 
The best way to perfection is to replicate. As long as you did not copy code. No one will know where you got the design. All they say is "I love the design".
5/10/22, 6:46 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 what topic are you?
5/10/22, 8:21 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Css Style Images

Please I'm not asking for it to be removed from my assignment but if there's another ui that I can do, something a bit less complex to help me "get into the groove" again
5/11/22, 7:18 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Yes sir

I hope you listen to my plea @2347030537705
5/11/22, 7:22 AM - Omaka Samuel: You have to do it and submit what you have done. So I'll know your challenge and help you.

5/12/22, 1:25 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: I'm still working on the chatbot.... I just wanted to drop this one first.
5/12/22, 2:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: How did you bind the click event?
5/12/22, 2:42 AM - Omaka Samuel: Secondly, you need to learn to ask Google with developer's term.

5/12/22, 8:45 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: how does this work?
5/12/22, 8:45 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: what's developer's term

5/12/22, 11:38 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: the click event isn't working
5/12/22, 11:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: It's not generating any error and same time does nothing

5/13/22, 5:40 AM - Omaka Samuel: That means you designed it for your phone.

It's not responsive
5/13/22, 2:49 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: https://cassidyou.github.io/chatbot/
5/13/22, 2:53 PM - Omaka Samuel: When chat is going on, the rotation of the chat icon is distracting.

It should only rotate when chat is not opened or it's collapsed

5/13/22, 6:53 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 there is a simple project you'll handle.
We want to have a subdomain internship.tutapis.com
It supposed to be a team project, but since you are the only one ready yet, you will do it alone.

Normally, I would prefer it on Wordpress, but let's start off coding it.
5/13/22, 6:58 PM - Omaka Samuel: I would want you to do the conceptualization (generate concepts that will suit the project).
It will be a one-page website.

Basically, the aim is to have a cohort program. 
The site will make visitors know what the remote internship is all about, show our team members, students, statistics of our impact, and so on (you will generate more concepts)
5/13/22, 6:59 PM - Omaka Samuel: üìåüìåüìåüìåüìå
On a second thought, this project is for everybody in this group. It is a group project. 

So, everyone will contribute their idea and plan for the features of the website and those who can code it will volunteer.
5/13/22, 7:00 PM - Omaka Samuel: I want to see the progress of your plans in this group.
5/13/22, 7:01 PM - Omaka Samuel: I want the design and features to be of International standard (no body should know that is was done by beginners)
5/13/22, 7:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: Any content you all as for, I will provide them. I will act as though I don't know what content you want, so you all will decide.
5/13/22, 7:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: Tips: the best way to get ideas is to look for similar *standard* projects and steal ideas from.
5/13/22, 7:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: The team lead of this project is @2348130855737
5/13/22, 7:12 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
5/13/22, 7:13 PM - Omaka Samuel: The site should accept applications for the general public when application is open.
5/13/22, 10:06 PM - Omaka Samuel: Guys, this project should not be done in a haste. We need to settle down to build and launch it.
5/13/22, 10:06 PM - Omaka Samuel: More details soon
5/13/22, 10:17 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Make I rush finish this project
5/13/22, 10:17 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: It's dealing with me but I'm learning

5/15/22, 4:32 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes. But I actually want to know how to get the information I'm looking for... 

You have always advice that I look at standard websites of similar project and steal design ideas....

My problem now, is how to get websites that is similar to what I want to build...
5/15/22, 4:35 PM - Omaka Samuel: I will help you with this.
But next time I give you a project, assume I am a client who is more clueless than you.

We would want to show facts and figures of how many persons reached so far.
5/19/22, 6:00 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes... It doesn't have a title...

Asking after parameters like... Number of current interns

Number of trained or alumni interns 

Stuff like that..
5/19/22, 7:43 AM - Omaka Samuel: Please you guys should think creatively. You can ask for valued rather than parameters.
5/19/22, 8:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: We have to make the programs more tasking and demanding. The application process should state it.
5/19/22, 8:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348137615014 I am expecting your report this Friday
5/19/22, 8:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 you too

5/19/22, 9:00 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Attention please*

5/19/22, 9:06 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
5/19/22, 9:19 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 you must finish Bootstrap by next week Friday. Bear it in mind.
5/19/22, 9:19 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
5/19/22, 10:02 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>

5/19/22, 8:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2348141871140
5/19/22, 8:40 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: He can't make reference
5/19/22, 8:40 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2348141871140
5/19/22, 8:40 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Enough, I wasn't involved in the project at the initial plan.
5/19/22, 8:41 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Since he wasn't in the group while those conversations happened
5/19/22, 8:41 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I will call you
5/19/22, 8:41 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Okay then.
5/19/22, 8:42 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: üôÑüôÑüôÑ
5/19/22, 10:30 PM - Omaka Samuel: Oh. Sorry about that. 
The documentation is to be submitted by the group.
5/19/22, 10:30 PM - Omaka Samuel: I was making reference to your personal learning progress
5/19/22, 10:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: I hope you guys have spent time to do something quality enough
5/20/22, 7:51 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 good morning sir.... I have finished jQuery. This group project was initially my personal  project before you asked us to do it as a team...
5/20/22, 8:15 AM - Omaka Samuel: Great.
5/20/22, 8:48 AM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 9:00 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Woow..... Opportunity meeting me unprepared..üòûüòûüòû
5/20/22, 8:07 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 Here comes the documentation
5/20/22, 8:07 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 8:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: Glad to see this.
Let me review it.
5/20/22, 8:12 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay sir
5/20/22, 8:33 PM - Omaka Samuel: Wow.
You guys impressed meüî•
5/20/22, 8:33 PM - Omaka Samuel: Meanwhile, mention those in your team who never participated.
5/20/22, 8:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Everyone participated. But some were more committed than others.
5/20/22, 8:57 PM - Omaka Samuel: *Corrections and observations*
1. Name of program is *Tutapis Internship*, it will come with a logo. So replace *Tutalearn*.
2. Replace  *a 12 months* to *a 12-month*
3. who want to launch a career in 
*software development* ~website and software development~.
4. Participants are trained and mentored by 
senior *software* engineers and experts at Tutapis technologies, 

5. Refrain this statement (and they get to 
understudy our experts working on real world projects.) Secondly, you should not use our, cos you're not writing as one of the interns.

6. Instead of Apply button opening a modal, let it redirect to the application page. 

7. In *More details* 3(vii),  programs include Web Development and Mobile App Development.

8. *Learning path* should not be used with *program*. Learning path should define what sequence of programming languages an intern will follow for each program.

9. Second phase (i, ii) should be Yes or No

10. Project Timeline should include *Backend Development* after front-end.
5/20/22, 9:01 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Noted sir
5/20/22, 9:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: 11. A whole 3 weeks can't be used for UI/UX.
5/20/22, 9:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: 12. 3 weeks is also too much for front-end. Where the work usually lie is the backend.
5/20/22, 9:08 PM - Omaka Samuel: 13. Project Heading should read *DOCUMENTATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TUTAPIS INTERNSHIP WEB APPLICATION*
5/20/22, 9:10 PM - Anthony Tutapis: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 9:12 PM - Omaka Samuel: I'll give you feedback
5/20/22, 9:17 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 do you know what CDN is?
5/20/22, 9:24 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 you did an excellent job.

I hope you understood what you were waiting?

If you did, you will realize that Bootstrap makes work easier to do. Everything is ready designed, just know the right class and call it, then the magic is applied.
5/20/22, 9:24 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2349034169810 let me know if you have any question.
Your next phase now is projects to test your CSS and Bootstrap knowledge.
5/20/22, 9:25 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2348137615014 and @2347067521473 , I hope today doesn't end before you submit your report
5/20/22, 9:26 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705  how long will it take for the backend development?
5/20/22, 9:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: 3 weeks
5/20/22, 9:27 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay
5/20/22, 9:29 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: No Sir
5/20/22, 9:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 10:16 PM - Omaka Samuel: a 12-month
5/20/22, 10:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 10:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: Download and install our office font on your PC
5/21/22, 2:44 AM - Anthony Tutapis: I will explain in my own language, cnd is content delivery network, it is a server that host majorly all the popular css, jquery and java scripts
5/21/22, 2:46 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Most of the cnd makes sure that once we visit sites that make use of cnd, and requests for a file, it's stored in cache and when next we what to use it, it will be readily available and leads to faster loading
5/21/22, 2:48 AM - Anthony Tutapis: My question is, downloading and hosting a bootstrap and including bootstrap from cnd, which one is advisible?
5/21/22, 2:49 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Also, is it always advising to use bootstrap instead of css for certain design or creating things?
5/21/22, 7:12 AM - Omaka Samuel: Good
5/21/22, 7:12 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I'm sorry for not submitting yesterday, please sir, I would like to ask for some more time as I've not finished with the project, I hope my request is granted
5/21/22, 7:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: After all these long time
5/21/22, 7:13 AM - Omaka Samuel: I would want you to host them in your project.
5/21/22, 7:14 AM - Omaka Samuel: Even browsers still store them in cache
5/21/22, 7:14 AM - Anthony Tutapis: Ok
5/21/22, 7:14 AM - Omaka Samuel: Reason is to ensure that you don't use network to work locally. It doesn't make sense
5/21/22, 7:15 AM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
5/21/22, 7:15 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I'm really sorry
It's my fault
5/21/22, 7:16 AM - Omaka Samuel: Submit on Monday

5/25/22, 7:19 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Good morning @2347030537705. W3SCHOOL treated each topic as separate. But I combine them in my report. <div> is not classified because they are used individually here.
Can I add class to the div so as to ensure I get a particular result for each and have continuity or is there another way out?
5/25/22, 7:23 AM - Omaka Samuel: Use class
5/25/22, 7:24 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2347067521473 you know you are backsliding
5/25/22, 7:28 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: okay Sir

5/25/22, 3:55 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Php is same work with Nodejs abi?
5/25/22, 4:42 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes
5/25/22, 4:46 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Ok ok
5/25/22, 4:47 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: So isn't it just easier to learn node since you already know the syntax of JavaScript
5/25/22, 4:47 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: ?
5/25/22, 5:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's a choice. But you are expected to also learn node js in this program
5/25/22, 7:13 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Sorry to ask but why do you need the both of them?
5/25/22, 7:13 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: And will we learn back end before react or react first?
5/25/22, 7:13 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Just curious

Good evening to you...
5/30/22, 9:47 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Good evening Instructor and Colleagues...Please, what is the difference between Id and Class in terms of application? When do we use id and when do we use class? Or can we just use them interchangeably?
5/30/22, 9:47 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I will use analogy to explain it... read carefully
5/30/22, 9:48 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: In our company, every staff has IDentity number and no two staffs have the same IDentity number.
5/30/22, 9:49 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Still in the same company, all the employees are CLASSified as staff.
5/30/22, 9:50 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Id is used when you want to refer to ONE tag element. No two or more should have the same ID.
5/30/22, 9:50 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: class is used for  a collective or related tag elements
5/30/22, 9:52 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: check this example
5/30/22, 9:52 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <input  type="submit" id="btnSubmit">
5/30/22, 9:53 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Also, the major difference is that I D is unique.
5/30/22, 9:53 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Correct üíØüíØ.
5/30/22, 9:54 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: I love the move, we should always brain storm here.
5/30/22, 9:55 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: That means It is wrong to say
<input type="submit" class=btn submit> and the style . btnsubmit...?
5/30/22, 9:56 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: It is not wrong... it it correct to say that..
5/30/22, 9:56 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Id is unique... let me explain
5/30/22, 9:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: if you have <input type="submit" id="btnSubmit">...... it will be wrong to assign id="btnSubmit" to another tag element.. "btnSbumit" will only be assigned to one tag element..
5/30/22, 10:00 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Id is like phone number, no two persons can have one phone number...
5/30/22, 10:00 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: The only difference between them is that ‚Äúid‚Äù is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while ‚Äúclass‚Äù selector can apply to multiple elements.
5/30/22, 10:00 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: good
5/30/22, 10:01 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2348137615014 I will call you now
5/30/22, 10:01 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Okay. Thanks
5/30/22, 10:09 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Thank you very for the explanation... I get it perfectly now. Thanksüôèüèª
5/30/22, 10:09 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Thanks a lot Bro... I appreciate
5/30/22, 10:10 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: You are welcome Nedu...we are team
5/30/22, 10:15 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: It's feels really good, I must confess
5/31/22, 2:24 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Good day all
5/31/22, 2:24 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Hope you guys are having a good day
5/31/22, 2:25 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Good day to you.
5/31/22, 2:25 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Please hope using external javascripts is better?
5/31/22, 2:25 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Yeah, is quite better.
5/31/22, 2:27 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: It separates HTML and code. It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain. Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.
5/31/22, 2:28 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK brother
5/31/22, 2:28 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thank you a lot
5/31/22, 2:28 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: You are welcome.
5/31/22, 2:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: üëåüèΩ

6/1/22, 9:56 AM - Chinedu Tutapis: Happy new month. I'm wishing everyone a productive June
6/1/22, 3:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Hello guys.
6/1/22, 3:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Good afternoon
6/1/22, 3:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Is the 2 weeks for UI/UX not over yet?
6/1/22, 3:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Our project manager
6/1/22, 3:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737
6/1/22, 3:53 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: This week, she's on it

6/7/22, 9:24 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 @2349034169810 @2348141871140 you guys should attend to this
6/7/22, 10:04 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Padding is the space
between a container and the content.

 Margin is the space between the container and outside  while border is the line drawn around the padding and the content
6/7/22, 10:07 PM - Anthony Tutapis: While using padding, width, height, border, it's advisible to use box-sizing: border-box;
6/7/22, 10:08 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Because box-sizing property allows u to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height
6/7/22, 10:12 PM - Anthony Tutapis: So to achieve ur aim at diagram 2,  use max-width:auto;
Padding:25px;
Margin:0px;
Border-style:solid;
Border-width:5px;
Box-sizing:border-box;
6/7/22, 10:14 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
6/7/22, 10:14 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Use margin-left:800px; it will move to the left hand side close to the end of the left hand of the page
6/7/22, 10:16 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: use <br> each input tag to move the next content to the next line
6/7/22, 10:19 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I think using <br><br> after each input tag will help him achieve exactly what he draw
6/7/22, 10:21 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: First Name: <input type="text" name="first_name" placeholder="First name">
   <br>
   Last Name: <input type="text" name="last_name" placeholder="Last name">
   <br>
   Email: <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email">
   <br>
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
6/7/22, 10:22 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: After this üëÜüëÜüëÜ, you can add margin or padding to the elements
6/7/22, 10:22 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2348137615014  I will call you now
6/7/22, 10:23 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Thanks so much.
6/7/22, 10:23 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Yeah... Thanks a lot
6/7/22, 10:23 PM - Chinedu Tutapis: Sure please
6/7/22, 10:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: Good one guys.
6/7/22, 10:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: It seems you guys are not asking enough questions.
This group was created for collaboration.
6/8/22, 11:23 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705  This is how far with the UI/UX https://www.figma.com/file/OD6xHex18nzJLK3ppFxJTi/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

6/10/22, 3:46 PM - Anthony Tutapis: This message was deleted
6/10/22, 3:52 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Like in var text = "" ;
Var i = 0;
While (i <10) {
         text += "<br>The number is "+ i; i++;
}
document.getElementById("loop").innerHTML = text;
6/10/22, 3:53 PM - Anthony Tutapis: This message was deleted
6/10/22, 3:54 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Why is the var text value declared as "" ;
6/10/22, 3:54 PM - Anthony Tutapis: ?
6/10/22, 4:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: Assigning a variable to "" means the value is empty
6/10/22, 4:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: var text = "some text"
var kb = "" //This is empty
6/10/22, 4:03 PM - Omaka Samuel: It is just like surrounding a quotation around nothing
6/10/22, 4:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: But, the rule is that whenever you declare a variable, you must assignment it to something before use.
Since you have not started using it, you can assign it to empty string
6/10/22, 4:08 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK sir
6/10/22, 4:08 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thank you

7/5/22, 3:45 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Ok sir
7/5/22, 3:51 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: $user = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

             session_start();
            
            $_SESSION['userid'] = $user[0]['users_id'];
            $_SESSION['useruid'] = $user[0]['users_uid'];
7/5/22, 3:52 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: if user email and password is in correct.......... this should run to create a session
7/5/22, 3:53 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: on my user_profile page, I have the following
7/5/22, 3:53 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <?php if(isset($_SESSION['useruid'])){?>

      <a class="nav-link" href="#"><?php echo $_SESSION['useruid'] ?></a>
      <a class="nav-link" href="includes/logout.inc.php">Logout</a>

      <?php 
      }else{

      
    ?>
     <a class="nav-link" href="#">Sign Up</a>
      <a class="nav-link" href="#">Login</a>

      <?php
      }
      ?>
7/5/22, 3:54 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: But when I log in, no session is created
7/5/22, 3:54 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 How do i fix this
7/5/22, 3:58 PM - Omaka Samuel: Did you start session on this page?
7/5/22, 3:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: yes sir
7/5/22, 3:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: session_start();
7/5/22, 4:00 PM - Omaka Samuel: Push your project to GitHub. Share link let me study your code.
7/5/22, 4:00 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay
7/5/22, 4:02 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>

7/5/22, 4:12 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Link to the project https://github.com/cassidyou/signupsystem
7/5/22, 6:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: Echo session before checking if it exists
7/5/22, 6:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: Just to be sure session was set
7/5/22, 6:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: You didn't dump your database in the repo
7/6/22, 6:10 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Will do that
7/6/22, 9:27 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Good morning sir, I have just dump the database in the repo.... You can check it out now
7/6/22, 9:28 AM - Omaka Samuel: Did you do this?
7/6/22, 9:28 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: I echo session_id() on the index page and it returned an id
7/6/22, 9:52 AM - Omaka Samuel: echo $_SESSION['useruid']
7/6/22, 9:54 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: displays nothing, not even an error
7/6/22, 10:19 AM - Omaka Samuel: Don't put it in any if statement
7/6/22, 10:19 AM - Omaka Samuel: Place it below session start
7/6/22, 10:20 AM - Omaka Samuel: It should either error or echo the session id
7/6/22, 10:20 AM - Omaka Samuel: Then say if isset session, echo "Hi"
7/6/22, 10:21 AM - Omaka Samuel: If Hi echos, then session is active
7/6/22, 10:21 AM - Omaka Samuel: If session is active and session id couldn't echo, it means you set an Empty id
7/6/22, 10:22 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay
7/6/22, 10:22 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: I just print_r($user).. and I discovered that the array only contains password
7/6/22, 10:23 AM - Omaka Samuel: What is $user here?
7/6/22, 10:24 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: $user is the array that is fetched from the database if the user exists
7/6/22, 10:25 AM - Omaka Samuel: Remove that [0] in your fetch result
7/6/22, 10:25 AM - Omaka Samuel: Add Limit 1 at the end of your query
7/6/22, 10:26 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay
7/6/22, 10:26 AM - Omaka Samuel: Ensure you said SELECT *
7/6/22, 10:26 AM - Omaka Samuel: Then test if ['id'] was returned in the array
7/6/22, 10:27 AM - Omaka Samuel: If yes then you should be able to store it in session
7/6/22, 10:27 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: okaya
7/6/22, 10:27 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: *okay
7/6/22, 10:31 AM - Omaka Samuel: Please avoid using .inc.php
7/6/22, 10:31 AM - Omaka Samuel: Say logout.php instead of logout.inc.php
7/6/22, 10:32 AM - Omaka Samuel: The reason is to reduce complexity.
7/6/22, 10:34 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Noted
7/6/22, 12:16 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: This solves the problem
7/6/22, 12:17 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: If i remove [0], it will not display anything....... The query is expected to fetch only one record
7/6/22, 12:17 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: error handlers are put in place to ensure that no username or email is duplicated in the database
7/6/22, 12:19 PM - Omaka Samuel: So is the problem totally solved?
7/6/22, 12:22 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: yes.. the problem was that I in my statement I used SELECT user_pwd, so it was only fetching the password from the database
7/6/22, 12:23 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes sir, thank you sir.
7/6/22, 12:53 PM - Omaka Samuel: Cool.
I hope you're learning
7/6/22, 1:00 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes sir

7/6/22, 4:01 PM - Omaka Samuel: Check if it pointed to it correctly
7/6/22, 6:22 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes it is..  If I copy the file path and run it on the browser, it displays the css properties. But if I load the document through the server, css doesn't display... It is an HTML doc.... Will later change it to php

7/9/22, 12:12 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 Talking about security, if prepare() statement is used, is there any need for htmlspecialchars?
7/9/22, 12:12 PM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 I am extending your project.
Add a watermark with Tutapis Logo to all featured image of the blog.
This should be optional. You should allow the writer determine if they'll watermark or not.
Watermark should be at bottom right.
Ensure you add Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp share buttons at the bottom of the each post.
7/9/22, 12:13 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes. Because prepare doesn't have effect on special characters
7/9/22, 12:13 PM - Omaka Samuel: You are submitting on the 15th of July, 2022
7/9/22, 12:13 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay. So if htmlspecialchars is used, any need for prepare statements?
7/9/22, 12:14 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes
7/9/22, 12:14 PM - Omaka Samuel: htmlspecialchars are not SQL injection
7/9/22, 12:16 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay, are you saying that htmlspecialchars stands against Javascript injection while prepare statement stand against SQL injection.. If that is the case, that means both should be used..
7/9/22, 12:17 PM - Omaka Samuel: Exactly
7/9/22, 12:18 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay...woow

7/11/22, 2:17 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK, thanks
7/11/22, 4:02 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Hello team, I need help,
When I put in background-image via external CSS it won't show.
The Code is
 body {
Background-image: url("assets/images/bg.png");
} 

But when same code is used in internal css, it will show.


N/B: the external CSS is linked correctly and its showing background color when I used it to test it.
7/11/22, 4:02 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Thanks
7/11/22, 4:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: The url should point in reference to the location of the external CSS and not reference to the HTML.
7/11/22, 4:08 PM - Anthony Tutapis: I'm sorry, I dont understand
7/11/22, 4:55 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Try this.....


 body {
Background-image: url("../assets/images/bg.png");
}
7/11/22, 4:56 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: If it doesn't work use ./assets/images/bg.png
7/11/22, 4:58 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Still not working
7/11/22, 4:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay... I have had similar issue, let me get home. I will reply you.
7/11/22, 5:14 PM - Omaka Samuel: Just explain why the answer so that he'll get it
7/11/22, 5:20 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Tony are you there!
7/11/22, 5:23 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: background: url('../images/bg.jpg');
7/11/22, 5:24 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: when you use ../, it means that you want to go to the root folder
7/11/22, 5:25 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: when you type background: url('../'), *hold down your ctrl key and press the space bar*, it will suggest the available folders for you to navigate till you get the file you want. That's if you are using VS Code.
7/11/22, 5:41 PM - Omaka Samuel: Don't use the VS Code shortcut to teach beginner o
7/11/22, 5:42 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's better he understands how to point a file from any folder.
7/11/22, 5:42 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Haha.    Okay sir.
7/11/22, 5:43 PM - Omaka Samuel: assets/images/bg.png means the file (html) where you are calling from is in same folder with assets.
7/11/22, 5:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: But if you're calling from assest/css/style.css, it means that you have to take one step our of the css folder before you locate the images folder
7/11/22, 5:45 PM - Omaka Samuel: So in the case file you'll have ../assest/images/bg.png
7/11/22, 5:48 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Tried this still won't show
7/11/22, 5:49 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Tony, share a screenshoot of your project folder from your code editor
7/11/22, 5:50 PM - Anthony Tutapis: OK
7/11/22, 5:53 PM - Omaka Samuel: Try this ../images/bg.png
7/11/22, 5:54 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: This is what I used in my project and it works perfectly.

7/11/22, 8:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: *Attention*
On no account should any image size in your project be more than 100kb.
21kb-55kb is perfect as well.
Always use tinypng.com to compress images without losing the quality.

7/14/22, 1:30 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
7/14/22, 1:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: Using capital on Tutapis Technologies makes the design occupy unnecessary space. You would have used capital Initial
7/14/22, 1:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: Then the font is too common and has no element of design.
7/14/22, 1:33 PM - Omaka Samuel: This is our new font pack.
Go and research how to use the font in CSS.

7/16/22, 11:44 AM - Omaka Samuel: I can't preview it. Since it's PHP
7/16/22, 12:43 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
7/16/22, 12:43 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I have read the doc but it's not working
7/16/22, 12:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: See video on YouTube
7/16/22, 12:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: You're doing great
7/16/22, 1:02 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I got it
7/16/22, 1:02 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: thanks Boss
7/16/22, 1:40 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
7/16/22, 1:40 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 Please review
7/16/22, 1:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's good
7/16/22, 3:54 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Is this enough to cater for all the features of the project?
7/16/22, 4:25 PM - Omaka Samuel: You know what you're doing. So you should know if it's enough.
7/17/22, 7:06 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Hi Minds, Happy sunday to y'all.........
7/17/22, 7:07 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 dos .htaccess work on localhost?
7/17/22, 7:07 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: *does
7/17/22, 7:19 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Same to you brother
7/17/22, 7:24 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes
7/17/22, 7:25 PM - Omaka Samuel: Happy Sunday to you too
7/17/22, 7:26 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I need some help
7/17/22, 7:27 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I want to take the slug from the database and include it in the url
7/17/22, 7:28 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: something like this.... localhost/blog/how-to-drink-water
7/17/22, 7:29 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 7:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: While submitting, pass the post title to a function that will convert the title to a slug (you can Google a function to do that). Then check if the slug generated already exists in any other post, if it exists, add *-1* to it, to make it unique. 
Then save along with post.
7/17/22, 7:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I already have the function to generate slug
7/17/22, 7:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: the slug is already inserted into the database
7/17/22, 7:34 PM - Omaka Samuel: Pass it to url using GET method
7/17/22, 7:34 PM - Omaka Samuel: If you're using slug, don't use id alongside
7/17/22, 7:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay
7/17/22, 7:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: done
7/17/22, 7:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: but there's still *single-post.php?slug=* in the url
7/17/22, 7:40 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: *http://localhost/tutaBlog/single-post.php?slug=5-habits-that-can-improve-your-life* is the url currently
7/17/22, 7:41 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: how can I make it cleaner like this *http://localhost/tutaBlog/5-habits-that-can-improve-your-life*
7/17/22, 7:46 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's Model View Control(MVC).
Laravel (a PHP framework)solves that problem, so no need to build MVC.
7/17/22, 7:46 PM - Omaka Samuel: Just use parameters to accept it for now
7/17/22, 7:47 PM - Omaka Samuel: When you get to Leravel you'll have it
7/17/22, 7:47 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay.. thanks Boss
7/17/22, 11:06 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 9:24 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Good evening Great Devs... I trust y'all are doing well.
7/18/22, 9:25 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705  this backend stuff is quite different from frontend ooo
7/18/22, 9:27 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I created and hard-coded one page for all the categories...... food-page.php, education-page.php etc
7/18/22, 9:28 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: But now, I ended up using only one page to display all the categories....
7/18/22, 9:30 PM - Omaka Samuel: üòÇ
7/18/22, 9:30 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's why frontend is just template
7/18/22, 9:31 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Really funny.... just laughing at myself... all the time wasted
7/18/22, 9:31 PM - Omaka Samuel: I said something some months ago that front-end developers need to have a bit insight on how backend works.
7/18/22, 9:32 PM - Omaka Samuel: To enable them know certain things
7/18/22, 9:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I just remembered Blossom Height Unique Hotels fronted that I did....  I created layer for all the hotel room categories
7/18/22, 9:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Honestly
7/18/22, 9:33 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes
7/18/22, 9:34 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: When you were talking about template, I didn't understand what you meant until, that I have to start deleting all the pages that I created.
7/18/22, 9:38 PM - Omaka Samuel: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 9:43 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Really funny.... But there's no project that I have done that the one I'm doing right now.... Since you gave me this project, I have been coding in the dream every night... I'm continually thinking on how to solve the problem..
7/18/22, 9:44 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: I like it.... The brain is actively engaged....
7/18/22, 9:46 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's the spirit.
7/18/22, 9:47 PM - Omaka Samuel: There are more complex projects on the way.
It builds your professional confidence
7/19/22, 12:44 PM - Anthony Tutapis: How can I use a text editor to learn php from W3Schools
7/19/22, 12:44 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Been battling with it since yesterday
7/19/22, 12:44 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Good day team
7/19/22, 12:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: How?
7/19/22, 12:48 PM - Omaka Samuel: Are you for frontend or backend?
7/19/22, 12:49 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Frontend
7/19/22, 12:49 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Want to know a little of php and sql
7/19/22, 12:50 PM - Anthony Tutapis: But can't get around how to create the file
7/19/22, 12:50 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Like css and html
7/19/22, 12:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: What is going to be your area of specialization
7/19/22, 12:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: Frontend or backend?
7/19/22, 12:51 PM - Omaka Samuel: I don't think you've done enough frontend projects
7/19/22, 1:01 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Frontend
7/19/22, 1:01 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Then let me concentrate on projects
7/19/22, 1:01 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Give me another project please
7/19/22, 1:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: So it means you're not going to learn PHP and anything frontend.
7/19/22, 1:02 PM - Anthony Tutapis: Yes
7/19/22, 1:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: You'll focus on JavaScript libraries such as React
7/19/22, 1:02 PM - Omaka Samuel: üëç

7/22/22, 5:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: üëç
7/22/22, 5:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: I guess the problem is from your database schema
7/22/22, 5:54 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: what do I do?
7/22/22, 5:55 PM - Omaka Samuel: Have you dropped the error on Google?
7/22/22, 5:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: You much get insight if people have run into same problem in the past
7/22/22, 5:57 PM - Omaka Samuel: From the error, *Integrity constraint violation* is the keyword.
So drop the entire error message on Google and look out for results that has this keyword
7/22/22, 5:58 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes... but the solution isn't working.......
7/22/22, 5:58 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Though I used *how to delete parent row*

7/23/22, 10:33 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705 I was able to resolve the constraints issue.......
7/23/22, 10:35 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: In the process of trying to solve the problem, I created another problem *deleted all the information in the database* So I had to start from the beginning.
7/23/22, 10:35 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Thanks Boos
7/23/22, 10:36 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: *Boss*
7/23/22, 10:38 AM - Omaka Samuel: ü§£
7/23/22, 10:38 AM - Omaka Samuel: Ensure you don't at anytime ommit the "WHERE" clause
7/23/22, 10:39 AM - Omaka Samuel: It can ruin your database and probably lead you to jail
7/23/22, 10:40 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay.... this is what I did.... I dropped a table that connects the posts table to the category table
7/23/22, 10:41 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Mehn! I felt really bad and confused, but at the same time, I knew it was an opportunity to learn the constraints stuff.
7/23/22, 10:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: Okay
7/23/22, 10:41 AM - Omaka Samuel: Also be careful especially when using "DELETE" and "UPDATE" keywords
7/23/22, 10:42 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay
7/23/22, 10:43 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Thanks Boss
7/23/22, 10:43 AM - Omaka Samuel: ‚úåüèΩ
7/23/22, 5:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Good evening Devs.
7/23/22, 5:39 PM - Omaka Samuel: Good evening
7/23/22, 5:39 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705  If a password is hashed, can it be converted back to plain text?
7/23/22, 5:40 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes.
But it depends on the hash used. 
Hash such as md5 can easily be decrypted.
7/23/22, 5:41 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: can this *$hashedPwd = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT)* be decrypted?
7/23/22, 5:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: It can't
7/23/22, 5:45 PM - Omaka Samuel: But password_verify() can be used to verify if the password is a given string
7/23/22, 5:45 PM - Omaka Samuel: First argument is the suspected password, second argument is the hashed string
7/23/22, 5:46 PM - Omaka Samuel: It will return true if it it is the same.
7/23/22, 5:46 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's going to be difficult
7/23/22, 5:48 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: what's going to be difficult?
7/23/22, 5:49 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's going to be difficult to try if difficult words match the hashed password
7/23/22, 5:49 PM - Omaka Samuel: You can use it.
7/23/22, 5:50 PM - Omaka Samuel: I use md5(sha1($password)).
7/23/22, 5:50 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's not popular
7/23/22, 5:51 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: It is a php function?
7/23/22, 5:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes.
7/23/22, 5:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: md5() is used for hashing
7/23/22, 5:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: sha1() is also used
7/23/22, 5:56 PM - Omaka Samuel: So I combined both of them at same time.
7/23/22, 5:58 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: double hashing
7/23/22, 5:58 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: can i send email from my localhost?
7/23/22, 5:59 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: If a user is registered by the admin, I want the password and username of the user to be sent to his email
7/23/22, 5:59 PM - Omaka Samuel: Yes, but with SMTP
7/23/22, 6:02 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay, I will check it out..
7/23/22, 6:04 PM - Omaka Samuel: Okay
7/25/22, 12:14 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Hi great Devs,

7/25/22, 12:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: The idea is to get them from the email to visit the site
7/25/22, 12:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's traffic
7/25/22, 12:45 PM - Omaka Samuel: So you don't show all the content of the email there
7/25/22, 12:45 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's why we have Excerpt

7/25/22, 5:09 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: How do I fix the broken image
7/25/22, 5:10 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: $mail->AddEmbeddedImage($image, 'Image');
7/25/22, 5:10 PM - Omaka Samuel: You didn't point the image correctly
7/25/22, 5:10 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <img alt='Featured image' src='cid:Image'>
7/25/22, 5:10 PM - Omaka Samuel: Trace the path
7/25/22, 5:11 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: $image is the path
7/25/22, 5:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: Are you sure that image src pointed correctly?
7/25/22, 5:12 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: The image is fetched from the database
7/25/22, 5:23 PM - Omaka Samuel: Did you save image in the database or you saved the reference to the image?
7/25/22, 6:03 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Reference to the image
7/25/22, 6:04 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Every image has a unique folder to avoid overriding
7/25/22, 6:05 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Upload/unique_folder/image.jpeg
7/25/22, 6:25 PM - Omaka Samuel: Ah
7/25/22, 6:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: That's complexity. You're creating a problem
7/25/22, 6:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: Just make every image name unique
7/25/22, 6:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: Use a unique column of the post to identify the image.
7/25/22, 6:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: Then save everything in one folder.
7/25/22, 6:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: In that case no two images can every bear see name.
7/25/22, 6:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: Then save only the image name.
7/25/22, 6:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: At db
7/25/22, 6:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: Don't save the entire path to save db memory
7/25/22, 6:29 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay....

7/29/22, 4:15 PM - Omaka Samuel: Can u see the codes that binds the share button?
7/29/22, 4:20 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes
7/29/22, 4:47 PM - Omaka Samuel: Can I see the code?
7/29/22, 5:05 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
7/29/22, 5:07 PM - Omaka Samuel: Remove src=sdkpreparse
7/29/22, 5:07 PM - Omaka Samuel: Then try again
7/29/22, 5:07 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay
7/29/22, 5:09 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Same thing
7/29/22, 5:18 PM - Omaka Samuel: It seems the sharing url has deprecated
7/29/22, 5:19 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Does it work in localhost?
7/29/22, 5:20 PM - Omaka Samuel: Did you add any Facebook cdn?
7/29/22, 5:22 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
7/29/22, 5:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: Look for the accurate documentation from Facebook
7/29/22, 5:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: It might require you creating a Facebook app
7/29/22, 5:36 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: How
7/29/22, 5:43 PM - Omaka Samuel: The method of sharing post will count the number of shares
7/29/22, 5:43 PM - Omaka Samuel: It's different from just sharing the post.
7/29/22, 5:43 PM - Omaka Samuel: So you'll have to look for the document from Facebook developers platform
7/29/22, 5:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: Since it requires Facebook giving you the data of posts shares, they would possibly want you to create a Facebook app and API
7/29/22, 5:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: I don't know though
7/29/22, 5:44 PM - Omaka Samuel: So find out the official way of using that code you copied
7/29/22, 11:24 PM - Chinonso Tutapis: Good evening sir

7/30/22, 6:18 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: I'll look into it too
7/30/22, 6:37 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Please sir
How do I do this? I don't know how to do this in bootstrap
7/30/22, 7:35 AM - Omaka Samuel: Use bootstrap tabs
7/30/22, 7:35 AM - Omaka Samuel: Then customize the tab to look like this one
7/30/22, 7:36 AM - Chinonso Tutapis: Ok
I'll look into that

8/3/22, 8:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: You have to submit it as raw as it came from the user input
8/3/22, 8:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: Don't pass it through htmlspecialchars
8/3/22, 8:54 AM - Omaka Samuel: Post raw text only to social media
8/3/22, 8:56 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: The post is pulled from database and that means that it has been passed through htmlspecialchars.. This is how it works
8/3/22, 8:57 AM - Omaka Samuel: Since you know the problem now, search for now to convert htmlspecialchars to text in PHP
8/3/22, 8:57 AM - Omaka Samuel: You need to decode it
8/3/22, 8:57 AM - Omaka Samuel: The string from db
8/3/22, 8:57 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay great
8/3/22, 9:42 AM - Omaka Samuel: Your auto poster should basically post the link to the post. Then attach some Excerpt with title.

Ensure you work on your image ogg in each post meta (though this will only work on live server)
8/3/22, 10:59 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
8/3/22, 10:59 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Title in uppercase
8/3/22, 11:01 AM - Omaka Samuel: Link as well, the aim is to generate traffic
8/3/22, 11:03 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: The link is invalid because http is not supported
8/3/22, 11:04 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: I will copy tutapis blog link to test for https links
8/3/22, 11:04 AM - Omaka Samuel: Alright
8/3/22, 11:08 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: <Media omitted>
8/3/22, 11:08 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: i used https://tutapis.com/blog
8/3/22, 11:31 AM - Omaka Samuel: That means it's working fine.
8/3/22, 11:31 AM - Omaka Samuel: I hope the text is excerpt and not the full post.
8/3/22, 11:32 AM - Omaka Samuel: Let me know when you're ready to deploy to server.
8/3/22, 11:32 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes.. The excerpt is 400 words
8/3/22, 11:33 AM - Omaka Samuel: Is 400 words not too much?
8/3/22, 11:33 AM - Omaka Samuel: Just asking
8/3/22, 11:33 AM - Omaka Samuel: Is this one here 400?
8/3/22, 11:33 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes

8/4/22, 3:54 PM - Omaka Samuel: Pass it through the PHP New Line to break nl2br() function
8/4/22, 3:55 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: before inserting or while fetching?
8/4/22, 3:55 PM - Omaka Samuel: While fetching
8/4/22, 3:55 PM - Omaka Samuel: Sorry, while displaying
8/4/22, 7:21 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705  what API displays the countries of visitors on a map.... I'm talking statistics of visitors
8/4/22, 7:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: I don't know any specifically.
8/4/22, 7:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: It will be a good idea to implement it
8/4/22, 7:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: Google it
8/4/22, 7:22 PM - Omaka Samuel: You need to get their IP first
8/4/22, 7:23 PM - Omaka Samuel: Then pass the IP to an API and get response
8/4/22, 7:23 PM - Omaka Samuel: So you should now know what to ask Google
8/4/22, 7:26 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: how to get country by IP
8/4/22, 7:26 PM - Omaka Samuel: There are different ways
8/4/22, 7:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: Some are more accurate than others
8/4/22, 7:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: There's a function I use to get IP
8/4/22, 7:27 PM - Omaka Samuel: Let me get it for you
8/4/22, 7:27 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: okay great
8/4/22, 7:33 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: how do I test it, since I can't go to different country?
8/4/22, 7:37 PM - Omaka Samuel: üòÉDon't you know VPN?

8/15/22, 9:38 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Looking forward to it...
8/15/22, 9:43 AM - Omaka Samuel: Alright
8/15/22, 9:56 AM - Omaka Samuel: @2348130855737 you will understudy a similar product and implement it. You must not implement everything, but the basic things.
1. It should accommodate multiple user accounts.
2. Each user should authenticate with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and Telegram (a user can decide which one to connect). The Authentication data should be saved to database so that they can only authentic once.
3. User should be able to disconnect authentication data of any social media account any time.
4. User should be able to post using one form while it distribute to all the connected social media only.
5. Different social media posting rules and format should be considered while posting.
6. Posting should accommodate Text (text and links), images and videos.
7. User should be able to publish instantly, it schedule when (date & time) it will automatically post on its own.
8/15/22, 10:00 AM - Omaka Samuel: The following are similar solutions:
hootsuite.com
dlvrit.com
socialpilot.co
contentstudio.io
buzzsumo.com
8/15/22, 10:01 AM - Omaka Samuel: The dashboard will be used for our future Tutapis CRM, so you will use a very neat, beautiful and professional dashboard template.
8/15/22, 10:02 AM - Omaka Samuel: The dashboard should have a beautiful login UI, no registration form (a supper admin should be added to the db manually).
8/15/22, 10:04 AM - Omaka Samuel: In other words, the social media manager will be a feature in the CRM (just a menu in the CRM should lead to the Social Media Tool)
8/15/22, 10:06 AM - Omaka Samuel: We will not have to do a UI/UX (except anyone is available to volunteer, we don't have fund for that), or you download a dashboard template.
If you're using a downloaded dashboard, send me the link for review before use.
8/15/22, 10:18 AM - Omaka Samuel: 8. Admin can add a user. The user should not be able to add any user.
9. For each post broadcasted, a copy should be saved to database with reference to the admin that posted it.
8/15/22, 10:28 AM - Omaka Samuel: You are aware that if you submit the same posts multiple times within the same time range, most social media platforms will restrict your account.
Therefore, create a protocol that saves the user from offending such policies.
8/15/22, 11:11 AM - Omaka Samuel: 10. Ensure social media authentication data are encrypted into db and decrypted when you have need of it.
8/15/22, 11:45 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Hello everyone*
I need someone to take up a challenge to create a Telegram Bot.
The bot should welcome new persons to a Telegram group, give them options to select from.
8/15/22, 1:03 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Great.... Thanks..
8/16/22, 8:43 AM - Omaka Samuel: Good morning everyone
8/16/22, 8:44 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Good morning sir
8/16/22, 8:46 AM - Omaka Samuel: Please if you're interested in the Facebook/Instagram Ad course kindly DM
8/16/22, 6:16 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Good evening everyone
8/16/22, 6:16 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Please, what is data entry?
8/16/22, 6:24 PM - Omaka Samuel: Data Entry is the job of entering data into the computer.
Let's say you had a program and over 50,000 persons wrote their phone numbers and emails in a book. And you would want to enter those data into the computer for the purpose of reaching out to them via SMS or email. The act of entering the data is called Data Entry.
8/16/22, 6:24 PM - Omaka Samuel: It is a digital skill
8/16/22, 6:38 PM - Marvellous Tutapis: Alright, thank you very much sir.
8/16/22, 6:42 PM - Omaka Samuel: You're welcome
8/16/22, 10:51 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Hi Devs

8/17/22, 1:57 AM - Marvellous Tutapis: Please, I need more enlightenment on the concept  of Internet of things and big data.
8/18/22, 10:38 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: @2347030537705  Good morning sir,
8/18/22, 10:39 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Please I need help.. I find it difficult to understand the api docs.. can you help me out..
8/18/22, 10:39 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Or maybe I don't know how to implement it..
8/18/22, 10:43 AM - Omaka Samuel: Let's book a session today
8/18/22, 10:43 AM - Omaka Samuel: 1pm
8/18/22, 10:43 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Great.... Thanks
8/18/22, 5:52 PM - Omaka Samuel: Tips:
APIs are built to interact with your application in different language implementation options.
Popular languages include JavaScript, PHP, Java and Python.

If you're using PHP, you should use *PHP curl* to asynchronously interact with APIs.
8/19/22, 7:34 AM - Omaka Samuel: *Good morning Everyone*
Trust you're all good.
I just woke up this morning feeling that most of you here are not inputting more effort as expected. Most of you are not seeing what this path holds in the nearest future. Reason why you are not making good efforts to increase your learning speed.

It is my desire to ensure that you improve weekly. But you cannot just be stagnant here.

If you have strong reasons why you are not making progress, bring it on and I will tell you how I learnt front-end without owing a laptop and got my first laptop in 3rd year as a computer science student.

How I learnt HTML and CSS with a non-smartphone.

How I coded PHP and Android with phone. 

How I lived in a house for 6 months without electricity, but go to the next street for 11 hours night coding after a stressful day.

How I combined programming and academics which was scary.

How in 2018, I rented a room on Abakaliki (Ezza road) and never had light. To meet up, I trek to Pastoral Center (Mile 50) to use electricity.

Today, I sometimes work from 5am to 11pm just to push to the next phase of my life which will be a much easier life.

If you think you got to this group by mistake, kindly exit. Life is full of choices and this group is a choice.

But if you're here to learn, I cannot allow you to remain the same every week. *Never!*
8/19/22, 8:28 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Good morning sir.... Thanks so much for this....ü´°ü´°ü´°ü´°
8/19/22, 8:29 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: When do we do this for today?

8/19/22, 4:11 PM - Omaka Samuel: Someone used localhost
8/19/22, 4:12 PM - Omaka Samuel: Then you change later on production
8/19/22, 4:20 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: This was before https uri's were made default...
8/19/22, 4:21 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Is it possible to configure localhost for https?

8/19/22, 4:36 PM - Oluchi Cassidy: Okay... Thanks
8/22/22, 7:09 AM - Omaka Samuel: Good morning Devs.
Trust you're doing great this morning.

I cheer you up this new week to take up challenge to prioritize your learning. 

There are lots of jobs before us. Lots of projects to tackle together. Lots of money to make together.

8/23/22, 8:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: This should be possible.
You're not actually linking, you're access Facebook Pages, profiles, groups etc, using the API.
8/23/22, 8:36 AM - Omaka Samuel: So you can ask user to select where you can access to publish on their behalf.
8/23/22, 8:37 AM - Omaka Samuel: Then you save a reference to their choice on your db

8/23/22, 8:45 AM - Omaka Samuel: So you know you're saving their ID and not name, cos user might change name tomorrow.
8/23/22, 8:45 AM - Omaka Samuel: Is it the group where the user is admin? Not just group where the user exist.
8/23/22, 8:48 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: Yes
8/23/22, 8:49 AM - Oluchi Cassidy: This turns out to be the groups the user belongs to that he is not admin

8/23/22, 2:15 PM - Omaka Samuel: Make research please
