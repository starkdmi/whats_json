2/19/18, 10:58 PM - Arnab Nandy: This is what PM Modi spoke in his Lok Sabha speech today. He for the first time disclosed that the total amount of NPA in the banks and said they were not 36% as claimed by the Congress but a whopping 82% of bank loans were NPA, which means that 52 lakh crores bank money was given to industrialists by the Congress government without guarantee.

PM Modi said the economy was in a disaster when he took over and if he had disclosed the real state of Banks and economy, every investor in India would have left the country which would have caused a catastrophic effect on the country.

PM Modi said…“Earlier calls used to be made for facilitating loans to their people (close to those in power). Crores of money was given (through loans)…. Had I kept the facts before the nation earlier, it would have hurt the economy.” “ I have remained silent for the sake of Nation, despite knowing what Congress has done, but time has come to reveal truth as banks were getting back into good health and people should know what Congress did in 10 years.”

After the NDA took over, not a single loan was passed which could turn into an NPA, added Modi.

So, one may now realise what is the extent of damage Congress did to our country and economy. This just one scandal lead to a loss of Rs 52 lakh Crore to the Nation.

Yes….520,00,00,00,00,000 crore was the total amount given to these industrialists, now compare this with 2G, CWG Coal and NH scams!

To all Non Bhakts. After hearing the PM speech in parliament today, I hope all must have realized why the Angry Middle Class has been left without any *benefits*. 82% NPA's are the legacy of the *Congress* due to which the present government is *still* struggling to get the economy on track. I hope you realize that the present government is not penalizing you _(by not giving more freebies and tax exemptions)_ but is forced due to the various economic blunders, nepotism and corruption of the *Congress* whom you all are suddenly considering to be your *savior* from the *honest BJP government*. If today, you still believe that the BJP government does not deserve a 2nd term, then *you* are really not deserving of an honest government and country. If you still believe that you need to vote out the BJP then God bless you all because then *even God cannot save this country*.

3/16/18, 7:25 AM - Bisvarup: For every point you write, there should be a reason
3/16/18, 7:26 AM - Bisvarup: Like if ma'am asks you why  did you do this ( some xyz stuff ) your answer should not be such that
*Ma'am it was there is the clueless document*
3/16/18, 7:26 AM - Bisvarup: Understand what you doing

3/16/18, 8:07 AM - Bisvarup: Na, thk ache
3/16/18, 8:07 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Sorry for being late.
3/16/18, 8:07 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Btw as far as nodejs is concerned
3/16/18, 8:08 AM - Bisvarup: Answer this*
3/16/18, 8:10 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Currently we are working on learning nodejs, it's a work in progress... Today we will sit with it along with the sequence diagram as well.
3/16/18, 8:12 AM - Bisvarup: *Dev team* since we have to submit deliverables do try to finish the deliverables first,
3/16/18, 8:12 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Means class diagram and seq diagram
3/16/18, 8:12 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Should we prioritise that.
3/16/18, 8:16 AM - Bisvarup: Class diagram sequence diagram and conceptual model
3/16/18, 8:17 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Ok.
3/16/18, 8:17 AM - Bisvarup: As these have deadlines, so we have to finish them before the deadline
3/16/18, 8:17 AM - Bisvarup: As far as node js we also have to learn them, possibly in our free time
3/16/18, 8:18 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): We will do it today evening... Class diagram is done already... Sequence diagram and conceptual model are something we will work today.
3/16/18, 8:20 AM - Bisvarup: That's ok, do keep in mind that you may have to use visual paradigm and may have to research the topic, so do allocate sufficient time for it.
3/16/18, 8:20 AM - Bisvarup: Also k kon part tay ki kolo do keep a note, we need to provide it to the QA team
3/16/18, 8:20 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Research?
3/16/18, 8:20 AM - Bisvarup: Do you know what a conceptual model is
3/16/18, 8:22 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): I'll use the stuff done by clueless
3/16/18, 8:22 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): And try to learn
3/16/18, 8:23 AM - Bisvarup: *dev team* I assume you don't know, just as I don't know, what conceptual model and sequence diagram is, so it will take some time and research to figure that part out.
3/16/18, 8:23 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Also I'll still probably do some research.
3/16/18, 8:23 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Tomorrow we can discussion with mam about it.
3/16/18, 8:24 AM - Bisvarup: Alright,
3/16/18, 8:24 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): While we may continue our research but there's no point in starting a seq diagram if class diagram is not approved
3/16/18, 8:24 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): PM, how much project plan have you done so far
3/16/18, 8:26 AM - Bisvarup: I don't think you need to get the class diagram approved to get started with the sequence diagram.
3/16/18, 8:26 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Fine, we will get it started.
3/16/18, 8:27 AM - Bisvarup: Class diagram and sequence diagram, as far as I know, is not interdependent
3/16/18, 8:27 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Probably we will finish the seq diagram by tonight, atleast roughly over pen and pepper.
3/16/18, 8:28 AM - Bisvarup: @everyone for my part I have completed the project plan and Gantt chart about 70%
3/16/18, 8:28 AM - Bisvarup: Fine..
3/16/18, 8:28 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Great work.
3/16/18, 8:29 AM - Bisvarup: *heads up* for everyone
3/16/18, 8:29 AM - Bisvarup: *QA team* read this
3/16/18, 8:29 AM - Bisvarup: Guys let the QA team read and reply to this
3/16/18, 8:33 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Yes, guys... My suggestion is do research from internet first, if the date from the internet matches the stuff done by clueless,great...if it doesn't ...follow the net, not clueless.
3/16/18, 8:33 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): That'll be my sujjestion.
3/16/18, 8:51 AM - Bisvarup: Conceptual model may also be called domain modeling.
3/16/18, 8:51 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Let's c.

3/16/18, 6:34 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): I'll "not"show the seq diagram to any members because it could create too many opinions thereby hindering the progress.
3/16/18, 6:34 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): I'll show it directly to mam, and we will have a discussion with her about it.
3/16/18, 6:41 PM - Bisvarup: *dev team* as a project manager I request you to share the documents by 20:00
3/16/18, 6:41 PM - Bisvarup: In case the *dev team* has other plans please mail me the reason stating the decision.
3/16/18, 6:43 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Well, it could be 20:30 to 21:00.
3/16/18, 6:44 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): However, we will try to get it done as fast as possible.
3/16/18, 6:48 PM - Bisvarup: It is ok, I don't expect the teams ( Dev and QA ) to finish the work before 20:00 
I am you guys to show how much of the work is done

This is important for the following reasons
1. I need to know how much progress the team has made
2. If someone needs help,  we can sort it out.
3/16/18, 6:49 PM - Junaed: QA has done their part except process description part
3/16/18, 6:49 PM - Bisvarup: Yes,
3/16/18, 6:49 PM - Junaed: which apparenly we need bisho's help but was actually assigned to Debjit

3/16/18, 10:19 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): We want to speed up our progress, so we need to skip certain less important aspects if  we want to get the final implementation done

3/20/18, 10:03 PM - Bisvarup: Guys
3/20/18, 10:03 PM - Bisvarup: The GitHub page
3/20/18, 10:03 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Pk pk.
3/20/18, 10:03 PM - Bisvarup: Client registration module 90%ish done
3/20/18, 10:50 PM - Bisvarup: *Login* registration module of client 90%ish complete
3/21/18, 10:29 AM - Bisvarup: Guys, since the design Lab project is a team initiative, so it is not just our personal battles, it is the team's war. 
So sometimes it may so happen inspite we won our own battles, we lost the war. So if we survive we survive as a team. The only way the team can survive is through communication and coordination.

Everyone in the team has to be on the same page, otherwise it is difficult to coordinate. If there is any problem report to your immediate managers. 

For example suppose Debjit is a ninja at testing. He tested all the modules, but if junaed does not know about it then we won't be able to put it infront of ma'am. His work will go to a waste. Another example is suppose the *dev team*  forgot to share the design docs, the *QA* team will not able to make the test cases. So it is very important to report your work, as someone may be there depending on your work.
3/21/18, 10:32 AM - Bisvarup: One more thing, it is better for the internal team to find the bugs and faults in design, rather than someone from outside, say auditer or customer or stakeholder, reporting bugs.
3/21/18, 10:36 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): This is not something new you have said, but as the Dev teams houses are close to college relatively... We have access to the mentor of mentors  which is mam herself... So we can report our progress to her as well, so my  suggestion to those who's houses are not too far away from college, to come to college as often as possible and have a consultation with mam, along with having frequent consultation with our PM.
3/21/18, 10:38 AM - Junaed: Seta actually "korle" toh khub valo hoye
3/21/18, 10:39 AM - Bisvarup: @917980325968 get the design documents from the *dev team* once they are done, thank you

4/2/18, 11:01 AM - Junaed: Na na ultimately integration testing e atkabe
4/2/18, 11:01 AM - Junaed: Coz Otar test report like hobe
4/2/18, 11:02 AM - Bisvarup: Just check if the srs has any problems or not. Don't worry about the term baseline. Check conceptually it's correct or not. Check if the flow is ok and the statements are atomic verifiable or not
4/2/18, 11:02 AM - Bisvarup: Ota will be a later portion. It need not be worried at this moment
4/2/18, 11:03 AM - Junaed: Satyam told me that they dev team is to design test cases and qa write test plan(says that's what Wong said to them) though I don't believe it coz as far as my knowledge goes both are to b done by qa
4/2/18, 11:03 AM - Junaed: I agree
4/2/18, 11:03 AM - Junaed: Flow bolte?
4/2/18, 11:04 AM - Bisvarup: Flow of events
4/2/18, 11:04 AM - Bisvarup: QA team will design test cases.
4/2/18, 11:05 AM - Bisvarup: Dev team will write unit tests
4/2/18, 11:05 AM - Bisvarup: The QA team need not coordinate with the dev team regarding unit tests

4/3/18, 4:32 PM - Bisvarup: *dev team* ma'am kintu ask korbe k kon module ba part ta implement koreche, so sincerely go through the technologies ( JavaScript and node js ) nato it will be difficult for you guys
4/4/18, 8:52 AM - Bisvarup: @919804964795 get together with your team ( @917003101218  and @919433415698 ) and figure out how to solve the design document problem
4/4/18, 8:52 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Pk.
4/4/18, 8:53 AM - Bisvarup: I understand ma'am said, it can be done later, first focus on the implementation, but do understand that, that is a backlog and it needs to be cleared asap.
4/4/18, 8:54 AM - Bisvarup: I will continue with the implementation, till Saturday, by then you figure out the solution of design documents
4/4/18, 8:55 AM - Bisvarup: What I am planning is, *Saturday* we will show the *updated design documents* and the *code (implementation)* running in my computer.
4/4/18, 8:55 AM - Bisvarup: For the *dev team*
4/4/18, 8:57 AM - Bisvarup: @917980325968 ma'am sent the test link username and password, I believe you can start with the test cases now, get your team together and start working on it.
4/4/18, 8:59 AM - Bisvarup: So 
*dev team* Saturday design documents.

*QA* team Tuesday *test plan and test cases*
4/4/18, 9:01 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): No.. we cannot guarantee sorry... Because to fix the design document we may need Madam's help.
4/4/18, 9:02 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Its better we do something related to the implantation.
4/4/18, 9:09 AM - Junaed: I still didn't receive my ID and password
4/4/18, 9:09 AM - Junaed: I still didn't receive my ID and password*
4/4/18, 9:10 AM - Junaed: Ma'am didn't mail it yet are u sure ma'am said she would mail it
4/4/18, 9:37 AM - Bisvarup: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 9:37 AM - Bisvarup: @917980325968
4/4/18, 9:39 AM - Bisvarup: Unfortunately this is not negotiable at this moment, do visit ma'am today or Friday, or Google or ask any friend and get the design documents done, it had to be completed last to last Saturday,
4/4/18, 9:41 AM - Bisvarup: I don't know anything about implantation, but at this moment I don't think you and your team delaying the implementation for 3 more days will affect the overall timeline
4/4/18, 9:41 AM - Bisvarup: *dev team* please finish the design documents *asap* then you can start with the implementation
4/4/18, 11:33 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Bro... Implementation is paramount..we were told by madam to currently focus on it..I don't think it'll be worth spending time on something that's not too important anyways.
4/4/18, 11:36 AM - Bisvarup: @919804964795  call me, I shall clarify your doubt why we should first complete the design​ documents. And you can explain your point as well
4/4/18, 11:37 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Ok..Dara khanikkhon.
4/4/18, 12:17 PM - Bisvarup: @everyone guys if you face any problem with the code, like *running it*  or stuff, fix a date, we can sit and  discuss. I am available on Saturdays Sundays and Tuesdays
4/4/18, 12:18 PM - Bisvarup: I was willing to conduct a session yesterday as I felt you guys needed a kickstart with the code, but it could not happen ultimately, so decide among yourselves and let me know when you are willing to sit.
4/4/18, 12:19 PM - Bisvarup: In either case, you need a Kickstarter session or not, the work cannot pause. Do Google it and start working.
4/4/18, 12:24 PM - Junaed: Guys.. It's not that we gain something by delaying the stuff right?
4/4/18, 12:24 PM - Junaed: Kothatei ache United we stand divided we call
4/4/18, 12:24 PM - Junaed: Fall*
4/4/18, 12:25 PM - Junaed: This message was deleted
4/4/18, 12:26 PM - Junaed: If u feel lost, remember the zeal we had when the project started, all of us chipped in with our part of contibutions
4/4/18, 12:29 PM - Junaed: Don't u guys wanna prove Wong ma'am incorrect who is assuming we won't be able to do well if we are using something new like node js? I believe u guys can break this incorrect conviction of ma'am
4/4/18, 2:50 PM - Bisvarup: @919804964795  ( *dev team* ) do understand the urgency of the situation and make the call by 20:00 after that it would default to my decision ( Making the design documents )
4/4/18, 8:09 PM - Bisvarup: I did not get any call from @919804964795 or the *dev team* so you guys are doing the design documents.
4/4/18, 8:09 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Yes we are.
4/4/18, 8:09 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Bro.
4/4/18, 8:09 PM - Bisvarup: @919804964795 please state your plan, how you wish to proceed.
4/4/18, 8:09 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): I've decided to do it.
4/4/18, 8:09 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Well we will be sitting with it initially tomorrow.
4/4/18, 8:10 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): If we can fix it great.
4/4/18, 8:10 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Otherwise we have to take Madam's help.

4/6/18, 9:02 AM - Bisvarup: On *Saturday*, I shall conduct a session at our *college* regarding the *technology stack* and setting up the *software*. During that time I shall help all the attendees *clear their doubts* and help them *with their work*.

4/6/18, 7:35 PM - Bisvarup: Help me get some facts cleared here,

Ma'am suggested you to ignore,
So the queries are still not cleared
4/6/18, 7:36 PM - Bisvarup: Am I right ?
4/6/18, 7:36 PM - Bisvarup: What is the status with the *implementation*
4/6/18, 7:37 PM - Bisvarup: Any member of the *dev team* can answer this
4/7/18, 7:04 AM - Bisvarup: @919804964795  and @917003101218 when you are done with your fyp, meet  me.

4/7/18, 7:05 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Maybe till 4
4/7/18, 7:05 AM - Bisvarup: Alright, then I guess I will meet you when I am done
4/7/18, 7:05 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Ok bro
4/7/18, 1:23 PM - Bisvarup: I quoted your words to ma'am. Ma'am *clearly* said design documents need to be *baselined*. And that must happen ( theoritically ) before implementation.

*Dev team* and lead developer @919804964795  focus all your energies towards making the *design documents*. The design documents need to be baselined next Tuesday.
4/7/18, 1:28 PM - Bisvarup: Also note that in today's session I explained all you need to know to get started, most of the gotchas and how to make sense of the existing code.
4/7/18, 1:29 PM - Bisvarup: This *will not* be repeated again, due to time constraints and other issues.
4/7/18, 1:30 PM - Bisvarup: Next day, I.e. Tuesday ma'am expects *one module* per developer and it's correspondence *unit test*.
4/7/18, 1:31 PM - Bisvarup: Along with design documents baselined
4/7/18, 1:32 PM - Bisvarup: @917980325968 please mention what ma'am expects regarding the *QA*
4/7/18, 1:32 PM - Bisvarup: I.E. what ma'am expects next Tuesday
4/8/18, 10:13 AM - Bisvarup: @917980325968 answer this
4/8/18, 10:14 AM - Bisvarup: @everyone, I will be unit testing the find counselor module, the other developers will work on and unit test the other modules, apart from working on design documents for Tuesday
4/8/18, 10:18 AM - Bisvarup: @919804964795 update your plan and progress regarding design documents
4/8/18, 10:54 AM - Junaed: Qa team will sodium
Design the test cases and make the test plan
4/8/18, 10:54 AM - Junaed: Test plan will b on what modules test cases will b done
4/8/18, 10:55 AM - Junaed: On Tuesday qa team is supposed to bring the test plan along with the test cases of those modules which have been done
4/8/18, 10:56 AM - Junaed: So I would urge the dev team to speed up coz soon we will catch up with u guys coz writing test cases for a module won't b very lengthy process
4/8/18, 10:56 AM - Junaed: @918372851444 let's hurry up and get our work done
4/8/18, 6:30 PM - Bisvarup: @919804964795 I need an answer
4/8/18, 6:38 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Fine.
4/8/18, 9:10 PM - Bisvarup: This is the third time I am asking you to answer the question regarding your plan for making the design documents and implementation.

Design documents should have been baselined more than one week ago.

We will be meeting this Tuesday, so  2 days left.
4/8/18, 9:14 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): This is the last time answering that we have other priorities including final year project, we have been told my mam that our design documents need to be made around 80% max, we will be making that within Tuesday.
4/8/18, 9:16 PM - Bisvarup: Every final year student has fyp, so that is not something specific to you or the dev team.
4/8/18, 9:16 PM - Bisvarup: I don't how how you interpret ma'am' words, but ma'am needs the design documents baselined. And that is not done yet.
4/8/18, 9:17 PM - Bisvarup: I don't know what 80% work you are talking about. It is either done or not done. And as of now, it is not done. And was past expected delivery date.
4/8/18, 9:19 PM - Bisvarup: And clearly you have not been able to make it within this time, so I cannot rely on you turning in the work on Tuesday. Mail me the work by Monday 20:00
4/8/18, 9:19 PM - Bisvarup: The QA and I will verify it to see if it is actually what is expected or not.
4/8/18, 9:20 PM - Bisvarup: Because clearly, all these days you guys have been understanding the requirements wrong.
4/8/18, 9:21 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): No, there may have been a miscommunication.. But we like to take matters into our hands and mam wants us to code, I'll be glad if u rather give us a guideline of how to implement and focus on the design documents yourself.
4/8/18, 9:22 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Infact last day mam told us all she wants to see now from ius is code.
4/8/18, 9:23 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Something we wish to focus on.
4/8/18, 9:24 PM - Bisvarup: I shall gladly make the design documents, the dev team's work, after communicating with ma'am
4/8/18, 9:25 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): I think, we can communicate too, on Tuesday and explain the confusion to her.
4/8/18, 9:25 PM - Bisvarup: I shall explain the situation to ma'am that, lead developer is not willing to make the design documents. In that case what should I do.
4/8/18, 9:26 PM - Bisvarup: I don't understand the confusion, ma'am' instructions are pretty clear to me
4/8/18, 9:28 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Well we have separate instructions from mam who incidently also happens to be our fyp mentor, it's best you do your thing.. We do ours, and have a direct discussion with mam.. We have been trying to show the design documents to her ... But she's like "I want code".. So.. Let's discuss with her day after tomorrow.
4/8/18, 9:28 PM - Bisvarup: My thing, is to get the project done, as the role of the project manager
4/8/18, 9:29 PM - Bisvarup: And this is my work, getting the dev team to do it's job
4/8/18, 9:29 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Ok, as you wish.. You will get the design document tomorrow.
4/8/18, 9:29 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): And u better show it too.
4/8/18, 9:29 PM - Bisvarup: Show what
4/8/18, 9:30 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Get it baselined*
4/8/18, 9:30 PM - Bisvarup: Mail the design documents by 20:00
4/8/18, 9:30 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): We will send u the work you get it baselined.
4/8/18, 9:30 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): 👍
4/8/18, 9:30 PM - Bisvarup: The dev team will be there with ma'am along with the pm to get the design documents baselined
4/8/18, 9:31 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Ok,in the meanwhile some guidance on how to proceed with the development purpose would serve us well.
4/8/18, 9:31 PM - Bisvarup: Is this instruction clear ?
Then I shall proceed to your query regarding implementation
4/8/18, 9:32 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Yes.
4/8/18, 9:32 PM - Bisvarup: For this call me,
4/8/18, 9:33 PM - Bisvarup: Dev team you will get the instructions from your *lead developer*
4/8/18, 9:33 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem (New): Will do.
4/8/18, 9:36 PM - Bisvarup: And just to be clear, according to ma'am' separation of role, the dev team is in charge of the implementation. I am making the implementation till now, just to help the dev team.

The dev team is free to choose any language or tool to make the project. As long as it is complete.

If the dev team wishes to build on my work, they can, else they can start from scratch themselves. 

My work is just a starter or help to the dev team.
4/9/18, 7:20 AM - Bisvarup: *dev team* apart from making the design documents, which are to be submitted by 20:00, make the homepage of the platform.
4/9/18, 7:21 AM - Bisvarup: The technologies needed to make homepage is HTML, css
4/9/18, 7:21 AM - Bisvarup: *Homepage*: the page which is displayed when entering the domain name.

4/9/18, 8:47 PM - Bisvarup: *QA* I mailed you the .Vpp file which barunabha sent
4/9/18, 8:47 PM - Bisvarup: You have to check the design document.
4/9/18, 8:48 PM - Bisvarup: This is what you have to check,
1. If on adding some attribute in sequence diagram is it automatically getting added in class diagram.
2. If on changing something in class diagram is it automatically getting reflected in sequence diagram
4/9/18, 8:49 PM - Bisvarup: Check this and let me know by 23:59 as if there is any problem we have to ask the dev team to fix it
4/9/18, 8:49 PM - Bisvarup: I will also be taking a look into it.
4/9/18, 8:59 PM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 call @919804964795 once you are available, we have been facing difficulty reaching you today.

4/9/18, 10:08 PM - Bisvarup: Whatever 80% you are taking about, I don't know that, but last day ma'am clearly said ma'am wanted that feature and that is the reason the design docs are not baselined by her.
4/9/18, 10:09 PM - Bisvarup: Last day when I asked ma'am, this is exactly what she told me, and I have been telling this to you and your team ever since, although I have been telling this to you since last Tuesday

4/10/18, 7:31 PM - Debjit Paul: Junaid and I decided that we would go to college on Saturday bcs there was not too much work to show today...but we are going to the college tomorrow to attend mam's session
4/10/18, 7:36 PM - Bisvarup: @918372851444 and *everyone* Tuesday is the day when every team member goes to college to attend ma'am' briefing. And discussion of work. 
Because the dev team needs to talk to me, the QA needs to talk to the dev
I need to talk to the dev and QA 

We all go to college on Tuesdays. This is also the day we have our team meetings.
4/10/18, 7:36 PM - Junaed: I had different reason for not going tho...
4/10/18, 7:37 PM - Junaed: I said to u since there ain't much work to go.. So will u go there? @918372851444 that's what I asked
4/10/18, 7:37 PM - Bisvarup: Hence, @918372851444 and others we cannot take arbitrary leaves.
4/10/18, 7:37 PM - Junaed: Had I known what would have happened today I would have persuaded ya to go pal
4/10/18, 7:37 PM - Junaed: Agree 👍

4/10/18, 7:39 PM - Debjit Paul: Sorry my bad ... won't happen again
4/10/18, 7:40 PM - Junaed: I think there has been some miscommunication, it was me who called u and asked about it
4/10/18, 7:40 PM - Junaed: More so coz u didn't have Ur system installed which bisho did on my. Machine last Saturday
4/10/18, 7:41 PM - Junaed: And also to show u Ofc how the test link website works
4/10/18, 7:45 PM - Debjit Paul: I don't deny any of that but these are out of context bisho asked me the reason and I simply stated ...why are you being so paranoid ...we are attending tomorrow right!!??
4/10/18, 7:53 PM - Bisvarup: Well debjit there is reason for paranoia
1. Your system does not have dev environment set up
2. You cannot test without dev environment
3. This week is the tentative date to show test plan and test cases
4. Some other groups are done with their test cases.
5. You guys have no idea about the modules that even need to be tested, for this you need to talk to the devs.
4/10/18, 7:54 PM - Bisvarup: Anyways Kal class kor dujon.. and kono jayga bhujte na parle ask questions to ma'am
4/10/18, 7:55 PM - Junaed: yup we are attending tomorrow ..lets drop the discussion now

4/10/18, 9:26 PM - Bisvarup: Instead we will be using 

https://hubl.in/
4/10/18, 9:26 PM - Bisvarup: We may have to change use case diagram or some documents in the process
4/10/18, 9:27 PM - Bisvarup: Next day I shall put forward this idea and finalize it.
4/11/18, 8:36 PM - Bisvarup: *dev team* brace yourselves, *QA* is writing some badass test cases 😱

4/13/18, 9:14 AM - Bisvarup: Last day before leaving, you asked me *amay ki korte Hobe bol Ami korbo/aschi*
4/13/18, 9:14 AM - Bisvarup: So i assumed you meant kon module as that is your role.
4/13/18, 9:15 AM - Bisvarup: For that I suggested peer motivator, and you agreed and left.
4/13/18, 9:16 AM - Bisvarup: And with peer motivator what you mean is making the module where the client is given a peer motivator based on his query and availability of the peer motivator
4/13/18, 9:16 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: You have not suggested, you said "DO", as I can remember
4/13/18, 9:17 AM - Bisvarup: No arnab it was a suggestion, anyways you can still choose now

4/15/18, 7:59 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Wait.. I'll call u a bit towards the afternoon.
4/15/18, 8:00 AM - Bisvarup: You need to do these

2. Make the *unit tests* in your branch
3. Create a *pull request*
4/15/18, 8:00 AM - Bisvarup: The words in bold are the keywords, you need to Google bases on these keywords.
4/15/18, 8:07 AM - Bisvarup: I have been trying to code the rest of the software since yesterday, and it's kinda very big ( lot to do )

4/16/18, 1:53 PM - Bisvarup: *dev team* update the work which you have done, and will be showing to ma'am tomorrow
4/16/18, 5:32 PM - Bisvarup: If *dev team* does not update work done, then dev team is not doing any work in my knowledge, and I shall communicate the same to ma'am.

Then lead developer shall be the spokesperson when we shall have the conversation with ma'am ( regarding work done my members )
4/16/18, 8:52 PM - Bisvarup: <Media omitted>
4/16/18, 8:55 PM - Bisvarup: For *dev team*
4/16/18, 9:09 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: I will talk to mam we are having some problems as of now.
4/16/18, 9:12 PM - Bisvarup: May I know what problems is the dev team facing as of now
4/16/18, 9:13 PM - Bisvarup: *dev team* we have much more work than just writing unit tests.
4/16/18, 9:13 PM - Bisvarup: I suggested you guys to write unit tests for tomorrow.
4/16/18, 9:14 PM - Bisvarup: If you guys are planning to show something on some other day, it has to be much more than unit tests, some functionality maybe
4/16/18, 9:23 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: <Media omitted>
4/16/18, 9:25 PM - Bisvarup: Kotokhn phone paoya jaay ni ?
4/16/18, 9:26 PM - Bisvarup: As far as I remember evening 6:00om to 7:30pm phone off chilo
4/16/18, 9:26 PM - Bisvarup: Did any of you call apart from this time ?
4/16/18, 9:40 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: No we didn't.
4/16/18, 9:40 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Anyways no big deal.
4/16/18, 9:40 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: It's best if we come tomorrow get the shit sorted out and work some important stuff on Friday.
4/16/18, 9:41 PM - Bisvarup: Actually the deal is big, not to be taken lightly
4/16/18, 9:41 PM - Bisvarup: Because
4/16/18, 9:41 PM - Bisvarup: Tomorrow is release v0.1
4/16/18, 9:42 PM - Bisvarup: If you check GitHub dates, you can see I started the work about 27days ago
4/16/18, 9:42 PM - Bisvarup: So you guys had time, to learn.
4/16/18, 9:43 PM - Bisvarup: And it is going to be a problem for the team if on release v0.1 the dev team has no clue about the code
4/16/18, 9:45 PM - Bisvarup: And at this moment, instead of procrastination if the dev team can spend a few hours learning about git and Jasmine it would do good for the team
4/16/18, 9:52 PM - Barunabha 3: Are ajker big deal
4/16/18, 9:52 PM - Barunabha 3: Nitesh rana half century kre6e
4/16/18, 9:53 PM - Barunabha 3: R Russell 12 bol e 41
4/16/18, 9:53 PM - Bisvarup: Did not get you Barunabha, are you trying to crack a joke ?

4/16/18, 9:56 PM - Barunabha 3: Ipl dekh
4/16/18, 9:56 PM - Barunabha 3: Kolkata 200
4/16/18, 9:57 PM - Bisvarup: I hope you understand the state the dev team is currently at. The day before release v0.1 the dev team is clueless. I don't think any responsible and sensible member would consider this an appropriate time for joke or game updates.
4/16/18, 9:58 PM - Bisvarup: And specifically, you Barunabha, you are still not a contributor on our repository.
4/16/18, 9:58 PM - Bisvarup: Even after being in the dev team
4/16/18, 9:58 PM - Barunabha 3: Tui Kal blle Ami ki krbo?
4/16/18, 9:58 PM - Barunabha 3: Holiday te
4/16/18, 9:59 PM - Bisvarup: So it boils down to, a member of the dev team is not even part of the development process.
4/16/18, 9:59 PM - Bisvarup: Nothing, you continue doing nothing
4/16/18, 9:59 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Dara Bhai.. This is a serious issue...I as a lead Dev take responsibility and have a discussion with mam tomorrow for a small extension, so that we can start off with our work properly.
4/16/18, 9:59 PM - Barunabha 3: Tui vulval somoye blbi to ki krbo?
4/16/18, 10:00 PM - Bisvarup: As I said, do not do anything.
4/16/18, 10:00 PM - Barunabha 3: Are baba 2din age blle Kno chap I hto na
4/16/18, 10:01 PM - Bisvarup: Being a developer, you are still not part of the development and source control procedure, even on the last day before release 0.1
4/16/18, 10:01 PM - Bisvarup: This itself summarizes it all
4/16/18, 10:54 PM - Bisvarup: Kal uniform e ashte hobe

4/17/18, 1:25 PM - Bisvarup: Lead developer, as per your statement today, infront of ma'am, which was much different than what we have in the group chat, you said you have some questions for me, project manager
4/17/18, 1:25 PM - Bisvarup: Ask me
4/17/18, 1:26 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: When did I say I have questions from mam.i said I'll talk to mam.
4/17/18, 1:26 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Which is again totally different.
4/17/18, 1:30 PM - Bisvarup: You asked me one question, which I answered, are there any further ?
4/17/18, 1:32 PM - Bisvarup: So I am assuming no more doubts
4/17/18, 1:34 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: As of now no more, whilw coding we may face more and you are responsible to help us. We clearly told mam that we are having probs with the stuff, so if you don't provide the help we can have a discussion with mam.
One more thing, you're forgetting that we are working for the welfare of the team and building on an interesting concept. Instead of keeping grudges and being too formal we can work together for the success of the team.
4/17/18, 1:35 PM - Bisvarup: I don't understand and know about grudges but I shall provide you materials you need to implement.
4/17/18, 1:36 PM - Bisvarup: I had a session before where I taught our group members the stuff on which none of the developers came
4/17/18, 1:36 PM - Bisvarup: I won't have any more sessions due to constraint of time
4/17/18, 1:37 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: I'm having a discussion with madam right now.

4/25/18, 8:48 AM - Bisvarup: Cool
4/25/18, 10:51 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: I've requested arnab to write the unit test for login module.
4/25/18, 11:13 AM - Bisvarup: Alright @918777033152
4/25/18, 11:13 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 try to finish it by today so that if you have any problems you can report to gaurav tomorrow
4/25/18, 12:11 PM - Arnab Nandy 2: Sorry Guys I was Busy for FYP today morning also for testing purpose. Now its over. I will start work in unit test from today afternoon.
4/25/18, 8:55 PM - Bisvarup: @918777033152 I did not get @917003101218's assigned task
4/26/18, 7:32 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: I will not be assigning any task to him .
4/26/18, 7:57 AM - Bisvarup: May I know the reason ? Is there anything  i can do to solve this issue
4/26/18, 7:58 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: No, it's just a decision taken by the team , if you have a problem we can still assign him something.
4/26/18, 8:01 AM - Bisvarup: Yes, everyone has to contribute. When the code review takes place everyone's code will be reviewed by ma'am.
4/26/18, 8:02 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Ok.
4/26/18, 8:02 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Then arnab and barunabha can contribute with the login system together.
4/26/18, 8:02 AM - Bisvarup: If you do not assign any task to him he will not be able to show anything and hence code review for the entire *team* shall be incomplete.
4/26/18, 8:03 AM - Bisvarup: As per the instructions of  ma'am every developer has to build a module himself
4/26/18, 8:03 AM - Bisvarup: Both cannot share the same module
4/26/18, 8:04 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Ok, then barunabha should work on the register peer motivator module.
4/26/18, 8:04 AM - Bisvarup: Alright
4/26/18, 8:05 AM - Bisvarup: @917003101218  make sure you get your module from @918777033152  as you need to appear for code review on Saturday where you will be explaining your code.
4/26/18, 8:06 AM - Bisvarup: *dev team* wrap up your work by Friday so that we  need not spend time Saturday fixing test cases ( like what happened last week )
4/26/18, 8:07 AM - Bisvarup: 1. Make sure the tests pass
2. *Do not* push to master branch
4/26/18, 8:07 AM - Junaed: yes it's a request from me too  *@dev team*
4/26/18, 8:07 AM - Bisvarup: 3. Work on separate branches
4/26/18, 8:07 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: I am starting now
4/26/18, 8:09 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 you may take help form the other developers while making test cases but jokhn ma'am k dekhate Hobe login system er test cases e just Tor naam e Hobe.

ETA e bola Hobe only *arnab* has made the login system test cases.




~same goes for poddar and his test case
4/26/18, 8:09 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Sure
4/27/18, 1:40 PM - Bisvarup: @918372851444  please give us an estimate when you will get back your laptop from repair center .
4/27/18, 5:23 PM - Bisvarup: @everyone, since the *QA* will not be able to come tomorrow and we need the *QA*  for version 0.2 and code review hence we will not be meeting tomorrow
4/27/18, 5:24 PM - Bisvarup: We shall be meeting next Tuesday for code review and version 0.2
4/28/18, 7:25 AM - Bisvarup: Debjit answer this
4/28/18, 7:26 AM - Bisvarup: @918777033152 talk to your developers and let me know by 18:00 what is the extent of assigned work done by each of the developers ( including you )
4/28/18, 8:24 AM - Debjit Paul: Monday around 11 AM
4/28/18, 8:34 AM - Bisvarup: Ok
4/28/18, 4:24 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: I have messaged barun and arnab
4/28/18, 4:24 PM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: It'll be great if they response quickly.
4/28/18, 4:26 PM - Arnab Nandy 2: I have tried to do login page unit test case code but could not done. I have asked Poddar for help but he could not.
4/28/18, 4:27 PM - Bisvarup: Set up a meeting with lead developer
4/28/18, 4:28 PM - Bisvarup: Communicate with the lead developer which part and till how much you tried to do before you got stuck.
4/28/18, 4:37 PM - Arnab Nandy 2: Okk
4/28/18, 4:42 PM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 @917003101218 and @918777033152  this is addressing the dev team.

Do understand that you have to go though some tutorials to understand the concepts so that you can do your part. 
If that means spending a few sleepless nights to understand some concept, you need to do that.

When it is time to turn in work, saying you could not do it is not acceptable as anyone can do it if he spends time *trying* to understand the language.

Next day when we meet for code review each of the developers need to have code for themselves. By code I mean working code which fits with the modules otherwise it would seem to ma'am the person did not contribute to the coding at all. Then expect to be graded accordingly.
4/28/18, 11:16 PM - Bisvarup: @918777033152  did you talk to @919433415698  to know till how much he has done before he got stuck ?
4/29/18, 8:10 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Arnab where are you stuck? And barun how much have you progressed so far.
4/29/18, 8:21 AM - Barunabha 3: Ami vai guardians of galaxy dkhlam
4/29/18, 8:21 AM - Barunabha 3: Aj black panther dkhbo sokale
4/29/18, 8:21 AM - Barunabha 3: Tale avengers vlo kre bujhte prbo
4/29/18, 8:23 AM - Junaed: Projectplan.pod
4/29/18, 8:23 AM - Junaed: 😛
4/29/18, 8:23 AM - Bisvarup: @917003101218 answer what is being asked. Do understand that the sole purpose of this group is to have discussion related to design Lab.
4/29/18, 8:23 AM - Junaed: Yup...follow the project plan @917003101218
4/29/18, 8:25 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 and @917003101218  if you do not supply answers to the question asked by the lead developer, then the action shall be reported.
4/29/18, 8:26 AM - Bisvarup: And @917003101218 one more irrelevant comment and I shall personally take the responsibility to report it to ma'am next day, after that you will be out of this group.
4/29/18, 9:13 AM - Barunabha 3: Tui ki 5 bo6orer choto baccha
4/29/18, 9:13 AM - Barunabha 3: Kothay kothay ma k bole dbo
4/29/18, 9:18 AM - Bisvarup: Irrelevant comment yet again @917003101218
4/29/18, 9:37 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: I have  tried to write the unit test code, but creating unit test code is getting impossible for me what I understood, as I tried many times still error. So, I have decided, I am not going to write any unit test code. As I am very weak in coding also declared before starting the project as well as team formation time. Anything else in developer section that I know and I can, I will be glad to complete that work if that assign to me in future.
4/29/18, 9:42 AM - Bisvarup: As for stating you are weak in coding, yes you stated, but again it was your choice to stay in the team as a developer, you could have chosen another team anytime, then.
4/29/18, 9:43 AM - Bisvarup: *I have tried many times still error*
I want to see your failed attempts. Show the code which you tried but did not work
4/29/18, 9:44 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Arnab-me,barun.. Even junaed we are not great at coding either. But you should try to your level best, try to take help from the PM whose actually good at it.
4/29/18, 9:44 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Who's
4/29/18, 9:45 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Because that time You told QA is more difficult position and QA also needs to the whole code and needs to be more expert that developers in development. But what actually not and I am seeing now that.
4/29/18, 9:45 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Sure
4/29/18, 9:46 AM - Bisvarup: That was my understanding back then, anyway as the title suggests, developer, you are expected to *code*.

So when you take up the role, as stated then also, you are expected to code.
4/29/18, 9:46 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: You are interested to learn Node and new tings all, but its not make any interest to me. So, I could not probably.
4/29/18, 9:47 AM - Bisvarup: Alright @919433415698  correct me if I am wrong. 

Since node does not interest you, hence you did not put in an effort to learn it. So now you cannot code.
Am I right ?
4/29/18, 9:48 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Yes, I have done HTML CSS code past in this project as lead said to do. So, I will do what I can.
4/29/18, 9:49 AM - Bisvarup: I don't understand the part
*I will do what I can*
4/29/18, 9:49 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Already said I tried to understand but not getting any interest.
4/29/18, 9:49 AM - Bisvarup: Please elaborate
4/29/18, 9:50 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Arnab , atleast try...we are all trying .. We are not great at it either... Just keep trying .. Effort is appreciated.
4/29/18, 9:50 AM - Bisvarup: Alright so basically what @919433415698  is saying is since he does not get interest in node he shall not contribute to the development of the project.
4/29/18, 9:53 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: You lead and managers are going to assign work to me, Now I will try, as this time also I tried, If possible I will finish the task and if not possible I will declare that it is not possible for me as today I declared. So, here time will not get wasted. Someone else can complete that work.
4/29/18, 9:54 AM - Bisvarup: Unfortunately this won't happen as you being a developer you have to contribute to the development of the project. 

If we do not get any working code from you then you are not contributing. 

So it is either you produce some code or you don't
4/29/18, 9:55 AM - Bisvarup: Anyways show the failed attempts.
4/29/18, 9:55 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: <Media omitted>
4/29/18, 9:59 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Have I said anything wrong?
4/29/18, 10:01 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Yes, I said before staring project and team formation, I will not learn node and contribute will be tough then. So give me QA position where no coding part and you misguided me. Now you are forcing me to learn. Where that time you have not said "you have to code". I said we will do as a team and what required if madam asking anything to me, I will manage and then individually has to work not told.
4/29/18, 10:02 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Listen to this please
4/29/18, 10:05 AM - Junaed: No point in complaining about nodejs now
4/29/18, 10:05 AM - Junaed: We all decided it together
4/29/18, 10:06 AM - Junaed: When we  started the project
4/29/18, 10:06 AM - Junaed: We chose nodejs over php
4/29/18, 10:06 AM - Junaed: It's our own decision
4/29/18, 10:07 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: When I have told these words to Bisho, you were absent at Gourav's house. So, please don't enter now.
4/29/18, 10:08 AM - Junaed: Oh yeah u are showing me attendance?
4/29/18, 10:08 AM - Junaed: Look who's speaking
4/29/18, 10:09 AM - Junaed: Don't make me laugh
4/29/18, 10:09 AM - Bisvarup: You said you will not learn node, when we met at gaurav's place for making the video. That was a few weeks into the project which means a few weeks after it was decided you will be a developer.

And just to refresh your memory. We decided upon node after the project started so your statement saying you said you won't learn node  before team formation is baseless.


Now for the last time *a developer is expected to CODE, so when you take up a role as a developer you are expected to code. And I at no point assured you that you need not code*

And again for the last time *no one Forced you to join the team as a developer, it was YOUR choice. You could have left anytime*

Please elaborate how I misguided you.
4/29/18, 10:09 AM - Junaed: Yup I 👍
4/29/18, 10:10 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Guys
4/29/18, 10:11 AM - Junaed: @918777033152 I would like to mention one thing
4/29/18, 10:11 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: <Media omitted>
4/29/18, 10:11 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: I am not showing you attendance, don't take in wrong way. I just wanted to mean, Where you don't know what was the communication, how you are commenting on that?
4/29/18, 10:11 AM - Junaed: Abolish the term "ordinary" it holds no use for current generation
4/29/18, 10:12 AM - Junaed: One person didn't decide if node js will b used or not its a team decision... I can't understand y didn't u join me @919433415698

4/29/18, 10:16 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Ok, then as per my lead, I am trying and I don't know it will ever get finished or not. So, you guys are trying to make everything complicated. So, lets do that.
4/29/18, 10:16 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Exactly. We are all here to cover up the mistakes, effort is what we desire as a team.
4/29/18, 10:16 AM - Barunabha 3: Vai amr 1ta 6oto ktha

4/29/18, 10:18 AM - Junaed: Exactly
4/29/18, 10:19 AM - Barunabha 3: Kal dupurer mddhe Ami rough code lead k diye dbo
4/29/18, 10:19 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 has some really interesting points and insights, I need to learn those.
4/29/18, 10:19 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Fine, make sure there are no syntax errors
4/29/18, 10:19 AM - Barunabha 3: That I think I can do
4/29/18, 10:19 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 please answer
4/29/18, 10:22 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: I did not said "You guys making complication for me", I said the whole project in way you are doing.
4/29/18, 10:22 AM - Bisvarup: Which subpart is assigned to you ?
4/29/18, 10:22 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Login unit test
4/29/18, 10:22 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Yes
4/29/18, 10:23 AM - Bisvarup: How does it matter how the rest of the system is implemented, you just have to make your portion
4/29/18, 10:23 AM - Bisvarup: To make your portion you need not bother about the rest of the system
4/29/18, 10:23 AM - Bisvarup: So how exactly are you getting intimidated by the project
4/29/18, 10:25 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Yes, that I do always.
4/29/18, 10:25 AM - Bisvarup: Please state one assigned coding task which you did completely
4/29/18, 10:26 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698  I conducted two sessions to teach node, in how many of them were you present ?
4/29/18, 10:27 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Manage counselor, Manage PM both HTML page, Last time HomePage also. Ask my lead.
4/29/18, 10:28 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Time not matched
4/29/18, 10:28 AM - Bisvarup: All of them were useless as they were made with HTML and the code had PHP In it, which was again wrong.

Except the home page which will be used.
4/29/18, 10:29 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: If, useless then why asked to make me?
4/29/18, 10:29 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Guys don't make these personal
4/29/18, 10:29 AM - Bisvarup: In the first session you were absent and yet you did not inform me before hand. In the second session you left halfway.
4/29/18, 10:30 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: because there you were wasting time
4/29/18, 10:30 AM - Bisvarup: I never asked anyone to make you.

Apart from that you are expected to make some code which works if it doesn't work it is useless. And since you are a developer you have to code. So the lead developer perhaps asked you to make
4/29/18, 10:31 AM - Bisvarup: If teaching node is wasting time  according to you ?
4/29/18, 10:31 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: It was asked me to made by my lead. And works perfectly lead said then.
4/29/18, 10:32 AM - Bisvarup: Unfortunately perhaps he miscalculated, it doesn't work. So net result is except home page nothing works
4/29/18, 10:32 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: <Media omitted>
4/29/18, 10:33 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: We are going nowhere with this conversation
4/29/18, 10:33 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: No, time waste in sense that we were present there to learn and you are talking QA team over phone. Phone can be done after the session also but you did not and said call is important than the session.
4/29/18, 10:35 AM - Bisvarup: Being a project manager I have responsibility towards dev team and QA team. 
So to perform my responsibilities I have to communicate with both the teams. 

Now, speaking of the call it was no more than 5 minutes in a more than one hour session.
4/29/18, 10:37 AM - Bisvarup: And teaching the dev team node was a voluntary work, it was not in my responsibility section. 

Now what you mean to say is you felt the session was a waste of time because the project manager had to talk to the QA for matters regarding project
4/29/18, 10:37 AM - Bisvarup: ?
4/29/18, 10:37 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: You PM, your wish. I did not like, so I left. Its quite simple, still you are rubbing it.
4/29/18, 10:38 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Always @918013069900 will correct and others are incorrect thats not possible man.
4/29/18, 10:38 AM - Bisvarup: The fact your contribution is nearly zero is also quite simple to understand.
4/29/18, 10:39 AM - Bisvarup: Please explain where I was wrong
4/29/18, 10:39 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: That's upto you.
4/29/18, 10:39 AM - Barunabha 3: Eta barabari
4/29/18, 10:39 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Not interested to explain.
4/29/18, 10:39 AM - Bisvarup: State the coding tasks you did and your work shall speak for yourself. I need not say what all you did.
4/29/18, 10:40 AM - Bisvarup: Then your statement is again baseless.
4/29/18, 10:41 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: That also upto you.
4/29/18, 10:42 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Enough talked today, now I need other work also. So, leaving now. And next day I will talk to maam, what does "TEAM" means?  Hope your problem @918013069900 will be resolved.
4/29/18, 10:42 AM - Junaed: <Media omitted>
4/29/18, 10:42 AM - Bisvarup: So next day when we are meeting
*Each of the developers has to bring in their working code failing which I shall communicate it to ma'am that that particular developer put in no contribution to the project*
4/29/18, 10:43 AM - Bisvarup: To the implementation of the project"
4/29/18, 10:43 AM - Bisvarup: *
4/29/18, 10:43 AM - Bisvarup: Expect for the portions the person actually did*
4/29/18, 10:43 AM - Barunabha 3: Agei ble6i Working code j hbei seta garranty dite par6i na
4/29/18, 10:44 AM - Bisvarup: Ageo bolechi working code na hole it doesn't count

4/29/18, 10:47 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Please do.
4/29/18, 10:48 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: @918777033152 see then what does it mean "ATLEAST TRY"?
4/29/18, 10:50 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: If you don't give in the effort then  we will have nothing to show.. If you have some lines of code,we can show it still.
4/29/18, 10:50 AM - Bisvarup: Let me clarify what gaurav meant by at least try.

He means spending the whole day or a few days working to understand the concepts and logic. Watching tutorials reading documentation .

In short putting in an honest effort. He means working on it for more than 14 hours a day. If you do that you can produce working code.
4/29/18, 10:50 AM - Barunabha 3: 14 hrs par6i na vai
4/29/18, 10:50 AM - Bisvarup: That's up to you. Working code hole e I am Happy
4/29/18, 10:51 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Try o korbo accepted o hbe na. Then why to do bhai. R @918013069900  NATOK tr theke kchu Sekhar ache bhai. I salute you. Bye. Too much time lost already.

4/29/18, 10:52 AM - Bisvarup: Yup same here would not have to waste so much time if you just did your work.
4/29/18, 10:53 AM - Bisvarup: I as a pm would talk to MA'AM regarding the work put in by the developers.
4/29/18, 10:53 AM - Bisvarup: How much time is spend is up to you. As long as the work gets done.
4/29/18, 10:55 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Bhul korte korte Manush shekhe ,I will talk to mam if u gais do everything you can in your abilities to get the job done. I as a lead Dev desire an honest effort from you guys, and if you can implement atleast one test case you'll develop enough interest to do the rest.
4/29/18, 10:55 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: So try for that one test case first.
4/29/18, 11:13 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Me and Gourav talked just before a sec, he has given me some documentation, i am trying to do so. Hope for the best.
4/29/18, 11:17 AM - Bisvarup: @919433415698 unfortunately @918777033152 made some mistake every developer need to show a module for the code review.
4/29/18, 11:17 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: What mistake.
4/29/18, 11:18 AM - Bisvarup: Every developer needs to show a module for the code review
4/29/18, 11:18 AM - Bisvarup: Documentation is not code
4/29/18, 11:18 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Im saying documentation for preparing.
4/29/18, 11:18 AM - Bisvarup: I don't understand @918777033152
4/29/18, 11:19 AM - Arnab Nandy 2: Gourav give me the documentation that can help me to code
4/29/18, 11:19 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: Exactly.
4/29/18, 11:20 AM - Bisvarup: Oh I see. @919433415698 do note that the documents may not be exhaustive, you may need to do some digging on your  own
4/29/18, 11:20 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: I'm doing the digging myself
4/29/18, 11:20 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: So I'll keep updating him
4/29/18, 11:20 AM - Gaurav Ganguly Iem: As much as possible.

5/2/18, 8:36 AM - Bisvarup: @917980325968 I am not sure about the format in which you have to upload, as it is not clear from madam's mail, and I am not aware of the minute details of the QA, so better you can directly ask madam about it before friday or you may ask your peers.
