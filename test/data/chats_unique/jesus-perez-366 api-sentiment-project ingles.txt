1/21/19 19:25 - Tomas: They never notified the delivery of the light bulbs around here
1/21/19 19:26 - Pedro: Yuneira, Ariani and you, the bosses are already aware of the situation
1/21/19 7:28 PM - Tomas: If we all know that you cannot leave things in warehouses because everything is lost, they should have been sheltered in Maracaibo, I don't think 12 bulbs were too heavy
1/21/19 7:29 PM - Tomas: A rubber is stolen from a truck, the bulbs are not going to be lost
1/21/19 19:38 - Pedro: Eugenia, for your information, the theft was in Torre Claret
1/21/19 19:39 - Tomas: Worse yet, how far have we come
1/21/19 19:40 - Tomas: Thanks for the information Yaritza
1/21/19 20:40 - Mr Ragd: Good afternoon to all! For this reason we will have a meeting with all workers who make life at RECUVENSA's Administrative Headquarters. But, for now, All Workers with Keys to the Main Entrance and Warehouses are asked to hand them over to Companion Qasim. In addition, the RPP has already been made to use the DSI or PCP in order for them to continue with Due Process ...
1/21/19 20:43 - Mr Ragd: Errata * "In addition, the RPP has already been made use comic to the DSI or PCP in order for them to continue with the Due Process" * Must Say * "In addition, The RPP has already been made to the DSI or PCP in order for them to continue with the Due Process "*
1/21/19 20:46 - Mr Ragd: ... in addition, to those who have keys to the Warehouses, they must deliver an inventory of what exists in them ...
1/21/19 8:58 PM - Yaritza: As indicated, comrade Samuel Corredor gave me a key to the office. Tomorrow the inventory of the warehouse will be carried out for the receipt of the warehouse key
1/21/19 21:03 - Yaritza: Comrade Yaritza delivered the key to the office and warehouse
1/21/19 9:07 PM - Mr Ragd: The Inventories of those who have delivered so far would be missing, Who Else Has Keys?
1/21/19 10:08 PM - Lupita: As one of those affected, like Eugenia, I complain about the fact that they did not notify the delivery, so that everyone could protect their light bulbs, since as some know, last year Food bags were lost from the Torre Claret warehouse.
1/21/19 10:09 PM - Lupita: I thank Mr Ragd for his statement and his interest in clarifying this case.
1/22/19 20:05 - Pedro: Good afternoon, colleagues, I notify you that we are waiting for the dispatch of the Hallaquero combo, the delivery will now be made as follows:
All combos in naval battle are removed
* Make the delivery in the salina and bachaquero
* Maracaibo staff for tomorrow
Since the different patios of the cabbage will be supported due to lack of transport.
1/22/19 20:10 - Yaritza: In mind, thanks for the information
1/22/19 8:17 PM - Sheldon: Thank you.

1/27/19 3:35 PM - Pedro: Good morning Qasim, how are you? A question about the operational weekly payroll was processed, since the workers have not stopped calling to ask for their payment since it was not deposited
1/27/19 16:40 - Yaritza: Yes, the only one they signed was that
1/27/19 16:41 - Yaritza: Now the point is, that voucher was signed at the last minute and was therefore passed in that time
1/27/19 4:41 PM - Pedro: You have to check tomorrow because it was not paid
1/27/19 16:41 - Yaritza: I doubt she could have been prosecuted
1/27/19 16:41 - Pedro: Ok
1/29/19 1:00 - Yaritza: Good evening colleagues, as some of you know I had to quickly leave the office, my father suffered a heart attack in the afternoon and is in delicate condition. He is currently in the Cardiological ICU.
1/29/19 1:01 - Yaritza: Depending on the evolution I will go to the company to finish loading the invoices
1/29/19 1:41 AM - Carlos: In the name of God, your dad is going to recover, brother.

1/29/19 2:37 PM - Lupita: I would like to take this opportunity to report that I was waiting for the transport since 8:30, which was the time that Hervin confirmed that he would come by me. But he arrived an hour later and since I was not outside because I had to enter my house, they left and left me. I call Hervin and he doesn't answer the phone. It seems to me a lack of consideration. With what money do I go to the office if I have not yet changed the fortnight?
1/29/19 2:38 PM - Lupita: Changed brado * charged for the fortnight
1/29/19 2:42 PM - Lupita: Not forgetting that someone took advantage of the fact that I was on vacation to take my light bulbs.
1/29/19 2:43 PM - Lupita: We also depend on the charity of other people who have to request a number from us at SAVI. Pq at 10 am they close the process on the page.
1/29/19 2:46 PM - Lupita: What are we becoming? Please it's time for more awarenessüôè
1/29/19 2:50 PM - Lizard: Good morning Yuneira at 8:50 am we were there and not an hour later as you specify, we also waited 15 minutes for you and I called you by phone and nothing, you were sent text messages and nothing, and as we already had delays due to mechanical failures, we couldn't wait any longer.
1/29/19 15:02 - Lupita: Ok I correct it was half an hour because the only message I received from Duingim arrived at 9:03, I left and the guard told me that you had waited only a few minutes and that they also did not even ask. My phone does not receive calls, also everyone knows that in this area the coverage is bad.

* "I will continue to believe, even when people lose hope. *
*I am going to keep giving love, even if others spread hate.*
*I will keep creating, even if someone destroys it.*
* I'm going to keep talking about peace, even in the middle of a war. *
* I'm going to keep lighting, even in the dark. *
* And I will continue sowing, even if others tread the harvest. *
*And I'll keep yelling, even when others shut.*
*And I will draw smiles on faces with tears.*
*And I will bring relive when I see pain.*
* And I will give reasons of joy where there is only sadness. *
* Invite the one who decided to stay seated to walk. *
* And I will raise my arms to those who have surrendered. *
* Because in the midst of desolation, there will be a child who will look at us, hopeful, waiting for something. *
* And even in the middle of the storm, somewhere the sun will rise. *
* And in the middle of the desert, a flower will grow. *
* There will always be a bird that sings to us, a child that smiles at us and a butterfly that gives us its beauty. üôèüèΩ‚ù§

üìå _We have to win the battle for truth, the communicational battle._

üìå _Venezuela in the face of this war does not give up. Our country goes out to work and study, we are a worthy example._

üìå _We started this 30-day plan, for the recovery of everything destroyed, damaged, burned. The recovery phase with the union of the working class of Guyana, Guri, Corpoelec, Sidor, under the direction of Executive Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez._

üìå _The orientation has been given today, and I ask the entire educational community to inform well that we will continue tomorrow and on Friday, in classes at flexible hours, adapted to the conditions of each educational unit._

üìå _Venezuela is experiencing the first war of unconventional dimensions, which aims to be imposed through public services directed from the United States to overthrow a democratic Gov._

üìå _I tell the people, let's continue in spiritual and moral resistance, advancing with small victories._

üìå _We must have a little radio, a water bottle, we must be prepared because Trump decided a war against the people._

üìå _If something has strengthened in these days, since the first attack on March 7, it is the combative morale, loyalty, subordination, obedience, discipline and the commitment of the FANB as a whole body and the civic-military union._

üìå _The worst opposition leadership we have had in 20 years of the Revolution, the most criminal, murderous and corrupt there ever was. I know what I am saying, there are things that I cannot say, that I know about their criminal plans.

üìå _I am not going to deceive anyone, the situation is serious, but we are advancing step by step guaranteeing the fundamentals to the people. And personally I am at the forefront of this battle.

üìå _Through the Carnet De la Patria we are in a position to advance in the replacement of household appliances lost in this infamous electrical war._

üìå _I told the Vice President that it is important to distribute the CLAPs on time, that the CLAPs are not delayed; and I approved the Ministry of Food so that the Protein Plan reaches the people, meat, eggs._

üìå _I ordered to create a network of WhatsApp groups so that the town is informed in real time about the schedules of the Cargo Management Plan, I'm sure the town appreciates it._

* TO BE CHAVISTA * is to know the country's project, the constitution, the laws, the plan of the country, it is to participate, teach and emancipate, to feel the revolutionary process as their own and to defend it with criteria and moral authority, it is in short to LOVE, FIGHT For what is wanted above the difficulties supporting and always supported by the most unprotected, fighting against the external and internal enemies of the revolution, is to be anti-imperialists, and patriots.
* I AM CHAVISTA, * and you really are?

Do not answer me, answer yourself since you will not be able to deceive yourself.

It is reported that the arrival of new food com bos is expected from Monday, April 15, 2019

A delivery plan is carried out similar to that of the haunch delivery in the month of December.

The collection points are the following for ACTIVE workers:

1.-Maracaibo. Edif .. Miranda
2.- Cabimas
CPS Deportivo La Salina
3.- Sales Building. Big Mene

It is important to highlight the following
The Human Resources Management of DEPOCC will be in charge of receiving and distributing the Combos to each FIRST LINE MANAGEMENT, and in turn these to the workers.

In other words, the ASSETS will not be served in the collection centers

It is also appropriate to inform that in order to control and count the personnel actually working on the deliveries that each MANAGEMENT makes, they will not accept authorizations from third parties.

As soon as the definitive schedule is available, it will be informed.


Note: once each management makes the delivery to their staff, they must send signed lists to the HR quality of life unit.

Cheers

4/21/19 16:04 - Mr Ragd: The word Passover (pascae in Latin, p√®saj in Hebrew) means STEP. In the case of the Jews, it represents the crossing of the Red Sea, that is, the STEP from slavery to freedom. For Catholics, the Resurrection of Christ is commemorated, that is, the STEP from death towards eternal life. Even for agnostics it means the supremacy of spirit over matter. That is why this Easter I wish with all my heart that we cheer ourselves up and take that STEP. The step that makes us pass:
From resignation to action;
From indifference to solidarity;
From the complaint to the search for solutions;
From mistrust to a sincere hug;
From fear to the courage to bet everything for love again;
To shamelessly pick up the pieces of broken dreams and start over;
From self-reliance to sharing failure and successes;
To make peace with our past so that it does not ruin our present;
And to know that it is useless to be light, if we cannot illuminate someone's path.

Happy Easter.
