Till drought ended in the land of Israel, Elijah did not suffer or starve for a day, because God used ravens and a widow to feed him. I Prophesy to your life that the Almighty God will feed and satisfy you and your family with all good things. The blood of Jesus will speak deliverance and breakthrough for you and your family. This is your day of mercy and favour in JESUS Name. Amen

8/4/18, 1:09 AM - YTC Emmanuel2: IT IS TIME FOR YABATECH TO BECOME A UNIVERSITY – ALAKIJA
The founder of Rose of Sharon foundation, Dr. (Mrs.) Folorunsho Alakija has declared that the 70th year old institution, Yaba College of Technology (Yabatech), ought to have become University by now.
During the courtesy visit of Yabatech Management to Alakija in her Rose of Sharon Towers Victoria Island recently, she noted that Yabatech is the premier tertiary institutions in Nigeria which has been in existence for a long period; and the College is ripe to become University.
The richest woman in Africa encouraged the Management to surmount whatever the challenges before the College; and put more effort in ensuring that the status of the institution changes as soon as possible.
The Rector of Yabatech, Engr. Obafemi Omokungbe in his opening speech explained that the courtesy visit is to appreciate Mrs. Alakija for her numerous kind gesture to the College; and to familiarize with College’s illustrious fellow to intimate them of our plans.
“We are planning to inaugurate Board of Fellows made up of distinguished Nigerians who are recipients of the College Fellowship award that will be partners in progress; we will tell them our needs and the areas that they can be of help to us individually and collectively. Endowment fund will be launched to take active part for development project especially Epe campus which is begging for infrastructural development.”
Alakija is an illustrious fellow of Yabatech, she is one of the biggest individual donor to the College; her latest gesture was the donation of Skill Acquisition Centre, she has promised to equip the centre with necessary facilities.

8/5/18, 8:48 AM - ‪+234 808 637 2110‬: *Think OutsideTheBox* 

Your boss pays you N30,000 per month.
Now let's assume that you decided to save all without touching a dime, it would take you 36 months to make N1million.

(Did I hear you say 3years?)

 Absolutely!

On the other hand, if you can convince an organisation like Dangote Group to print and supply 5000 umbrellas to them (to be used as souvenirs) and you make just N200 profit per umbrella, in just one day you must have made N1million.

What about becoming a billionaire, that is where it gets crazy!

Now let's increase your pay to N1,000,000 per month and you decide to save all without touching a dime. In a year, you must have saved N12million. It would take about 84years before you can make N1billion. (Please subtract your current age).

On the other hand, Nigeria has a population of about 200 million people, If you can supply salt to just 12million people once in a month and you make just N200 from each person supplied, in one year, you must have made N2.9billion.

This shows that to become rich, you have to stop talking to bosses and start talking to clients.

 *HARD ANALYSIS:* 

Divide your SALARY by 30 days and see what you get (i.e. the number of days in a month and see the funny thing about your salary plan).

For example,
(1) An average level-12 worker in the state government civil service earns NGN 60,000.
**** And this translates to NGN 60,000÷30= NGN 2,000 every day. This is LESS THAN the amount made daily by an AVERAGE HAWKER in the city.

(2) A freshly EMPLOYED GRADUATE BANKER in most NIGERIAN BANKS earns an average of NGN120,000 monthly.
***So everyday, you get NGN120,000÷30= NGN4,000 as the daily value for your work-life. By implication, this is LESS THAN the amount earned DAILY by an AVERAGE DRIVER in d city and in some villages.....

(3) If you are a FRESH GRADUATE EMPLOYEE in some oil companies, you earn an average of NGN300,000 monthly. So in a day your WORK-VALUE is NGN300,000 ÷ 30= NGN10,000
**** This is LESS THAN the daily amount earned by an IRRIGATION FARMER supplying vegetables to Lagos MARKETS, a TIPPER CAR DRIVER supplying sand for three BLOCK INDUSTRIES and CONSTRUCTION SITES just 3 times a day and DRIVERS of DANGOTE TRUCKS who have bought off the trucks at scrap value and vare using them to convey products between villages and the cities for just five business owners.

--------->>>HOPE BY NOW, IT IS SINKING IN, RIGHT?

And when there is an ISSUE in the FAMILY that requires FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, the DRIVERS, HAWKERS and the rest are looking up to you with a WHITE COLLAR JOB.

(4) If you are an NYSC MEMBER, you DON'T need to be told that:
*****NGN19,800÷30 = NGN 660 is your worth on a daily basis.
I hope you know that PURE WATER SELLERS who own a shop, a pepper soup joint and a small TOYOTA COROLLA car to distribute pure water to five restaurants earn MORE THAN you and WHEEL-BARROW PUSHERS working on contract for three warehouses probably make MORE MONEY than you EACH DAY 

............
Wake up and be more productive. We should be more proactive, create room for more income and strive to diversify our streams of income.

The earlier you wake up and smell the coffee, the better for you...... 

Someone right now will say this analysis is too ideal to be true but take your time and do it, you will grasp the crux!!!

STOP waiting for the Government to feed you, feed yourself and help the Government feed others. That is where we are in this age.... 

I wish you an Entrepreneurial mindset......  Think ENTREPRENEUR, THINK PROPERENEUR.
8/5/18, 10:20 AM - YTC Prince Oluwafe: Today Sunday 5th of August been the 1st Sunday of d month l decreed God Grace will announce your greatness. Mercy will usher you to your table of upliftment. Favor will settle you. Your feet will not stumble. God will take you to places of honor. God will watch over your seed. He will  water your seed. You will reap bountiful harvest.

8/10/18, 6:24 PM - YTC Kef: The Management of Yaba College of Technology has developed a new method for the 2018/19 post utme. Immediately you buy your form online, the system automatically calculates and generates your aggregate score based on the o level result you submitted for VERIFICATION and your chosen course of study, so all you have to do is to wait for cut off mark to be released, and merit list as well. This is a new development.
8/10/18, 6:25 PM - YTC Chun Li: So I put Yabatech as my third choice, I want to change it to my second choice

8/14/18, 11:10 AM - YTC Hurdunayo: Good day to everyone here, My name is Toluwani, Wanna share a brief story with us.... 

After graduating from Sec school May 2012, the euphoria of graduation and feeling of freedom was overwhelming, Waec Result was released August and from thence on it has been a hell of a journey. Failing maths and Biology in that exam, there was always an opportunity of a second trial.. 
2013 GCE came, Wrote it after much preparations and study... Results came out and twas Just the same... Math and Bio D7... I was perplexed, questions were being asked... Being one of the best students in the class, I couldn't just wrap my head around it.... Time was moving quickly.
I decided in 2013 that'll prepare Soo hard for 2014 exams so I'll be able to work on my purported weaknesses.... 

September 2014 GCE came.. I was brimming, practically on fire!.. I had spent most of the previous 11months reading like a medical student preparing for MB... Wrote each of the paper and was in a very confident mood... After the exams, I told my parents, this was my time!... And I ain't gonna be denied this time (Take note my parents are the types that NEVER supports Special centre or helping)... 
December 21, 2014... The result came out.. I picked up my phone... Logged on to waec site and checked.... What a wonderful result!!!....Phy-B2, Chem-B2, Eng -B2, Maths- B3......  Biology D7😭😭... The feeling was like a thrust through the heart of a Persian soldier... I felt like twas the end...
Told my parents... In their words.. "Your next decision is up to you".. but always remember "we are solidly behind you" (No malpractice)

2weeks later, I contacted a sec school in my area.. and I was told to register for May/June internal waec 2015, I thought and sighed... Writing waec with my Juniors of 3years.. this is unthinkable... It was hard but I thought of the end game,...
Simultaneously I registered for Jamb 2015.... With awaiting result.. 
Wrote the exam with the same preparations.... Had *220*.. with my  mentality of "above 200" as at that time.. I was satisfied
I knew something greater awaits... I didnt care how it felt...
April Internal WAec came 
The exam came.. wrote it wit the same desire... Knowing it was my Fourth and I wanted it to be my last!... 
After the exam.. I was Soo quiet, not too optimistic.. I was just awaiting the outcome without excessive Euphoria or expectations... 
Immediately after the exam, I started preparing for post utme... I initially picked UNILORIN (biomedical engineering)... I later changed to Unibadan (Medicine)... Cos I heard that UI considers only Post utme scores for Admission (as at 2015).. I started the reading jamboree again... Spending time to study and this time my preparations were soooo intense... I didn't even give in to the thoughts of "What bout your o level result"... 
August 2015 came... I checked the result.... I had everything complete... Bio - B3, Maths- C4....and the rest... But with lots of C's... 
I breathe relief... And focused more on my post Utme.... 
A month to the exam we were told... "no calculator for the UI post utme"... I was strucked.. how could this be?.. I quizzed... It changed the whole complexion of my preparations... 
September 9 came.. that fateful Friday.. I wrote my exam in the human physiology lab.... 90min for 100 questions no calculator.. and in the Physics questions I could see "sin 27°" and some other impossible Calculations without calculator.. I did my best... 5min to go.. I was in no 87... I had to shade from 87-10calculator... Normal sturvs.😂... 
Five days later the result came out... I had 68.... I started quizzing again... Will I get medicine with this.. started worrying... 
Cut off came out... Medicine - 74... 
That was the turning point of my life.. I said to myself "Despite how tough and outrageous the post utme questions were, people still had 74+ and 80+.. I shouldn't be different"... I was given Geology and my dad kicked against it... UI 2015 story ended... 
I headed to Ilaropoly, the polytechnic choice I picked... Wrote their post utme.. sweet English and maths... Had 75... Cut off wasn't released. Buh it was very sure I was gonna be admitted with such score... Not until I heard.. "If you don't pick the poly as your first choice, they'd not consider you despite the score"... I was devastated!... How can this be?!?!... With 75??!!... I was given Nothing!.. a girl with 25 picked em first choice in place of a university and was given the same course (Science lab tech).. I moved on... 
University of medical sciences Ondo state, was inaugurated that year.. 2015... They released their post utme form (10,500 naira).. no one cared.. so far it's to get What I want.. I registered for the exam.. picked Medicine and I was ready for the battle... 
The day came... Over 3000+ students came... We wrote the exam.. and the result was pasted in the school... Someone snapped it and I had 68... I was upbeat, to me, this was the time!... I'd definitely get admitted now... medicine cut off was released and twas 71!... I cried my head out!... 2015 wasted!. Twas painful and heartbreaking... But I never gave up!!

2016 Came.. I had registered for 2016 utme and I came up with the nick "Dr_Tholuwaniey"... My desire increased.. I was ready to die for what I wanted!.. Medicine.. 
The exam was 3months away.. I Read, covered the syllabus back to back and I was Soo prepared... Wrote 2016 exam and I had 287... My parents were optimistic.. I was also optimistic.. 
I started preparing for UI post utme again.. I was determined to prove UI wrong, determined to get what I wanted, 

Then came mallam Adamu Adamu and he cancelled Post utme... and declared "o level screening".. it was disheartening.. I have B's and C's... At this point I started to think, am I cursed?.. or should I be studying at all!... My post utme aggregate score with o level screening was 63.7... UI mandated only those with 65 to even do change of course..  2016 slipping away... Another year ahead.. I didn't cry!... I was even more determined... 

2016 October I heard about OAU pre degree.. I wrote the entrance exam and went for the programme... Throughout the programme my eyes was on the prize... "Medicine".. I made it Soo personal that, when people ask me for the course I'm going for I tell em something else... Deep down.. my vibe never dropped.. I was more determined.. nothing to lose, everything to gain... Jamb 2017 came I wrote and had 275... Lotta peeps blasted 300+, Juxtaposing PD work and Jamb prep together is alot to ask for... I prepared for Jamb with 2weeks... And with that score I was the more determined... 
PD final exam was written and I has 83.1... merely 37th position outta over 800+ BCPites..
This prompted me to register for Post utme... Wrote post utme... (33/40...) Aggregate score - 74.3.... screening score 79.6
I was optimistic and I never stopped believing... 
Medicine merit cut off was out and twas 76... 
Another thought might have come... is it one of those years again?!?!

My aggregate with PD was 74.5
With Post jamb was 74.3 

I was just in a pensive mood believing, this story isn't over!.. praying and believing!

The Catchment cut off came out
Ogun state was 73.9
I beat the Catchment with both aggregates.. I sighed relief... 

January 26th 2018.. the struggle was ended.. a 5year wait!... a 5yr fight, battles were fought... All in the name of exams, seems the luck was Ill... But in the end Perseverance is the leading stone to success... I was given medicine!.. at last!

My main purpose of writing this life's epistle is for those that weren't Admitted due to one issue or the other.. never lose your belief, I practically know how it feels... Never feel less bout yourself.. keep working, keep believing, explore every opportunity!... This you've experienced is just one of your life stories, it will pass and when you finally WIN, you'd forget the struggle... Don't be pressured into making scary decisions... Always believe in yourself.. nothing in life is impossible!.. keep working, keep on!... Definitely you'd get it!... Whatever the course.. you're up for it!. This is just a training season.. a trying period.. 
The harvest will come... Don't give up!!!

8/16/18, 7:11 PM - YTC Khinde: PLEASE, I NEED YOUR ADVICE PLEASE. 
I CHOOSE OAU AS MY FIRST CHOICE AND FUOYE AS SECOND CHOICE AND FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC ADO EKITI AS THIRD CHOICE. I HAVE OBTAINED AND FILLED OAU AND FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC ADO EKITI POST-UTME SCREENING FORM. I DID NOT PICK YABATECH AT ALL IN JAMB BUT I HAVE OBTAINED AND FILLED THEIR POST-UTME SCREENING FORM WHICH I SCORES 53 TO STUDY QUANTITY SURVEYING. OAU POST-UTME EXAM IS COMING UP 1ST TO 7TH OF SEPTEMBER. 
I AM CONFUSED, WHILE WAITING TO WRITE OAU EXAM IN SEPTEMBER, SHOULD I OBTAIN CHANGE OF INSTITUTION NOW AND CHOOSE YABATECH AS SECOND CHOICE OR I SHOULD WAIT AFTER 7TH OF SEPTEMBER WHEN OAU RESULTS MUST HAVE BEEN OUT TO CHOOSE YABATECH FIRST? 


PLEASE, WHAT SHOULD I DO PLEASE?

W A R N I N G PLEASE READ
IT......It's too long to read but
it
is important for us to know
that ....what the
BIBLE says is happening
now..... Satan fulfills his
promise!" LORD SAVE US!
Rapture will take place any
time from now. Everything
hindering the rapture has
been
removed. Gospel has been
preached almost
everywhere. All the
prophecies have been
fulfilled. Angels physically
seen and captured
on camera @ Dansoman also
gives a 'sign'. The devil is
working very hard to occupy
Christians with the things of
this world so
that the day will catch them
unawares.
Please be prepared. There is
no more time,
Use the advantage of this
free sms to send
this message to at least all ur
contacts. Do not ignore. This
is also a source of
evangelism. Souls are dying.
GOD bless you!Let’s Pray
Hard: 6 6 6 The Mark of The
Beast Prophesy
Finally Fulfilled… as Written
By: Jonathan
Annobil. The US Senate has
passed the Obama
Health Bill into law. The
implementation would
commence soon. This bill
would require all Americans
to be implanted with a
Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) chip in
order to access medical care.
The device will
be implanted on the forehead
or on the arm.
This is to fulfill the prophesy
in the Book of Revelation 13:
15-18 concerning the MARK
OF THE BEAST. Are you still
doubting the END
TIME? Do U know that the
special car which
was made for Obama is
known as the BEAST?
Get READY. The rapture is
near! Revelations
13 is being played out right
before us. Many are still
unaware. Why is the chip
being implanted exactly
where the Bible says it
would be? Why on the hand
and forehead.
Why not anywhere else? Why
is it being
connected to your bank
account? Remember
the Bible says you won't be
able to buy or sell without
the mark 6 6 6. And guess
what! The chip is connected
to your financial details.
What breaks my heart the
most is that many
people in the Church will not
make it if JESUS
comes now? Many are
unaware that the end
is near. Don’t tell me that it's
advancement in technology
or development. If any area of
your life is not in sync with
GOD’s word,
repent and be converted. If
you miss heaven
you can never miss hell…..
think about it. Hell
is not a pretty place. The
worst part is that it
is for eternity… He who has
ears, let him hear what the
Spirit says to the church.
Please rather than post and
forward
senseless messages. Send
this one to
everyone you know. Do the
work of an
Evangelist. PLEASE SHARE
THIS MESSAGE WITH
ALL YOUR CONTACTS. Have
you ever wondered what
should have happened if we
treat the Holy Bible the way
we treat our
mobile phone? And we really
can’t live
without it. Only 7% percent
will re-send this
message. Don’t be of the
93% who will not
share the message. Satan
said. “I wonder how humans
claim to LOVE GOD and
disobey HIM, and claim they
hate me yet they obey
me” Do not send later. Share
and send now.
May Almighty GOD grant
success to everyone
who reads and sends this
message.
Tomorrow may be too late.
Stay blessed.

THIS INFORMATION IS COMING FROM A RELIABLE ISLAMIC SOURCE FROM TURKEY THAT PLEADED ANONYMOUS.

A TERRIBLE WAR IS COMING INTO NIGERIA. A GROUP OF ISLAM ARE COMING INTO NIGERIA WITH THEIR WEAPONS TO ATTACK THE NIGERIANS MOST ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANS.
MANY LIVES WILL  BE WASTED WITHIN FEW DAYS AND THIS BATTLE WILL START FROM NORTH INCLUDING ABUJA CITY.
NIGERIANS.... THIS IS THE END OF DEMOCRACY AND END OF NIGERIA,BLOOD WILL FLOW LIKE WATER. NOT FINISHED, THESE ISLAMIC GROUPS THAT ARE COMING WILL ENTER NIGERIA THROUGH SHIPS,  BOATS (RIVERS) AND DEPARTS WITH THE HELP OF ISLAMIC STATES AND ISLAMIC LEADERS THAT SPONSORED THEM.
THE PURPOSE OF THEM COMING WITH WAR IS TO ESTABLISHED ISLAMIC NATION IN NIGERIA BEFORE THE TOTAL BREAKUP OF  NIGERIA.
THE ONLY REASON THEY WANT TO COME NOW IS BECAUSE A BIG REFERENDUM IS COMING INTO NIGERIA VERY SOON AND IF THAT HAPPENS, THEY WILL GREATLY LOSE.
PLEASE PRAY FOR  NORTHERN CHRISTIANS, MIDDLE BELT AND ESPECIALLY IGBO LAND, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TARGET, THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS  CALLED ON THEIR CITIZENS TO MOVE OUT OF NIGERIA WITHOUT ANY DELAY, THE USA GOVERNMENT HAS WITHDRAWED THEIR CITIZENS AND SHUT DOWN THEIR EMBASSIES IN ABUJA.  CHRISTIANS ARE ABOUT TO BE WIPED  OUT IN NIGERIA.
