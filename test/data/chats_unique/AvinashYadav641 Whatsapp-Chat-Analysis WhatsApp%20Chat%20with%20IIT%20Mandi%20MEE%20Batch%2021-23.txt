8/10/21, 17:07 - Vivek: We have submitted 4 out of 5 core courses and one technical communication course. So, total 5 courses have been selected which amounts to 13 credits.
8/10/21, 17:08 - Vivek: And we have certain doubts regarding discipline electives and outside discipline electives , which we have to ask from Ma'am
8/10/21, 17:17 - Arpit Kshirsagar: I told mam regarding slot clashing she told that you have to ask that course instructor to shift or have to mail OAS regarding this.

8/10/21, 19:05 - Arpit Kshirsagar: is anyone able to register for more than 13 credits in OAS?
8/10/21, 19:07 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Yes
8/10/21, 19:07 - Yogesh Deshmukh: I just added German-I as free elective
8/10/21, 19:08 - Arpit Kshirsagar: Great üëç
8/10/21, 19:09 - Prunendu Gain: How many course  can we select
8/10/21, 19:10 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Right now, any number of courses could be selected, but some would need to be dropped later
8/10/21, 19:10 - Prunendu Gain: Ok
8/10/21, 19:11 - Prunendu Gain: Like in btech we used to study 6 subs per semester
8/10/21, 19:11 - Prunendu Gain: But here i am getting confused
8/10/21, 19:13 - Yogesh Deshmukh: 1. You are required to opt for 4 compulsory (core) courses.
2. Out of 6 available disciplinary elective courses, 1 must be chosen.
3. Out of several available free, electives, one must be chosen.
8/10/21, 19:13 - Prunendu Gain: So sum will be 6 right
8/10/21, 19:14 - Yogesh Deshmukh: You can select more than one courses as electives (both disciplinary and interdisciplinary) but will have to keep only one which is your favourite and eventually drop all others from the same category.
8/10/21, 19:14 - Avinash Yadav: Maximum number of credits can be taken in this semester any idea
8/10/21, 19:14 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Exactly
8/10/21, 19:14 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Plus technical communication
8/10/21, 19:14 - Prunendu Gain: That is extra
8/10/21, 19:15 - Yogesh Deshmukh: But compulsory

8/22/21, 20:22 - Faisal Khan IIT MANDI: Can we take core course as P/F or just the electives?
8/22/21, 20:23 - Suhas: I am also not sure about that but I think they'll not let us take core course as P/F
8/22/21, 20:23 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Just electives not core ones
8/22/21, 20:23 - Faisal Khan IIT MANDI: Achaa
8/22/21, 20:24 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Yeah
8/22/21, 20:24 - Yogesh Deshmukh: We'll have to fill an Excel sheet
8/22/21, 20:25 - Suhas: Yes
8/22/21, 20:25 - Faisal Khan IIT MANDI: Yeah... It's written that CR has to give it to FA
8/22/21, 20:26 - Faisal Khan IIT MANDI: In our case..... I guess we have to give p/f to vivek bhai
8/22/21, 20:27 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Okay should we just type our roll number and course name, course code?
8/22/21, 20:27 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Would be impossible to have excel sheet circulating for everyone entering their intended purpose p/f course
8/22/21, 20:28 - Suhas: I guess typing our Roll no, course code and name would be good idea.
8/22/21, 20:29 - Faisal Khan IIT MANDI: Yes
8/22/21, 20:29 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Definitely
8/22/21, 20:30 - Avinash Yadav: Ok then we will send him immediately

8/22/21, 20:30 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Right
8/22/21, 20:33 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Otherwise Google spreadsheet would be a good option
8/22/21, 20:53 - Prunendu Gain: So my courses are approved
8/22/21, 20:53 - Vivek: Google spreadsheet is a good idea btw
8/22/21, 20:53 - Prunendu Gain: And the sum became 19 credits
8/22/21, 20:53 - Prunendu Gain: What is pass fail course
8/22/21, 20:54 - Prunendu Gain: 5 core , 1 dept elective, and one 1free elective?
8/22/21, 20:55 - Prunendu Gain: Do explain please
8/22/21, 20:55 - Arpit Kshirsagar: it comes to 19 credits
8/22/21, 20:55 - Prunendu Gain: Yeah bro
8/22/21, 20:56 - Arpit Kshirsagar: only 1 P/F course we can take in the entire Mtech program.
8/22/21, 20:56 - Prunendu Gain: <Media omitted>
8/22/21, 20:56 - Arpit Kshirsagar: 19 + 3(P/F) course = 22 credits
8/22/21, 20:57 - Prunendu Gain: Is it compulsory bro
8/22/21, 20:57 - Prunendu Gain: ?
8/22/21, 20:57 - Arpit Kshirsagar: Yes, its compulsory.
and you can take it in this sem or next sem.
8/22/21, 20:57 - Prunendu Gain: Ok bro
8/22/21, 20:58 - Yogesh Deshmukh: I also have the same doubt
8/22/21, 20:58 - Prunendu Gain: Ok bro
8/22/21, 20:58 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Is should pass fail course be 7th course (apart from basic 19 credits) or it can be one of them
8/22/21, 20:58 - Arpit Kshirsagar: if u want you can take P/F course now 
or 
take it in next semester.
8/22/21, 20:59 - Arpit Kshirsagar: P/F course is extra 3 credits, apart from 19 credits.
8/22/21, 21:00 - Arpit Kshirsagar: Basically 
those who are taking 22 credits this semester, that includes 1 P/F course(3 credits)
8/22/21, 21:00 - Yogesh Deshmukh: That's great
8/22/21, 21:00 - Yogesh Deshmukh: That's what I'm doing
8/22/21, 21:01 - Arpit Kshirsagar: Even i had the same doubt, Suhas cleared mine.
8/22/21, 21:01 - Arpit Kshirsagar: are u taking p/f this sem ?
8/22/21, 21:01 - Prunendu Gain: So from whre we can choose p/f course
8/22/21, 21:01 - Prunendu Gain: From free elective?
8/22/21, 21:02 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Yes
8/22/21, 21:03 - Prunendu Gain: How many courses we have to take in the next semester including core, dept elective, free elective
8/22/21, 21:04 - Suhas: Bro courses number doesn't matter I guess. Credits matter
8/22/21, 21:04 - Prunendu Gain: In the current semester i think the total courses will be 8
8/22/21, 21:04 - Prunendu Gain: Yes bro
8/22/21, 21:05 - Suhas: Next sem lab subjects are more all are 4 credit Courses
8/22/21, 21:11 - Arpit Kshirsagar: How many of you guys are taking P/F course this sem?
8/22/21, 21:14 - Suhas: Me bro
8/22/21, 21:14 - Arpit Kshirsagar: because you all have to fill google spreadsheet and pass it to FA.
8/22/21, 21:15 - Suhas: Yes
8/22/21, 21:16 - Suhas: I think tomorrow by 12 we'll finish with the spreadsheet and later CR can pass it to FA ma'am
8/22/21, 21:16 - Vivek: Yes, That would be okay
8/22/21, 21:17 - Yogesh Deshmukh: We'll also get those doubts cleared by that time
8/22/21, 21:17 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Because there are plenty of them
8/22/21, 21:17 - Vivek: So, basically those students who have  total 22 credits in this semester can choose any one of their courses as a P/F course except the core courses. Right?
8/22/21, 21:18 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Not sure
8/22/21, 21:18 - Vivek: Okay then, we'll ask ma'am about it with more detail
8/22/21, 21:18 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Right
8/22/21, 21:24 - Suhas: I think to save time, one of us can ask all of our doubts.
8/22/21, 21:25 - Yogesh Deshmukh: Good idea
8/22/21, 21:28 - Suhas: Last time she seemed a bit upset üòÖ

8/23/21, 10:35 - Faisal Khan IIT MANDI: Ok

11/13/21, 06:52 - Deepak Kumar Shah: The Robotronics Club is back with another event for you - Build-A-Bot 2021. While we are always eager to work hands-on, one of the most crucial steps before fabricating a project is to implement and simulate it on software to test and optimize the various circuitry and code involved. Build-A-Bot aims to bring to you such an experience, where you will work with a team of 3 to 5 members and realize your projects both on simulation software and hands-on. Here's the¬†rulebook (shorturl.at/cegDR)¬†for more details¬†on the event. Important links¬†and registration form can be found in the rulebook too.

We are also happy to announce that we will be hosting a workshop by experts from MathWorks to elaborate¬†more on designing a project to its deployment using MATLAB and Simulink. To collect more information on how the workshop would benefit all of you, we have created this¬†form: https://forms.gle/tGzLxkBpxSEConKs5. Please fill it out so that the workshop can be optimized for your benefit.

We are looking forward to participation in huge numbers from you! Feel free to reach out to any of the club volunteers for any other queries you may have.

Thanks
The Robotronics Club, IIT Mandi

2/18/22, 13:00 - Suhas: Surelyü§£
2/18/22, 13:08 - Vivek: friends, 
As we all know that sudhir sir's lab class is clashing with that of Modelling and Simulations lab class on Monday. So If we want to have both the courses then anyhow we'll have to convince the professor of Modelling and Simulations to shift the lab class from Monday to any other day. 
Or we can choose any other dept. Elective. But for our post graduate project and thesis, we need to learn this course. So it'd be better if we convince Talha sir.and We can convince him by mailing individually and if our whole class will mail him then only he"ll listen to our issue.
2/18/22, 13:41 - Suhas: Yes bro
2/20/22, 20:15 - Neha Khokher: Kal koi class hai kya??
