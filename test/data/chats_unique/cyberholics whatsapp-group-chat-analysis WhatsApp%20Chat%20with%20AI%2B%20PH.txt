06/06/2022, 9:09 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Good evening Guys.. 🙌🏻🙌🏻
06/06/2022, 9:09 pm - +234 905 508 2080: I am trying to understand the difference between Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing 🤔.... Who can help 🥲🥲
06/06/2022, 9:18 pm - Cyberholics: In my own understanding, Feature engineering consists of the creation of features for modelling and analysis, whereas preprocessing involves cleaning the data and preparing the raw data in a way that enables a data scientist to start creating features.
Data preprocessing is usually about data engineers or scientists getting large amount of data from the sources e.g databases,  data lakes, etc and preparing them for feature engineering. Which includes basic cleaning, and joining different sets of raw data.
06/06/2022, 9:26 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Feature engineering we are either creating and or manipulating features

Eg
 *Manipulating features* 
Converting seconds to minutes or minutes to hours

 *Creating new features*
We can create a new features by adding subtracting dividing or multiplying two columns or more columns (features) to form one.
Df['X']=Df['A']+['B']



Creating a new features from existing features
06/06/2022, 9:28 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Data preprocessing involving manipulating or dropping of unwanted data b4 building machine learning model
06/06/2022, 9:28 pm - +234 703 839 7866: We also have Data wrangling also
06/06/2022, 9:31 pm - +234 905 508 2080: This means data preprocessing is a subset of Feature Engineering but feature Engineering is not data preprocessing...... Thanks Prof @2349069268453  👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🙂
06/06/2022, 9:36 pm - +234 905 508 2080: ❤️
06/06/2022, 9:45 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🤔🤔...What's the difference between LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder????
06/06/2022, 10:03 pm - +234 703 839 7866: OneHotEncoding we are converting categorical data into a form the Machine Learning algorithm can understand and use to build models
06/06/2022, 10:03 pm - +234 703 839 7866: LabelEncoding we are assigning Numbers to categorical variables
06/06/2022, 10:26 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🤔 I don't get this????
06/06/2022, 10:37 pm - +234 814 041 4172: It's basically converting alphabets to numbers. The machine understands these numbers and can use them to build models
06/06/2022, 10:45 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🥲I know,but the two of them are doing the same thing.. 🤔What differentiate them???
06/06/2022, 10:48 pm - Cyberholics: First, you need to understand the concept of encoding, which is converting a categorical variable to a numerical variable since the ml model can only understand the numbers and not the text. 
Now in one-hot encoding, the categorical variables are converted to dummy variables which are 1 and 0. Then the label encoder converts the categorical variables to specific integers alphabetically.
06/06/2022, 10:48 pm - +234 703 839 7866: OneHotEncoding is in binary that is 1 and 0
06/06/2022, 10:49 pm - +234 703 839 7866: LabelEncoding can be more than 0 and 1
06/06/2022, 10:53 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 😅😅😅😅👍🏽👍🏽We are there....... Cracked versions
06/06/2022, 10:57 pm - Cyberholics: For example, we have a column of dog breed which we want to convert to numerical features, one hot encoding creates extra columns and assigns 1 or 0 for a particular dog breed in a new column. But the label encoder  assigns different integers to a particular dog breed and doesn't create a new column i.e dog breed A can be 1, dog breed B can be 2 and dog breed C can be 3 e.t.c 
Hope you grab the concept
06/06/2022, 10:59 pm - +234 905 508 2080: ❤️🎊🎊🎊🎊😅
06/06/2022, 11:00 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Accuracy score is 0.1 bro thanks 👍🏽

07/06/2022, 12:13 am - +234 813 419 0172: 💯
07/06/2022, 2:22 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🤔🤔🤔Guys, I believe smhw we know what Corr() is used for, but what about Cov()? Who can help 🙏🏽🙏🏽
07/06/2022, 2:27 pm - Lukman Idris: That I for covariance
07/06/2022, 2:28 pm - Lukman Idris: Covariance is the measure of  variability of two random variables
07/06/2022, 2:31 pm - +234 905 508 2080: What about the corr()?
07/06/2022, 2:43 pm - Lukman Idris: Correlation
07/06/2022, 2:54 pm - +234 905 508 2080: I don't get it bro...okay what makes them different, I think correlation is still about variability
07/06/2022, 2:55 pm - Lukman Idris: Correlation is just the extent to which two variables are linearly related
07/06/2022, 2:56 pm - Lukman Idris: I.e they change together at a constant rate
07/06/2022, 3:14 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Can you sum up your explanation please ...i feel we are getting there... I Still don't get it
07/06/2022, 3:23 pm - Lukman Idris: In a layman term, correlation is the relationship existing between two phenomenon
07/06/2022, 3:24 pm - Lukman Idris: In other words, a change in one phenomenon results in a change in the other
07/06/2022, 3:33 pm - Mr Abimbola: Your correlation must involve two variables where one is dependent and the other is independent.
07/06/2022, 3:34 pm - Mr Abimbola: For instance; a pair of shoes will depend on the sizes available
07/06/2022, 3:40 pm - Lukman Idris: Not necessarily
07/06/2022, 3:41 pm - Lukman Idris: It only measures linear relationship
07/06/2022, 3:55 pm - +234 905 508 2080: You are right bro.. My teacher 😅😅🙏🏽.
07/06/2022, 3:57 pm - Lukman Idris: Your boy loyal sir
07/06/2022, 4:02 pm - Mr Abimbola: Which equation is y(x)=a+bx+error time
07/06/2022, 4:06 pm - +234 813 294 1110 joined using this group's invite link
07/06/2022, 4:06 pm - Lukman Idris: Linear regression
07/06/2022, 4:09 pm - Mr Abimbola: I reserve my comment
07/06/2022, 4:10 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Both of them determine the relationship between two variables, positive and negative but the difference between the two is that in *cov()* the +ve and -ve  values doesn't have any degree range, the values could be, -1, 3, - 0.1, 0.2 etc while *corr()* has a degree range between -1 and 1, which explains well how the change in one will effect the Change in another...
07/06/2022, 4:12 pm - Lukman Idris: Remember, correlation is not causal. It only looks for relationship
07/06/2022, 4:12 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 😅😅... We need your comment so that we can preprocess it
07/06/2022, 4:13 pm - Mr Abimbola: I'm not disputing the fact that
07/06/2022, 4:13 pm - Lukman Idris: Okay boss
07/06/2022, 4:15 pm - Mr Abimbola: It shows the relationship between two things
07/06/2022, 4:16 pm - Mr Abimbola: You still need two variables before it can be correlated
07/06/2022, 4:27 pm - Lukman Idris: Very true,  but they don't need to depend on the other
07/06/2022, 4:28 pm - Lukman Idris: One doesnt need to depend on the other
07/06/2022, 4:28 pm - +234 905 508 2080: correlation helps us determine the degree of relationship between two or 
more variables. This is important, A high degree of 
correlation does not always necessarily mean a relationship of cause and effect exists 
between variables.
07/06/2022, 4:36 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 📌How do we differentiate Bias and Variance?  or are they the same?   🤔Any idea.... ...
07/06/2022, 4:41 pm - Mr Abimbola: Yeah accepted
07/06/2022, 4:47 pm - +234 703 839 7866: I just came online
07/06/2022, 4:49 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Sir this is correlation coefficient..
There is a difference btw correlation and Coefficient...

All these concept are more statistics than Data science
07/06/2022, 4:49 pm - +234 703 839 7866: But data science extends statistics
07/06/2022, 4:50 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Correlation coefficient is what measures the degree of relationship between variables
07/06/2022, 4:51 pm - +234 703 839 7866: The most common used correlation coefficient is the Pearson correlation coefficient ― also known as Pearson's r
07/06/2022, 4:52 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Correlation checks for relationship

While
Correlation coefficient check the degree of the relationship.
07/06/2022, 4:53 pm - Lukman Idris: Exactly
07/06/2022, 5:01 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 😂😂... @2347038397866  welcome
07/06/2022, 5:02 pm - +234 905 508 2080: What about this👆🏽
07/06/2022, 5:20 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Variance tell us how spread our observation is
07/06/2022, 5:21 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Bias is the difference between the  prediction of our model and the actual value
07/06/2022, 5:46 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🤔Break it down bro
07/06/2022, 5:47 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🤔🤔🤔 I need more clarity on this, when can we say that a Model has a Variance or Bias?
07/06/2022, 6:03 pm - +234 703 839 7866: The difference between the actual value and model prediction is bias 

Eg

If u model predict 5 but the actual value is 7

The bias will be 7-5 = 2
07/06/2022, 6:04 pm - +234 703 839 7866: To get the variance of a variable we use the scatter plot..
Sometimes outliers can cause high variance
07/06/2022, 6:47 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 🤔😅.... This your answer requires validation o .. Abeg  DSN ph people please let's validate this 🙏🏽
07/06/2022, 7:09 pm - +234 813 294 1110: Good evening all. Well this is true, but not entirely. The bias and variance actually both contribute to the prediction error. And also the irreducible error  caused by the noise in  the data.

We could further use this arrangement to get the attention of the founders and execs of those companies by the time we begin to make noise about it on social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn

I’m working on this dataset and I’m tired already.
Please guys, how do I fix the bug🥺🙏🏾
19/06/2022, 10:39 am - +234 905 508 2080: 🥲🥲Don't give up... You are having ValueError, kindly understand the problem you are trying to solve very and the type of model you have selected. Also make sure training and testing dataset are homogeneous.. Especially when it comes to preprocessing and your feature engineering.. Check the shape of your testing, ytrain, Xtrain datasets to know how homogeneous they are.
19/06/2022, 12:11 pm - Cyberholics: maybe your "y_test" contain more than 2 variable, check your "y_test" to confirm if it has more than two variables,
if "y_test" is like [0, 0, 1, 0, 1 ] it should work , but if it likes [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2] or even [0, 5, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 3, …..], it will cause the error of multi_class must be in ('ovo', 'ovr')
19/06/2022, 12:12 pm - +234 814 257 8404: Okay… I’ll do that.

Thank you
19/06/2022, 12:21 pm - Cyberholics: And as for the value error, i am trying to figure it out aswell, i have gotten that kind of error when i tried to convert a dataframe to a CSV file, i will share the solution as soon as  i remember it.
19/06/2022, 12:28 pm - Cyberholics: I think the error is probably from the prediction dataframe, it cant fit into the "sample submission" column of the sample dataframe
19/06/2022, 12:40 pm - Cyberholics: <Media omitted>
19/06/2022, 12:43 pm - Cyberholics: converting it to a dataframe :
 prediction=pd.DataFrame(prediction,columns=["column name in sample submission"]).
19/06/2022, 12:58 pm - Cyberholics: Now run your code to export the prediction to CSV file

This is how i solved mine, i hope it works for you 😊, i would be waiting for your feedback

22/06/2022, 3:24 pm - +234 813 338 8311: Good day everyone,I’m trying to convert the date column from integer to normal date format.

I’ll appreciate your suggestions and feedback on how to go about it
22/06/2022, 3:27 pm - Lukman Idris: Have you tried 
df['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['DATE'], format='%Y%m%d')
22/06/2022, 3:27 pm - +234 813 338 8311: I have o
22/06/2022, 3:29 pm - Lukman Idris: What did it display?
22/06/2022, 3:32 pm - Lukman Idris: I will send an article that explains the problem and solution..
22/06/2022, 3:33 pm - Lukman Idris: https://towardsdatascience.com/10-tricks-for-converting-numbers-and-strings-to-datetime-in-pandas-82a4645fc23d
22/06/2022, 4:16 pm - +234 703 839 7866: This date format is thesame with Microsoft excel serial date format..

I get this kind of format alot when working with Microsoft Excel
22/06/2022, 4:16 pm - +234 703 839 7866: There is a python library call *xldate*.
U can use Xldate to convert this to normal date format.
22/06/2022, 4:17 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Here is an article about it
Check I out

22/06/2022, 4:35 pm - +234 903 992 6837: Check if there's a null value, or invalid data format in the date column
22/06/2022, 4:35 pm - +234 903 992 6837: These could sometimes hinder pandas from processing a column completely
22/06/2022, 4:43 pm - +234 813 338 8311: There’s no null
22/06/2022, 5:20 pm - +234 903 992 6837: Okay, if it isn't private, please share a link to your work so I can take a look at it

22/06/2022, 11:13 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: Good evening Mr Gospel,

How can one be part of the available groups.. 

Thanks a million sir
22/06/2022, 11:14 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: This problem can be tackled using EXCEL power Query or from Excel home tab
22/06/2022, 11:14 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: Using the short date icon should be able to do it
22/06/2022, 11:15 pm - +234 903 992 6837: Yeah... Very easy in excel😄.
22/06/2022, 11:16 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: Yes Boss,

EXCEL is amazing too... with our python tool
22/06/2022, 11:18 pm - +234 903 992 6837: Yeah boss...
Combining plenty tools makes you a superman🦸‍♂️
22/06/2022, 11:27 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: I once had an issue of having numerical data stored as integers_ tried working my way round it in python ( met gridlock)

Only to revert to Excel_ and the problem was a piece meal for that tool...


One should not underrate and discard EXCEL because python is a high level  programming language and data crunching tool...

May we all excel!
22/06/2022, 11:28 pm - +234 903 992 6837: Hahaha...
Well, sometimes, using excel won't work.
22/06/2022, 11:33 pm - +234 903 992 6837: I was working with about 100k rows of data...
And needed to process some corrupted column...

I tried using excel, but...it worsened the whole thing.

When using excel, you should first consider:
1- the amount of data you are working with.
2- Your System processing capacity (RAM and processors)


But, these limitations can be bypassed when using python (Large dataset).

For system specifications, I use cloud-based platforms...e.g Google Collab .

This is just my own observation. 

Someone else can help emphasize on this.
22/06/2022, 11:34 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: True Boss
22/06/2022, 11:35 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: Just that,

With Excel power Query or the one embedded in power Bi _ large data can also be processed though not up to the capacity of python
22/06/2022, 11:36 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: Python can handle large data sets_ be they big data or whatever
22/06/2022, 11:37 pm - Adeyeye Seyi: But connecting with your power pivot or power Query engines gives one capacity to work with large data than normal Excel home ribbon

@2349069268453 I am confused pls correct me

Part one


Team Google answered 3 questions failed 1 But got a bonus question correct..

 *Team Google* 
2 x 3points = 6 + 1 point for bonus answered = 7


Team Microsoft answered 3 questions and fail none.

 *Team Microsoft* 

3 x 3points = 9



@ the end of part one 

Team Google 7points
Team Microsoft 9points


Part two 

Team Google answered 3 questions and fail none with an extra bonus.

3 x 3points = 9+1bonus = 10

Team Microsoft answered 3 questions and fail 1

2 x 3points = 6

End of part 2

Team Google 10points
Team Microsoft 6points

Total for team Google

7+10 =17points

Total for Team Microsoft
9 + 6 =15 points
09/07/2022, 10:02 pm - Cyberholics: Does the recording say the same?? How many did team tesla answer for the second part? (I honestly don't know)I still understand how i answered the last question
09/07/2022, 10:09 pm - +234 703 839 7866: This was my personal record as the test was going on
09/07/2022, 10:19 pm - Cyberholics: I am not trying to say your personal record is not correct, what i trying to say is that the moderator recording is not correct, that's misleading you know, secondly i find errors in some questions  and that's misleading as well, i don't know if i am the only one noticing it
09/07/2022, 11:03 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Yes..

I recall the first quiz two weeks ago there were two errors that did not favor my team. But it was an *Error* 

The moderators are humans, I recall Mr Gospel after the first quiz acknowledged that there were error and promised to improve as time goes on.

The moderators are really trying @2349055082080, @2347062822019 and the rest.

Although winning is to spicy it up it is not really about winning, it is about improving our AI skills and knowledge.

And @2349069268453 ur are very good.

How are you doing?

So, I know I'm in team Tesla. The community head was the one who told me that.

But, I don't know if we have a sub-group or a medium where my teammates connect with one another.
11/07/2022, 8:40 am - +234 905 508 2080: This will be treated and solved. 😑😑
11/07/2022, 8:41 am - +234 903 992 6837: Alright, thanks

This is an *all expense paid ML cohort* and will take 4 months to complete.
A few things to note:
1. Google is *not training* you *if you're not ready for a job.* 
2. You will attempt a series of *Python & ML tests* before screening.
3. You are ready to *commit 4 months* to active learning.
4. You will be taking more than *3 Professional exams* after the cohort ( *all paid by Google* ).
5. You will be *offered a role in ML* which will require you to *leave* your current job if it happens.

21/07/2022, 8:03 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Python-open-CV with Karas for image classification..
21/07/2022, 8:05 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Awesome @2347038397866 , 🥲Kindly give us a brief overview of this project  and the % completion value🙏🏽
21/07/2022, 8:20 pm - +234 708 093 4619: Well I was working on opencv for a face detection program
21/07/2022, 8:26 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Great one. 👍🏽.. Also kindly let us know the % completion value and a brief overview of the project.
21/07/2022, 8:41 pm - +234 703 839 7866: Okay.. well Mr Gospel I just started but I am facing some small challenge 

Let me give a brief run down 👇

A machine learning algorithm that can detect the type of product sold in an Ecommerce website.

E.g 

The machine learning algorithm should be able to detect if a product in the Ecommerce website is a T-shirt, bag, Shoe, mobile phone or even laptop.

Using an Ecommerce website like Jumia or Konga as example the Machine Learning algorithm should be able to tell if a certain product is a T_shirt,a shoe, a phone or a bag

But what I will be training the model to detect will be  shoe, T-shirt, Mobile phone and TV set.


To build this model I need  *Beautiful soup* (A python library for web scraping)

 *Python-openCV* 

 *Karas* and *Tensorflow* 

Numpy , pandas and matplotlip of course

 *The Three challenges I am facing* 

Python Open_cv is not a machine learning library but it has an API for building machine learning algorithm.. (I am currently researching and understanding it).

I understand how to work with python's *beautiful* *soup* *library* very well but I still need the Selenium Library to web scrap some website..

I don't understand *selenium* very well but I am on it right now..


Lastly the main Wahala 

Just like tensorflow Python-open-CV require a very good system (system with GPU) to work fine.. my system doesn't have a GPU so it takes time to train a model something 10-30min.. I can't work with Google Colab because of the poor network in my area..

Build something like this requires patience.

I think today's quiz was really engaging and showed a sign of preparedness.

If you all could remember ☹️☹️
23/07/2022, 9:18 pm - +234 810 164 4685: Yes.
Pandas is arguably the most used python library for data preparation.

25/07/2022, 4:28 pm - +234 905 508 2080: 📌📌Do we still have *Python Novice* here🤔..?   If you are having issues with Python basics relative to Data Science Kindly let us know now.. We about to🚀 🚀😐😐
25/07/2022, 4:53 pm - Micheal Ph: Afternoon Everyone. Just wanted to ask, how do you get the current time for the day and not have it in a string format but in time (24hrs)? That's assuming u want to subtract a future time from the present time.
25/07/2022, 5:11 pm - +234 905 508 2080: Have you tried int(time)?
25/07/2022, 5:37 pm - +234 905 508 2080: import datetime
time=datetime.now()
int(time.strftime("%H%M%S"))
25/07/2022, 5:58 pm - +234 905 508 2080: <Media omitted>
25/07/2022, 6:25 pm - Micheal Ph: So then I'd have to convert the other time to integer before doing my subtraction and then converting back to time. Which then I don't know if the time will be accurate. But then, I'll try that. Thanks
25/07/2022, 7:04 pm - +234 905 508 2080: It depends on where you are applying it, you can define a function for the conversion, you can even use only the "%H"  for hrs since the rest are fractions
