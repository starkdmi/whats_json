12/09/2020, 10:23 pm - +91 83559 84667: I think this will work

12/09/2020, 10:43 pm - +91 88020 40148: Sorry u miseed np.where()
12/09/2020, 10:44 pm - +91 77278 58500: Nope, check the second line
12/09/2020, 10:44 pm - +91 88020 40148: Hmm yeah but we can write in same line
12/09/2020, 10:45 pm - +91 77278 58500: Sure.
12/09/2020, 10:48 pm - +91 88020 40148: Guys today it was my first session and I have not gone through  first 4 lectures yet... I know basics of python .... Shall I complete last 4 lectures...? Or can I continue with next lectures....?
12/09/2020, 10:49 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Completing the last 3 classes would help a lot
12/09/2020, 10:49 pm - +91 98858 15897: If you’re new to pandas I would recommend to start from previous lectures as you need to understand what is dataframe series and why we use pandas and few functions and how to read different files
12/09/2020, 10:50 pm - +91 99537 20991: You will still get to learn new things
12/09/2020, 10:50 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Sudhanshu’s approach is very close to real-time activities
12/09/2020, 10:50 pm - +91 99907 96993: There is no harm, u may skip the intro lectures
12/09/2020, 10:51 pm - +91 98858 15897: If you could spend extra time go through the python classes as well. They were amazing. Very clear and crisp
12/09/2020, 10:51 pm - +91 88020 40148: I know lil bit of pandas and numpy... But still I will try to finish it with a week as u guys suggested.... Thank u
12/09/2020, 10:51 pm - +91 99907 96993: But 3rd and 4th u shud cover

12/09/2020, 10:53 pm - +91 98858 15897: Any idea on how many people are there in our Aug 29th batch? Last time when I asked Darius before the start of our batch he said like 2000 people. Just wanted to confirm that number.
12/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: I don’t think 2000 is right
12/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +91 89680 55931: If v have two conditions so we need to use np.where two times?
12/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Could be a typo
12/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +91 89680 55931: No yr

12/09/2020, 10:55 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: iNeuron site claims to have 1400+ students
12/09/2020, 10:57 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Will be more glad if it’s true 😊
The more Data Scientists, the better
12/09/2020, 10:58 pm - +91 98858 15897: It’s always good to have a community where we can interact. It not only helps to share our knowledge and doubts but it also creates motivation to complete it. Glad the group was created. Let’s keep this as active as possible atleast till we complete and course😁
12/09/2020, 10:58 pm - +91 99537 20991: You can use & in between no need to write np.where two times
12/09/2020, 10:58 pm - +91 99537 20991: True 👌
12/09/2020, 10:59 pm - +91 93707 88208: 😄

12/09/2020, 10:59 pm - +91 85069 38506: But i think it doesnt matter. Matter is our growth on this learning path.
12/09/2020, 10:59 pm - +91 99537 20991: So are you all working ??
12/09/2020, 10:59 pm - +91 70218 21421: No 3rd year IT
12/09/2020, 11:00 pm - +91 98858 15897: I’m working and wanted to switch my career to data science
12/09/2020, 11:00 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Agree!
But I think it would matter at a point where we need their bandwidth
12/09/2020, 11:01 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: But more guys around is always better to keep ourself motivated
12/09/2020, 11:01 pm - +91 98858 15897: Yes! That’s the reason why i asked so that we can move to a bigger platform but let’s see so far we can accommodate 126 more people if more are willing to join we can think about it then.
12/09/2020, 11:02 pm - +91 98858 15897: True

12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: 1.I have use df instead of titanic_train
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: Actually the way sir is using the code is generally first he is subsetting the whole dataset with the help of fare with minimum value and age with minimum value in first question and then storing in a variable and then selecting the name and age with that subset data
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: Guys
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: So if you want to know what subset is
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: Then use this code for first and second on your laptop
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: df[['name','age']][(df['age']==min(df['age']))&(df['fare']==min(df['fare']))]
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: and for 2.use this
12/09/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 79923 78732: df[['name','age']][(df['age']>30)&(df['fare']==min(df['fare']))]
12/09/2020, 11:24 pm - +91 79923 78732: Actually the way sir is using the code is generally first he is subsetting the whole dataset with the help of fare with minimum value and age with minimum value in first question and then storing in a variable and then selecting the name and age with that subset data

12/09/2020, 11:24 pm - +91 79923 78732: Then use this code for first and second on your laptop
12/09/2020, 11:24 pm - +91 98858 15897: Guys more than trying to understand the code itself look at the structure itself. Think in a way what are dataframes,series and what type of return type iloc takes as an input. If you understand these basics it will be very helpful to solve complex manipulations
12/09/2020, 11:24 pm - +91 79923 78732: 1.I have use df instead of titanic_train
12/09/2020, 11:25 pm - +91 79923 78732: df[['name','age']][(df['age']==min(df['age']))&(df['fare']==min(df['fare']))]
12/09/2020, 11:26 pm - +91 79923 78732: and for 2.use this
12/09/2020, 11:26 pm - +91 79923 78732: df[['name','age']][(df['age']>30)&(df['fare']==min(df['fare']))]
12/09/2020, 11:26 pm - +91 79923 78732: Guys use this I have design for the two question surely u will get the answer try once
12/09/2020, 11:28 pm - +91 98858 15897: @917992378732 what is df[[‘name’, ‘age’]] is for? We are anyway doing the logical operation by filtering them after this right?
12/09/2020, 11:35 pm - +91 79923 78732: Actually Nishant I have stored the data as df instead of titanic_train that sir have used and this means that see we have to find those names and age of the persons for whom the age and fare is minimum right so if we will use this command and do filtration also then you it will work as first we will get a dataframe with the filtration using age with minimum value and fare with minimum value and at last we have to select name and age from the filtered value so instead of storing it in a variable and then selecting
12/09/2020, 11:36 pm - +91 79923 78732: Just use the filtration and selection both means during filteration just select the name and age column by passing it with df
12/09/2020, 11:37 pm - +91 79923 78732: In this way you could convert the two lines of code into one line
12/09/2020, 11:37 pm - +91 98858 15897: Okay let me try this
12/09/2020, 11:37 pm - +91 79923 78732: Yeh try this code and another also
12/09/2020, 11:41 pm - +91 98858 15897: Okay done👍🏻
12/09/2020, 11:41 pm - +91 79923 78732: It is working
12/09/2020, 11:43 pm - +91 79923 78732: Now use the concept of exploration i.e. now suppose u wanna find some statistics or insights with subset then just write the whole code and after that use the data exploration functions like count,mean,sum etc with dot operator and three things will be done in one line
12/09/2020, 11:43 pm - +91 79923 78732: Like this see
12/09/2020, 11:43 pm - +91 79923 78732: df[['name','age']][(df['age']==min(df['age']))&(df['fare']==min(df['fare']))].mean()
12/09/2020, 11:45 pm - +91 79923 78732: Now here we will see that after filtration and selection here you will get the error as name is categorical data so instead of mean use count and you will get the total count of values for name and age column

13/09/2020, 1:11 am - +91 70139 04382: why
13/09/2020, 1:11 am - +91 99907 96993: zip returns a tuple
13/09/2020, 1:12 am - +91 86109 02042: zip only make pair according to index
13/09/2020, 1:12 am - +91 99907 96993: d2 has nothing to pair with f:50, so it will omit the value

13/09/2020, 4:47 pm - +91 80775 83648: 15
13/09/2020, 4:48 pm - +91 70184 19197: When you apply pass statement then no operation occurs
13/09/2020, 4:48 pm - +91 70184 19197: Sorry for my bad english.

13/09/2020, 4:48 pm - +91 98265 36683: txt is declared inside for loop not outside the for loop
13/09/2020, 4:49 pm - +91 79790 46449: Here
13/09/2020, 4:49 pm - +91 98265 36683: So this will throw an erroe
13/09/2020, 4:49 pm - +91 80775 83648: No
13/09/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 80775 83648: We are printing txt outside for loop
13/09/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 98265 36683: But txt is declared inside for loop
13/09/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 70184 19197: Oh I missed it
13/09/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 98265 36683: 4) none of the above
13/09/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 80775 83648: Indentation k bahar print kra rhe bro
13/09/2020, 4:51 pm - +91 98265 36683: 🤦🏻‍♂️
13/09/2020, 4:51 pm - +91 79790 46449: Its surely gives option 1
13/09/2020, 4:52 pm - +91 70184 19197: Just execute it and you will know what will happen
13/09/2020, 4:52 pm - +91 80775 83648: It will print 15
13/09/2020, 4:52 pm - +91 74040 77008: 15
13/09/2020, 4:53 pm - +91 98999 04060: Correct Guys.
13/09/2020, 4:53 pm - +91 79790 46449: Yes ri8
13/09/2020, 4:53 pm - +91 98999 04060: The answer will be 15. Option C.
13/09/2020, 4:53 pm - +91 80775 83648: Yup
13/09/2020, 4:54 pm - +91 70184 19197: So I am right🤔 but how
13/09/2020, 4:54 pm - +91 80775 83648: Pass will do nothing and txt keep on holding updated value from list and outside loop it will print recent(last) value ie 15
13/09/2020, 4:54 pm - +91 79790 46449: When for loop exexuted last its hold the last element

13/09/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 99442 80682: Yes bro..  If I remove it,  I'm getting 15.
13/09/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 99442 80682: But..  This code returns me 11,12..
13/09/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 80775 83648: This should through an error as txt will not be defined in that case
13/09/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 99442 80682: May be illogical..  But there should be some meaning right
13/09/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 99442 80682: As it doesn't throw any error
13/09/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 80775 83648: You must've used txt as list somewhere in the same notebook that's why it's printing that list

13/09/2020, 5:10 pm - +91 80775 83648: This will through error bro for sure

13/09/2020, 5:10 pm - +91 80775 83648: Check the notebook you must have declared TXT somewhere
13/09/2020, 5:10 pm - +91 98265 36683: No it's the same
13/09/2020, 5:10 pm - +91 80775 83648: Except comments that doesn't make any sense

13/09/2020, 5:34 pm - +91 83559 84667: what is the significance of the statement :-  %matplotlib inline ?? Can anyone help me with this...
13/09/2020, 5:36 pm - +91 99442 80682: Yes bro..  I have defined 'txt' and already deleted it. When I execute again there was no error.  Later I changed the editor and tried..  Then only I realized the error.  Thanks.
13/09/2020, 5:38 pm - +91 86109 02042: It is used only in jupyter notebook
13/09/2020, 5:38 pm - +91 74040 77008: Yup
13/09/2020, 5:38 pm - +91 86109 02042: Some system wont print the plot in the jupyter notebook for that tha command will help us
13/09/2020, 5:40 pm - +91 83559 84667: ok thanks!

13/09/2020, 9:58 pm - +91 77278 58500: Have you*
13/09/2020, 10:00 pm - +91 99537 20991: Yes
13/09/2020, 10:01 pm - Nasik Sami: good to see everyone talking in English and thanks to the one who made this group. I'm from Bangladesh and doing my undergrad in Malaysia in CS.  Let's help each other and learn together!
13/09/2020, 10:03 pm - +91 83559 84667: Yes a little..
13/09/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 77278 58500: Okay. So basically,  if you include the following code it will run matplotlib in 'inline' when in an IPython environment.
13/09/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 83559 84667: Yeah, got it👍
13/09/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 77278 58500: Inline graphics won't be interactive
13/09/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 89680 55931: Yes
13/09/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 77278 58500: Graph*

13/09/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 99537 20991: Try working on spyder it's good
13/09/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 99537 20991: You don't need to use inline and all
13/09/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 83559 84667: Thanks for sharing this!
13/09/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 83559 84667: Actually I am bit comfortable with jupyter notebook than spyder😅
13/09/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 77278 58500: I haven't used it, but even with the matplot library?
13/09/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 99537 20991: Spyder has similar console to R programming so if you are planning to learn R as well this might help

13/09/2020, 10:13 pm - +91 83559 84667: Don't know much about R programming...I have just started python some days ago😅...
13/09/2020, 10:13 pm - +91 99537 20991: For structural data R has better representation of data
13/09/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 83559 84667: Ohh
13/09/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 99537 20991: I mean it will be a plus point in interview if you know python and R both
13/09/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 99537 20991: Many of them are into python only
13/09/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 99537 20991: R is simple just like python simple english
13/09/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 99537 20991: You can try if you want
13/09/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 77278 58500: Does the chart open as a pop-up?
13/09/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 99537 20991: Yes and you can change in setting wheter you need pop up or inline in it
13/09/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 99537 20991: In settings there is view option
13/09/2020, 10:16 pm - +91 83559 84667: Ok if possible after python I will try👍
13/09/2020, 10:17 pm - +91 99537 20991: Sure
13/09/2020, 10:17 pm - +91 89680 55931: 👍👍
13/09/2020, 10:17 pm - +91 99537 20991: Also in Spyder we have different consoles for code, output, graphs, help and dataset display 
Which is much convenient than jupyter as for me
13/09/2020, 10:17 pm - +91 77278 58500: I see
13/09/2020, 10:18 pm - +91 99537 20991: On the same screen I am able to see

13/09/2020, 10:19 pm - +91 77278 58500: Is it the IPython console below?
13/09/2020, 10:20 pm - +91 99537 20991: Too left is the coding screen and below it is the output console
13/09/2020, 10:20 pm - +91 99537 20991: Top right is where we can see our dataframes, variables that are created along with plots and history
13/09/2020, 10:22 pm - +91 77278 58500: Yup, that is IPython environment I guess
13/09/2020, 10:23 pm - +91 77278 58500: Cuz u can do the scripting above
13/09/2020, 10:39 pm - +91 79923 78732: I have worked with matplot on line,bar,scatterplots and histogram and seaborn also like pairplot,violin plot,count plot and heat map but there are much more even in that particular package which I also don't know

14/09/2020, 12:05 am - +91 99537 20991: So the problem is
14/09/2020, 12:06 am - +91 99537 20991: I have a data which updates on daily basis and there are around 800-900 persons data
14/09/2020, 12:06 am - +91 99537 20991: Each person visits a store may be visits same store multiple times in a day
14/09/2020, 12:06 am - +91 99537 20991: And this repeats daily
14/09/2020, 12:07 am - +91 99537 20991: I want to find unique values for the stores visit on daily basis and if the store is visited yesterday it should not be included
14/09/2020, 12:08 am - +91 95665 50398: Do we have any table desc?
14/09/2020, 12:08 am - +91 99537 20991: A column name store we have
14/09/2020, 12:08 am - +91 99537 20991: Data set is same
14/09/2020, 12:08 am - +91 99537 20991: With same column names
14/09/2020, 12:09 am - +91 99537 20991: And this is live data which gets updated on daily basis
14/09/2020, 12:10 am - +91 95665 50398: So there is store field having all store details
14/09/2020, 12:10 am - +91 99537 20991: Yes
14/09/2020, 12:10 am - +91 95665 50398: We need unique person details

14/09/2020, 12:21 am - +91 79923 78732: Bro I have a conclusion for this since you have some columns like no of persons or persons visit like this in your dataset so just randomly sort the whole dataset on the basis of that particular variable and then find the mean as an average and on the basis of mean divide the whole dataset so in one dataframe you will contain value more than mean and another dataframe you will contain the value less than mean and in both dataframes just find the unique values in the store column you will get an idea try this may this work

But we can still watch pre-recorded videos in the dashboard and try practise problems as well and submit assignments, which will help us catch up with an ongoing schedule. We can ask about community class videos in next doubt clearance session😀

By default all the files will be under master branch. We can also create new branch and we can checkout switch between different branches
17/09/2020, 8:52 pm - +91 88876 24847: Upload all assignment in single repo
17/09/2020, 8:58 pm - +91 70218 21421: Same repo
17/09/2020, 8:58 pm - +91 70218 21421: As per your choice

17/09/2020, 9:18 pm - +91 88890 29990: There is a easy way to do it
17/09/2020, 9:18 pm - +91 86109 02042: You have to write a program to fill tha na values in increasing value
17/09/2020, 9:18 pm - +91 88890 29990: Using np.arange
17/09/2020, 9:19 pm - +91 88890 29990: It will be easy and efficient
17/09/2020, 9:19 pm - +91 93590 45066: this is method is not working untill i run this code
17/09/2020, 9:19 pm - +91 93590 45066: df['FlightNumber'][df.From_To=='MAdrid_miLAN']=10055
17/09/2020, 9:19 pm - +91 93590 45066: of I'll try
17/09/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 75981 60996: Please try do in dynamic way
17/09/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 93590 45066: I'm new to this ... what is dynamic way😅😅
17/09/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 99907 96993: i ran a loop on the column and checked if the value was null, if yes then added 10 to previous value and reassigned the value
17/09/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75981 60996: What if there is 1000 na values in data set
17/09/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75981 60996: We cannot write for every time
17/09/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75981 60996: Try to use for loop
17/09/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 93590 45066: yes
17/09/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 88890 29990: But we can also use np.arange for the same
17/09/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 99907 96993: yes this seems to be more efficient than running a loop
17/09/2020, 9:26 pm - +91 75981 60996: Will you share your code
17/09/2020, 9:26 pm - +91 88890 29990: Yeah sure just a min

17/09/2020, 9:30 pm - +91 79923 78732: Man I have found a solution for the problem just this
17/09/2020, 9:45 pm - +91 98821 90185: Seperate python basics,ml notebooks,ml projects would look good
17/09/2020, 9:47 pm - +27 82 349 2667: There is an easy method

17/09/2020, 10:01 pm - +91 79923 78732: See this code I have done found a solution of your problem open in chrome it is containing code
17/09/2020, 10:01 pm - +91 70218 21421: This is the correct way..
17/09/2020, 10:02 pm - +91 70218 21421: As you should always think about the solution which can be applied even if there are many nas
17/09/2020, 10:03 pm - +91 70218 21421: Nice
17/09/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 99907 96993: i don't think this is what he wanted
17/09/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 99907 96993: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 79923 78732: Okay actually from genre I thought about the generation means in 90's generation how many total movies released and then we have to make a list of those movies and just give it a new column
17/09/2020, 10:13 pm - +91 79923 78732: I know you have merged the both datasets but how this genre column contain forte data means animation comedy how could we do this
17/09/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 89680 55931: One thing the code which sir shared there is link of data file or any separate link are also
17/09/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 89680 55931: There
17/09/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 6364 597 569: What is the method ur using
17/09/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 99907 96993: import pandas as pd



df_m=pd.read_csv('/content/movies.csv',encoding='latin1')
df_g=pd.read_csv('/content/Genere.csv',encoding='latin1',header=None)

df_m_temp=df_m.iloc[:,4:]
df_m_temp

d={}
for i in range(len(df_m)):
  l=[]

  for j in range(len(df_m_temp.columns)):
    if df_m_temp.iloc[i,j]==1:
      l.append(df_g.iloc[j,0])
      
  d[i]=l



df_genere_list=pd.DataFrame(d.items(),columns=['Index','Genere'])

df_m['Genere']=df_genere_list['Genere']

df_m.drop('c20',axis=1)
print(df_m)
17/09/2020, 10:21 pm - +91 95860 27824: U can use df['FlightNumber'] = df['FlightNumber'].interpolate()
17/09/2020, 10:24 pm - +91 75981 60996: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 10:26 pm - +91 79923 78732: You can use this                   X=int(input()) df.loc[1:2,['FlightNumber']]=df.loc[1:2,['FlightNumber']].fillna(10045.0+X)
17/09/2020, 10:31 pm - +91 79923 78732: Simple and easy
17/09/2020, 10:42 pm - +91 90365 26141: Wow great method is used.. Simple to use. But didn't understand how this interpolate works on this column.
17/09/2020, 10:44 pm - +91 99907 96993: Can u show the output of this?
17/09/2020, 10:44 pm - +91 96893 49300: not recommended.....It has its own drawbacks
17/09/2020, 10:45 pm - +91 96893 49300: Personal view
17/09/2020, 10:50 pm - +91 90365 26141: May be, but still, I would like to know how it works so that we can apply in other places where it is usefull.
17/09/2020, 10:52 pm - +91 96893 49300: Usme 2 types hote hai backward fill aur forward fill
17/09/2020, 10:53 pm - +91 88890 29990: Please elaborate
17/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +91 96893 49300: Let's suppose agar axis=1 hai ...agar ffill ho.....To nan value ke pahile jo value hai wo nan ke replace me aa jata hai.....
17/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +91 96893 49300: Agar backward fill hai to.....Age ka value ata hai
17/09/2020, 10:54 pm - +91 96893 49300: Same for axis 0
17/09/2020, 10:57 pm - +91 88890 29990: Ok got it
17/09/2020, 10:57 pm - +91 88890 29990: Thanks
17/09/2020, 11:00 pm - +91 96039 33605: its working thanks for the explanation
17/09/2020, 11:04 pm - +91 96893 49300: Work to hota hai bro....Lekin recommend nahi hai use karna...Let's suppose ek column me 4 5 6 7 th value nan hai.......To agar axis=1 use karke interpolate kiya to  tumne 3rd value 4 th ko  aayega....badme 5th ko same value ....6th ko same....7 ko same...To 3rd value  5 bar repeat hoga.....Its degrades the data...Isliye not recommended bolte hai.....Smaller set ke liye accha hai....values fill karne ke liye
17/09/2020, 11:04 pm - +91 95860 27824: Interpolate has many methods. Default method is linear , assume that all values are equally spaced.
17/09/2020, 11:06 pm - +91 96893 49300: Yes
17/09/2020, 11:06 pm - +91 77278 58500: I think data needs cleaning first

I'm urging you to take care of yourself and your elders. Avoid stepping out of your home as much as possible. 
1. Include ginger, lemon, jeera, clove, cinnamon in your diet as much possible
2. Avoid everything that causes you cold n cough 
3. Exercise breathing twice a day
4. Don't rest your body for a long time.
5. If possible, arrange a kit and do a swab test once in 10 days
6. Social distance need not mention
7. Avoid long screen-time. Give yourself 6-8 hours rest
We are 250+ in this group, I thought to acknowledge you and not simply underestimate the ongoing situation.

20/09/2020, 3:23 am - +91 98205 01619: They have better performance than normal bagging algorithm as they they learn from the previous estimators and build model.

Also performance of Boasting algorithm are 8 - 10 times faster

20/09/2020, 10:42 am - +91 99537 20991: Hello guys
I was trying to convert a dataframe to list by following code
20/09/2020, 10:43 am - +91 98205 01619: Code ?
20/09/2020, 10:43 am - +91 99537 20991: <Media omitted>
20/09/2020, 10:43 am - +91 99537 20991: <Media omitted>
20/09/2020, 10:43 am - +91 99537 20991: I am able to see the desired output
20/09/2020, 10:43 am - +91 99537 20991: But this loop is not exiting
20/09/2020, 10:44 am - +91 98205 01619: Looks to be correct. You will get that many nos of list corresponding to the nos of records in our dataframe.
20/09/2020, 10:45 am - +91 99537 20991: Yes I am getting that
20/09/2020, 10:45 am - +91 99537 20991: But this loop is not exiting
20/09/2020, 10:45 am - +91 98205 01619: You can use following.

df.values.tolist()
20/09/2020, 10:46 am - +91 99537 20991: I had NA values which I converted to 0 in my dataset and I am excluding that
20/09/2020, 10:46 am - +91 99537 20991: While creating list
20/09/2020, 10:46 am - +91 98205 01619: Use above code your task of converting df to list will be over
20/09/2020, 10:47 am - +91 99537 20991: Then I cannot convert remove my NA values
20/09/2020, 10:47 am - +91 99537 20991: Isnull or fillna doesn't work with list
20/09/2020, 10:48 am - +91 98205 01619: Simple.

df.fillna(values = 0, inplace = True)

df.values.tolist()
20/09/2020, 10:49 am - +91 99537 20991: I don't want these 0 in my list
20/09/2020, 10:49 am - +91 99537 20991: That's why I had condition while appending
20/09/2020, 10:49 am - +91 98205 01619: Don't want then drop
20/09/2020, 10:50 am - +91 99537 20991: But is there any issue with the code I am running
20/09/2020, 10:51 am - +91 98205 01619: What is the length of df ?
20/09/2020, 10:51 am - +91 73966 05717: If you have more null values in that specific feature, then just remove them and no need to replace them with 0 or -9999.
20/09/2020, 10:52 am - +91 99537 20991: Columns are 6 and number of rows are 5.5 lakhs
20/09/2020, 10:52 am - +91 98205 01619: Oh
20/09/2020, 10:52 am - +91 73966 05717: len([df]) is a 2 D right!
20/09/2020, 10:52 am - +91 98205 01619: If more records it will take time and time complexity of your loop may be bad
20/09/2020, 10:53 am - +91 98205 01619: Go for lambda /apply / map
20/09/2020, 10:53 am - +91 98205 01619: Or as @917396605717  suggested if you don't wnat 0 fill with large extreme values
20/09/2020, 10:53 am - +91 99537 20991: This message was deleted
20/09/2020, 10:54 am - +91 99537 20991: All values are in string format
20/09/2020, 10:54 am - +91 73966 05717: If strings then use one hot encoding technique
20/09/2020, 10:55 am - +91 99537 20991: Have you worked on association rules??
20/09/2020, 10:55 am - +91 98205 01619: OHE will increase the dimensions so better go for Frequency encoding.

But before that tell me what is the business requirement or end result
20/09/2020, 10:56 am - +91 98205 01619: I have done market basket analysis I will share with you in a while
20/09/2020, 10:56 am - +91 99537 20991: I am working on association rules and I have a data set for transaction
20/09/2020, 10:56 am - +91 73966 05717: We can do this also but correct what's the problem statement?
20/09/2020, 10:56 am - +91 98205 01619: BTW are you doing from Machine Learning A- Z by Kirill Ermenko ?
20/09/2020, 10:56 am - +91 99537 20991: <Media omitted>
20/09/2020, 10:57 am - +91 99537 20991: This is my csv file
20/09/2020, 10:57 am - +91 99537 20991: And for working into apriori algo I need to convert this into a list of elements
20/09/2020, 10:57 am - +91 99537 20991: Excluding nan values
20/09/2020, 10:57 am - +91 99537 20991: That's why I was converting them to 0 and excluding
20/09/2020, 10:58 am - +91 99537 20991: Output will be like this
20/09/2020, 10:58 am - +91 73966 05717: Drop Na function will be there in Pandas right! Use that once
20/09/2020, 10:59 am - +91 99537 20991: Ok will try
20/09/2020, 11:00 am - +91 73966 05717: Itseems like F column has more null values
20/09/2020, 11:00 am - +91 99537 20991: Yes
20/09/2020, 11:01 am - +91 73966 05717: Drop that column then
20/09/2020, 11:02 am - +91 73966 05717: If it is important feature then replace with value and use it in future. More null values lead to wrong predictions :(
20/09/2020, 11:02 am - +91 99537 20991: Yea they do that's why in association rules we don't work with Nan values for these kind of data sets
20/09/2020, 11:03 am - +91 99537 20991: Thanks for the suggestions will try with drop na
20/09/2020, 11:04 am - +91 73966 05717: Tq
20/09/2020, 12:46 pm - +91 99537 20991: Thanks buddy it's working and old code is also working I just need to take sample of the data instead of all for such a large data set
20/09/2020, 12:46 pm - +91 99537 20991: I forgot to apply inferential stats

20/09/2020, 1:18 pm - +91 98205 01619: Sorry to disturb at this odd hr.

I just had a question that if we have 3 classifiers (XGboost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and we have predicted on test_data and have pred1/2/3. Now instead of mean if we want weigth mean how to go about it ?

Or

How to assign weights to this predictors ?
20/09/2020, 1:19 pm - +91 98205 01619: Has anyone tried above ensemble technique ?
20/09/2020, 1:19 pm - +91 93484 29088: You could use bagging classifier
20/09/2020, 1:20 pm - +91 98205 01619: VotingClassfier gave bad AUC-ROC so went with averaging
20/09/2020, 1:22 pm - +91 98205 01619: If you need dataset you can check below dataset of my friend for house prices in 5 metropolitan cities and appreciate work on kaagle.

1.1 Write a Python Program(with class concepts) to find the area of the triangle using the below
formula.
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
Function to take the length of the sides of triangle from user should be defined in the parent
class and function to calculate the area should be defined in subclass.

20/09/2020, 8:59 pm - +91 88265 99252: Nothing array and matrix Boths are same 
Simple def:- Matrix is basically group of array or single array in this  [ ].
Array :- 1 dimension
Matrix :- multidimension
20/09/2020, 9:00 pm - +91 90995 37028: ohk, Got it, 😀👍🏻
20/09/2020, 9:02 pm - +91 70184 19197: Array can also be multidimensional
20/09/2020, 9:02 pm - +91 70184 19197: ?
20/09/2020, 9:04 pm - +91 88265 99252: Yes
20/09/2020, 9:05 pm - +91 70184 19197: And matrices are strictly 2 - dimensional
20/09/2020, 9:06 pm - +91 70184 19197: That is why it it subset of array
20/09/2020, 9:06 pm - +91 88265 99252: Array and matrix Boths are same!!!
In short:- 
Array parent 
Matrix child
20/09/2020, 9:07 pm - +91 88265 99252: Okay thanks 
I'll try to remember this
20/09/2020, 9:08 pm - +91 90995 37028: 👍🏻got it, 
thanks
20/09/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 90995 37028: array and asarray are also same???

20/09/2020, 10:05 pm - +91 88265 99252: 3 or more - dimensional matrix  known as array of matrices.
Only in numpy it's strictly - 2D.
For eg:- when we convert colourful image for training then it's convert in 3 dimensional matrix
Where each channel (r,g,b) is a Matrix
20/09/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 98394 23547: 3 or more - dimensional matrix  known as  tensor

20/09/2020, 10:22 pm - +91 98858 15897: The thing is if the data has got more dimensions and we want to predict something from many dimensions from it we opt for tensors which is what deep learning is used for.

22/09/2020, 12:38 pm - +91 98205 01619: Start with viewing the approaches and each day pick up an algo and see teh kernel
22/09/2020, 12:39 pm - +91 98205 01619: and if any hackathons come up by ineuron.ai or AV do participate. Dont rush for being at top just for learning purpose

22/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 83848 05339: To master in a few, you need to be a jack of all. 
So, instead of focusing on mastering, try your hands in all the algorithms because you never know what algorithms you might need. 
You got a 5 month course and a handful of resources, read, understand, and apply all in all possible places. 
Your interviewer won't look for a number of projects, he'll look at the experience you had with the task. Even if it's 1 project, you need to have a deep understanding of what you did and why you did.
22/09/2020, 2:43 pm - +91 83848 05339: Better than focusing on bullets of algorithms, group them by there application. 
Club all the Regression separately, classification separately, then further on, Optimization, Tuning, Clustering.. 

Understand ML AI as a tool to solve a problem instead of making yourself just aware of number of algorithms
22/09/2020, 2:44 pm - +91 83848 05339: And try having a habit of research paper once you get all of these. That will make you stand-out
22/09/2020, 2:44 pm - +91 83848 05339: habit of reading a research-paper*
22/09/2020, 2:45 pm - +91 98205 01619: You forgot to include CatBoost and LightGBM they are used most in hackathon these algo will not win you compitition. BASE ALGO OS DECIDING tree
22/09/2020, 2:45 pm - +91 98205 01619: IS*
22/09/2020, 2:46 pm - +91 98205 01619: You should master Decision Tree and then go for Bagging Nad Boosting type of algos
22/09/2020, 2:46 pm - +91 90283 51722: Thanks for your insight.

22/09/2020, 3:13 pm - +91 98821 90185: One hands on project explanation is enough
22/09/2020, 3:15 pm - +91 77606 81865: They are right actually , i have given 2 interview for internship they only asked question related to core concepts
22/09/2020, 3:16 pm - +91 90283 51722: Yes. While explaining one project anyways 2-3 algorithms come into picture like why you chose this over the other and comparison between similar algorithms.
22/09/2020, 3:18 pm - +91 90283 51722: Is statistics also included?
22/09/2020, 3:18 pm - +91 90283 51722: Like actual formula and all.
22/09/2020, 3:20 pm - +91 77606 81865: they might ask you question in form like explain correlation and how to do we use in our ML models.
22/09/2020, 3:21 pm - +91 90283 51722: Ok. Thanks.

Good work guys! 
Hoping to receive and learn from you all.
23/09/2020, 6:19 pm - +91 93484 29088: Nice one but try to add something new ,that would be great
23/09/2020, 8:06 pm - +91 78932 17618: In python i understand all concepts but when it comes coding i am managing small  things ,how to be good at writing logics
23/09/2020, 8:06 pm - +91 78932 17618: Guve me some suggestions to improve my coding skills
23/09/2020, 8:07 pm - +91 78932 17618: Give*
23/09/2020, 8:14 pm - +91 98205 01619: Keep on practising
23/09/2020, 8:14 pm - +91 73966 05717: Take a big coding problem like gaming related and solve for a month or on your own. Later compare your thought process and search for syntax in Google(it's okay),but concentrate on logic.
23/09/2020, 8:15 pm - +91 73966 05717: No matter which domain you're in, your thought process matters a lot 🙂
23/09/2020, 8:33 pm - +91 88265 99252: Daily try to solve problem 
take ur time and think about logic 
Start from 0 means cheat, check solutions then increase ur level day by day!
If u want to learn and practice follow infytq learning online and do assignment.

23/09/2020, 11:45 pm - +91 88265 99252: 3 month's i completed
Time for just data replacement it take 15min in a day
23/09/2020, 11:45 pm - +91 88265 99252: But part time i created a face recogniser model for their upcoming app
23/09/2020, 11:46 pm - +91 70086 24290: Wow just 15 min per day
23/09/2020, 11:46 pm - +91 70086 24290: Grt 👍

Where i extract embedding features of face and stored in database server!
For training i used random forest classifer but i create a class where i give options whatever u want Neural network
Svm, u can use
23/09/2020, 11:52 pm - +91 88265 99252: For training purpose of model

24/09/2020, 12:11 am - +91 83559 84667: Is there any question set for datasets given for practice in Pandas? Like I m trying beer.txt practice problem but only dataset is given and not the questions...
24/09/2020, 12:21 am - +91 91372 62517: Well appreciate your feedback man! I could had, but as the title states Zero to Hero will take time and eventually all concepts would be put up too. 
By the way even Sudhanshu also mentioned right in last lecture to write blog of something worthwhile so that even non-technical DS can also understand,so kept that in mind.

24/09/2020, 12:31 am - +91 94278 46144: I suggest you analyze the dataset and create questions   by yourself that would enhance your analytical skill which would help you while analyzing new real world datasets

25/09/2020, 1:16 am - +91 70305 91513: Yea
25/09/2020, 1:17 am - +91 98690 24625: Yes
25/09/2020, 1:17 am - +91 77606 81865: I mean i get his anger , i have  heard the same question being asked more than 5 or 6 times , i would be iritated too
25/09/2020, 1:17 am - +91 70218 21421: So everyone should maintain discipline
25/09/2020, 1:17 am - +91 90283 51722: I have seen so many Krish’s videos. Even though people ask him silly questions in chat he remains calm
25/09/2020, 1:17 am - +91 80775 83648: Exactly
25/09/2020, 1:17 am - +91 70218 21421: Yes
25/09/2020, 1:18 am - +91 98205 01619: I can understand people should also do research
25/09/2020, 1:18 am - +91 77606 81865: Last time someone was saying i am not able to install jupyter notebook
25/09/2020, 1:19 am - +91 73966 05717: He's using his previous frustration on people who are asking good questions also :(
25/09/2020, 1:19 am - +91 98205 01619: What did sir told ? 😅
25/09/2020, 1:19 am - +91 89680 55931: Wht happen bcoz I joined nw
25/09/2020, 1:19 am - +91 90283 51722: There are so many people out here who are seeing these things for the first time so out of curiousity they don’t understand what they are asking
25/09/2020, 1:19 am - +91 73966 05717: Correct
25/09/2020, 1:20 am - +91 90283 51722: There are outliers 😂
25/09/2020, 1:20 am - +91 96209 98263: I have seen people asking to some other instructors many silly questions.   They would answer the same question 100 times in diff ways
25/09/2020, 1:20 am - +91 78777 29587: Agreed
25/09/2020, 1:20 am - +91 70218 21421: I think before joining course everyone did research on syllabus and all
25/09/2020, 1:20 am - +91 80775 83648: Nice discussion btw😛😂
25/09/2020, 1:21 am - +91 98205 01619: It is very nice
25/09/2020, 1:21 am - +91 90283 51722: Exactly. In every batch he will get mix crowd. People won’t join if they know everything.
25/09/2020, 1:21 am - +91 96209 98263: So I am also new to this kinda teaching .. where instructor scolds if we ask questions 😁
25/09/2020, 1:21 am - +91 77606 81865: I mean aptitude in coding is expected alteast might be in different language but you wont go very far without it
25/09/2020, 1:21 am - +91 80775 83648: 🤣🤣
25/09/2020, 1:23 am - +91 90283 51722: <Media omitted>

25/09/2020, 1:24 am - +91 90283 51722: Its affordable ML. People join first and then see what’s inside.
25/09/2020, 1:25 am - +91 77606 81865: 🤣🤣
25/09/2020, 1:25 am - +91 73966 05717: Now people started asking may "I ask you Sudanshu" 😅 and discipline came.
25/09/2020, 1:26 am - +91 70218 21421: 😅🤣
25/09/2020, 1:26 am - +91 90283 51722: <Media omitted>
25/09/2020, 1:27 am - +91 90283 51722: But I’m not getting share screen option by default
25/09/2020, 1:27 am - +91 73966 05717: Control is in their hands actually
25/09/2020, 1:27 am - +91 90283 51722: I don’t know if this options only after he scolds 🙄
25/09/2020, 1:28 am - +91 90283 51722: Maybe  @919820501619 can answer
25/09/2020, 1:28 am - +91 70305 91513: <Media omitted>
25/09/2020, 1:28 am - +91 98205 01619: It comes when he gives us permission I guess
25/09/2020, 1:29 am - +91 90283 51722: We use MS Teams for our office. Control is so easy there.
25/09/2020, 1:29 am - +91 90283 51722: I think so. Is it coming for you now?

25/09/2020, 1:32 am - +91 70086 24290: Aman 👍
25/09/2020, 1:33 am - +91 90283 51722: Aman OP
25/09/2020, 1:33 am - +91 95225 55491: What happened I left the meeting?
25/09/2020, 1:33 am - +91 98394 23547: Thanks every one😊
25/09/2020, 1:34 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Mujhe nahi lagta hai ki yeh difficult hai, kyun ki BCom ke background hote hue kuch log successful hai bhai
25/09/2020, 1:34 am - +91 70305 91513: *Kuch log*
25/09/2020, 1:35 am - +91 90283 51722: Ha na. Screen share kaise karna hai ye pata karne mein aadha course nikal jayega
25/09/2020, 1:35 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Agree😊
Iska matlab koi bhi karsakta hain.
25/09/2020, 1:35 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: 😂😂

Jo aage hoga uski 1 class cover krne me 1 week bhi kam pd jayega 😂
Ye thoda hard nahi boht hard course hain 
After 1 month's aram se enjoy karna

25/09/2020, 1:40 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Access maagne se dega na?
Pata nahi agar aaj kuch alag hua hai toh.
Main join nahi kiya tha aaj

25/09/2020, 1:42 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Aap screen share karne ka access maange the kya?
25/09/2020, 1:42 am - +91 90283 51722: Nai
25/09/2020, 1:42 am - +91 90283 51722: I thought it’s on him to accept
25/09/2020, 1:42 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Sudhanshu tab hi access dega jab aap maangoge
25/09/2020, 1:43 am - +91 90283 51722: Ohh. Thanks.
25/09/2020, 1:43 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: By default kisi ko bhi share karne ka option nahi hoga.
25/09/2020, 1:45 am - +91 90283 51722: Maybe as this is a public platform
25/09/2020, 1:45 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Aur aap unko batana hai ki aap screen share karna chahte . Nahi toh sirf audio unmute ka option dega
25/09/2020, 1:45 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Yeah. Otherwise it’s hard for him to control
25/09/2020, 1:46 am - +91 90283 51722: But audio bhi toh band hai
25/09/2020, 1:46 am - +91 90283 51722: I guess I need to raise hand first. Then only magic happens.
25/09/2020, 1:47 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Yes, that’s right
25/09/2020, 1:50 am - +91 96494 30924: +1
25/09/2020, 1:51 am - +91 99693 48412: Guys we should understand their situation too . It's not easy to handle this at one go. 
Also Sudanshu Sir is not well these days as told by Krish Sir
25/09/2020, 1:51 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Ohh...
Hope he gets well soon.
25/09/2020, 1:52 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Bechara bahut mehnat karta hain
25/09/2020, 1:52 am - +91 90283 51722: Too much of stress
25/09/2020, 1:54 am - +91 98205 01619: You know Krish sir ?
25/09/2020, 1:54 am - +91 98205 01619: Will he be teaching us something ?
25/09/2020, 1:55 am - +91 70218 21421: Yes he said in live today that from next month or something he will be taking some lectures of ineuron
25/09/2020, 1:55 am - +91 98205 01619: Today 🙄?
25/09/2020, 1:56 am - +91 70218 21421: https://youtu.be/UJfAZHb2VW0

25/09/2020, 1:56 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: He mentioned it in the induction session
25/09/2020, 1:56 am - +91 70218 21421: 21:00
25/09/2020, 1:57 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: 👍🏼
25/09/2020, 1:57 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: Hope everyone is following Dhaval Patel on Codebasics channel!
25/09/2020, 1:57 am - +91 99693 48412: Anyone who have also enrolled in upcoming DL course?
25/09/2020, 1:58 am - +91 95225 55491: I did
25/09/2020, 1:59 am - +91 90283 51722: <Media omitted>
25/09/2020, 2:10 am - +91 99534 53359: Will it be feasible to do both the dl and the ml courses simultaneously
25/09/2020, 2:10 am - +91 98205 01619: No
25/09/2020, 2:11 am - +91 98205 01619: First please master ML and if possible complete light courses like SQL for DS and Excel or Tableau.Give 2-3 hackathons and then move to DL
25/09/2020, 2:11 am - +91 98205 01619: This is my opinion
25/09/2020, 2:12 am - +91 98730 17579: 😂😂😂😂😂
25/09/2020, 2:13 am - +91 99693 48412: I'm too confused about it .
25/09/2020, 2:13 am - +91 99534 53359: Yeah same here
25/09/2020, 2:14 am - +91 99693 48412: Pre requisite for DL is only python as per the course
25/09/2020, 2:14 am - +1 (512) 998-2438: When I asked Sudhanshu, he said anyone start with DL as long as we are comfortable with Python and Stats
25/09/2020, 2:15 am - +91 95383 45295: I am having i3 system.
Whether it is possible to do all DL learning through   Google Colab/Any cloud platform for free
25/09/2020, 2:15 am - +91 98205 01619: Also what's your goal and purpose of learning ML and DL will decide that.
25/09/2020, 2:17 am - +91 99693 48412: Ultimate goal is of course Data scientist transition.
After watching some live data interview I think company wants that the candidate must be good in both DL and ML .
25/09/2020, 2:18 am - +91 95383 45295: Yes??
25/09/2020, 2:18 am - +91 90283 51722: <Media omitted>
25/09/2020, 2:20 am - +91 99693 48412: If any one who have given interviews please share your experiences
25/09/2020, 2:20 am - +91 99534 53359: Same here only thing I know we can't develop full fledge projects through pycharm or pytorch having ram less than 8
25/09/2020, 2:25 am - +91 98867 24944: Company wants many things.. SQL, Python, ML, DL, Keras, Tensorflow, Spark, Aws, Azure
25/09/2020, 2:25 am - +91 98867 24944: It's full stack. Need to first master ML
25/09/2020, 2:26 am - +91 95383 45295: In Google Cloud ,There is some free membership for few months (GCP AI).
But before enrolling we should know how run all those stuff
25/09/2020, 2:26 am - +91 98867 24944: Majorly it should be done on Colab or cloud. Local machines won't support
25/09/2020, 2:27 am - +91 95383 45295: 👍
25/09/2020, 2:27 am - +91 95383 45295: Yes
25/09/2020, 2:28 am - +91 98867 24944: As far as I know, Google is totally free.
25/09/2020, 2:28 am - +91 99693 48412: 👍🏻👍🏻 .
25/09/2020, 2:29 am - +91 97412 25324: 👍
25/09/2020, 2:29 am - +91 99693 48412: Ok . thanks . It's better to concentrate on ML first
25/09/2020, 2:29 am - +91 98867 24944: Azure, Aws cloud platforms are free upto certain credit amount. These r used for deployments.

25/09/2020, 2:32 am - +91 98867 24944: This is the reality.
25/09/2020, 2:33 am - +91 95383 45295: So we should be Master in  Pandas and Numpy
25/09/2020, 2:33 am - +91 89680 55931: Wht they said about community classes?
25/09/2020, 2:34 am - +91 89680 55931: I joined late today anyone asked
25/09/2020, 2:34 am - +91 98867 24944: Yes.
25/09/2020, 2:35 am - +91 98867 24944: Even I don't see any community classes running. Not sure
25/09/2020, 2:41 am - +91 99693 48412: Yes it's not running. Although sir will upload videos later on
25/09/2020, 2:41 am - +91 95383 45295: Power Bi and Tableau is there
25/09/2020, 2:42 am - +91 98867 24944: Oh ok.. yup need to learn that also
25/09/2020, 3:03 am - +91 98858 15897: We should be master in understanding the problem. If you have given a dataset there are different ways to see it. But understanding the importance of each parameter and the impacts of it and what we are going to solve needs a subject expertise. For that either need to be in that industry or try our hands in a similar domain in kaggle.
25/09/2020, 3:19 am - +91 98821 90185: This is so true.... 99.99% of the time it ML part would be already there and we need to work around it. Data setup, pipeline, report to business and all

25/09/2020, 6:04 am - Nasik Sami: good one bro! Good to see you have shown the time comparisons but you could have stressed less about explaining the installation process. For examples would give better insights. Overall good overview of the library 👌
25/09/2020, 6:16 am - +91 98821 90185: installation is okay
few more examples would be better

25/09/2020, 10:39 am - +91 98205 01619: Execute the code given  and later post your error if you got any.
25/09/2020, 10:47 am - +91 70218 21421: See I also mentioned the video and timing below it
25/09/2020, 10:59 am - Nasik Sami: Thanks a lot bro! works perfectly
25/09/2020, 11:01 am - Nasik Sami: is there any command you know which works exactly with this:
print('\t Mean = %.2f' % ___________________) # Prints the mean of the column
cause the question is type of fill in the blanks category where I have to keep the parts the have provided and fill the rest
25/09/2020, 12:30 pm - +91 97790 45472: One question guys - 
If we are performing target encoding on the training data for few categorical features... How are we gonna use that model on test data where we don't have any target feature given...??
25/09/2020, 12:35 pm - +91 97412 25324: Train and test data should be in sync in terms of features (columns) then only any model ll work
25/09/2020, 12:36 pm - +91 86109 02042: 💯
25/09/2020, 12:41 pm - +91 88008 73017: Hi
Does anyone knows the topic to be covered in tomorrow's and day after's class
25/09/2020, 12:42 pm - +91 86109 02042: Numpy remaining
25/09/2020, 12:43 pm - +91 97790 45472: I get the point... I have two csv one has features and target value....
2nd csv has only same features we have to predict target for it
25/09/2020, 12:43 pm - +91 97412 25324: Yes
25/09/2020, 12:44 pm - +91 97412 25324: That is the only difference in train and test
25/09/2020, 12:45 pm - +91 97790 45472: I created model on 1st Csv and did some target encoding.. For few categories...
I did train test split and trained the model and tested the model... I see its giving good results
25/09/2020, 12:45 pm - +91 97790 45472: Now i want to use same model for test. Csv
25/09/2020, 12:46 pm - +91 86109 02042: For that pipeline concept is taking place...
25/09/2020, 12:46 pm - +91 97790 45472: For that test.csv how to target encode the categorical feature...?? Are we goona pass the target encoding from training set to test set..??
25/09/2020, 12:47 pm - +91 86109 02042: Make a pipeline in that the data goes...makes manipulation..for test and train data
25/09/2020, 12:48 pm - +91 86109 02042: You can manually do the same manipulation before test your data..

When is stats expected yo start? Any idea
25/09/2020, 12:48 pm - +91 86109 02042: I think next week but not sure
25/09/2020, 12:49 pm - +91 86109 02042: I think we have many topics to be covered in numpy so stats will be start in next week
25/09/2020, 12:49 pm - +91 97790 45472: Ohhh kay... I m pretty new... Can u recommend any videos or tutorial i can refer..?
25/09/2020, 12:50 pm - +91 86109 02042: You can watch krish naik's pipeline video... And i am also pretty new
25/09/2020, 12:50 pm - +91 97790 45472: Ohkay let me check... Thank u so much
25/09/2020, 12:51 pm - +91 86109 02042: https://youtu.be/irHhDMbw3xo
25/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 86109 02042: This is best video for pipeline concept.
25/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 97412 25324: Treat the test data in same pattern like train for all preprocessing steps
25/09/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 97412 25324: 👍
25/09/2020, 12:54 pm - +91 86109 02042: <Media omitted>
25/09/2020, 12:54 pm - +91 97790 45472: Yes.. But the thing is test data will not have target feature... So u can't compute the encoding
25/09/2020, 12:54 pm - +91 97790 45472: I hope u r getting it..
25/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 86109 02042: Can you share the dataset?...
25/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 86109 02042: This can't be....
25/09/2020, 12:56 pm - +91 97412 25324: In train data also 1st we exclude our target feature and then perform preprocessing  so it should be same like test data
25/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 86109 02042: 💯
25/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 88008 73017: Thankyou
25/09/2020, 12:58 pm - +91 97790 45472: Let me share a screenshot
25/09/2020, 12:58 pm - +91 98205 01619: Go for CATBOOST avoid handling categories values. if you want to used LightGBM then go for manual integer encoding of the values and then later use Weight Averaging if it is showing any improvement
25/09/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 98205 01619: Please have a look at the latest Bank Marketing campaign - I have used CATBOOST and LIGHTGBM to decide which is better  so that later i can do parameter tuning and some feature engineering

25/09/2020, 1:58 pm - +91 73966 05717: Gaurav plotted a lot like a pro. His insights from the model using CATBOOST, LIGHTGBM & Ensembling them are good and at last he concluded very well.  Eventhough model is not that perfect,you did it at most.
Keep it up bro🙂

We should create a group on any portal where all our work and documents could be stored..
25/09/2020, 10:38 pm - +91 83848 05339: Or may be.. we can create a group in github and collaborate there
25/09/2020, 10:40 pm - +91 83848 05339: while working in company, u guys will be needing github, so by this, we can get equipped with git version control as well

26/09/2020, 1:26 am - +91 80775 52350: 3 months max with assignment
26/09/2020, 1:27 am - +91 95884 39050: And in every 45 days iNeuron is going to circulate a form for the internship i guess
26/09/2020, 1:28 am - +91 80775 52350: Yes
26/09/2020, 1:29 am - +91 95884 39050: Is the assignments too hard?
26/09/2020, 1:30 am - +91 95884 39050: Actually I have not started with assignments yet I am first watching the videos
26/09/2020, 1:30 am - +91 95884 39050: Should I watch all the videos first and then assignments or should do parallely both
26/09/2020, 1:30 am - +91 95884 39050: What is recommended?
26/09/2020, 1:31 am - +91 99693 48412: Assignment are not hard. U can complete them if some concepts are clear also Google is there to help
26/09/2020, 1:31 am - +91 80775 52350: Parallely both will be recommended by me
26/09/2020, 1:31 am - +91 88265 99252: This one!

26/09/2020, 2:58 am - +91 88989 56652: Bt if we are not yet started with core ML algorithms thn what will do in internship
26/09/2020, 3:05 am - +91 70139 04382: I think internship is for those who have completed 70% of course content (including assignments) I mean for fast track people. That’s what Sudhanshu ji said in his very first introduction class.Unless and until 70 % of course content is not finished they will not consider you for internship

26/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 91372 62517: Yeah can you little bit more specific about what you're trying to achieve?
26/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 91372 62517: From my understanding you trying to say you need to sum an individual column from a dataset without numpy() is it?
26/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 98205 01619: Give sum(axis = 0)
26/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 98205 01619: If you have 4 columns each column value sum you will get and type of that would be a list

27/09/2020, 12:35 pm - +91 94920 31159: I think sir is explaining very well and I am a fresher too....If u practice what sir is saying its not gonna be a problem
27/09/2020, 12:48 pm - +91 95383 45295: Everything is available in YouTube..we will get 100 's of channels..we are paying for our attention.
I Think it is worth to pay 3.5 K with internship and Certification.
For this syllabus many institute charging 50K to 1.5 Lakh
27/09/2020, 12:49 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yes true
27/09/2020, 12:50 pm - +91 94920 31159: Yes
27/09/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 98205 01619: You need to do your research work and spend time have proper time management
27/09/2020, 12:56 pm - +91 98205 01619: So I feel in less cost you are getting more knowledge and nice curriculum. Just need to devote time and have proper time management
27/09/2020, 12:56 pm - +91 98205 01619: If you feel you cannot then I feel something is wrong
27/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 70139 04382: Yes I agree, every instructor has his way of teaching, sometimes we may understand it sometimes not. Best option is to refer multiple sources to get better clarity. Though I am a complete non programmer I am getting gist of it because I refer YouTube, udemy along with this course and it helps, I pickup few things from one instructor and rest from various sources
27/09/2020, 12:58 pm - +91 98858 15897: I would disagree because right from the python Sudhanshu has thought from very basics and in-depth I’m not good at coding but after i went through the python classes i have done my assignments by my own. Not only python the pandas and numpy which he thought so far is very simplified and clear. Maybe we need to spend time in learning and practicing
27/09/2020, 1:00 pm - +91 98858 15897: But I only have concern regarding the Mongo DB and Flask module thought by Virat. It was not proper and in the MongoDB he directly went opening pycharm and doing it but was not told how to create environment and all. I have a doubt now which is after completing the Exception handling should we go for MongoDB and Flask module or go to the Image Scrapper project module?

can anyone help me??
27/09/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 78931 57713: It would better if had a qna session at the end of the live class itself right

27/09/2020, 1:36 pm - +91 99693 48412: True . We are paying so that we get good push and have a clear path of where we are heading . We can to it on our own but it will take long time   .

27/09/2020, 2:29 pm - Nasik Sami: First elements in the tuples will have same interger value means i2 and second two elements will be assigned i8
27/09/2020, 2:30 pm - Nasik Sami: so 1&3=i2 
     2&4=i8
27/09/2020, 2:30 pm - +91 70218 21421: and 'a' or 'b' u can use them as index ...am I right?
27/09/2020, 2:31 pm - Nasik Sami: i2 will take 16 bits from your memory 
i8 will take 64 bits from your memory
27/09/2020, 2:32 pm - Nasik Sami: yeah by a and b you are assigning the allocated memory as you wish to those elements
27/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 70218 21421: i - integer
b - boolean
u - unsigned integer
f - float
c - complex float
m - timedelta
M - datetime
O - object
S - string
U - unicode string
V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )

27/09/2020, 3:35 pm - +91 88008 73017: Nice. Table extraction is an ongoing and biggest problem itself. 
If you can further extended this to extracting different types of table structures, OCR & Machine readable, and tables spread over multiple pages.
This would not just be a hot selling blog but a project on the CV that will highly valuable

We will have better judgment on choosing the module as we practice 😊
27/09/2020, 9:08 pm - +91 95383 45295: Generally marplot/Searborn is enough I guess

28/09/2020, 3:45 am - +91 98858 15897: Yes! From the website it’s routing to a 404 page
28/09/2020, 3:46 am - +91 78931 57713: may be the team is working on it

28/09/2020, 6:03 am - +91 78931 57713: please spare ur time and let me know how did i do it
28/09/2020, 11:19 am - +91 98205 01619: The legends are not proper.

To organise the legends properly please do the following.

*plt.legend(loc = 'upper left', bbox_to_anchor = (1,1))*

I would suggest explore more legend parameters like to give fancy look 3D layout shadow.

Just try above code and come back.

28/09/2020, 1:07 pm - +91 89196 77432: Use fillna() function to that single column
28/09/2020, 1:07 pm - +91 99582 37183: df['column'].fillna(Value)
28/09/2020, 1:07 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yeah
28/09/2020, 1:08 pm - +91 73966 05717: df['col'].fillna(val)
28/09/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 81910 46802: Yeah that I know but I have multiple values to replace in a particular column not a single value
28/09/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 99582 37183: then use apply function
28/09/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 99537 20991: Use imputation methods
28/09/2020, 1:10 pm - +91 73966 05717: Or 
df['Column'] = df['Column'].replace(np.nan, number)
28/09/2020, 1:10 pm - +91 99537 20991: Check for categorical and numerical columns and work on them separately
28/09/2020, 6:27 pm - +91 98858 15897: Did anyone felt that the in the flask recording many topics within it were rushed up?
28/09/2020, 6:27 pm - +91 98858 15897: I mean things which are need to be explained in a bit detail were overlooked
28/09/2020, 6:28 pm - +91 98858 15897: Since I’m a newbie I felt that. I never felt the same thing while going through python modules
28/09/2020, 6:32 pm - +91 94278 46144: If so check YouTube @codewithharry
28/09/2020, 6:33 pm - +91 98858 15897: Sure will do that👍🏻
28/09/2020, 6:34 pm - +91 98394 23547: 😵😵
28/09/2020, 9:31 pm - +91 77606 81865: hello, so i have been working on titanic data set, and i have to predict the survival rate , considering the fact that gender plays a role : what do you think i should be more inclined towards MALE or FEMALE?
28/09/2020, 9:32 pm - +91 98205 01619: Kaggle it
28/09/2020, 9:32 pm - +91 77606 81865: no i am asking a genuine question.
28/09/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 77606 81865: which one would have a greater impact on survival
28/09/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 98205 01619: Do EDA
28/09/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 98205 01619: And derive insights
28/09/2020, 9:34 pm - +91 81869 29883: As per my EDA , survival rate of female was more than male
28/09/2020, 9:35 pm - +91 81869 29883: But if you look generally, both can be considered , as males are physically strong , so their chance of survival is great, where as  it is possible that during the Titanic disaster women and children were saved first , so their chance of survival is great too
28/09/2020, 9:35 pm - +91 81869 29883: So depends on your perception
28/09/2020, 10:27 pm - +91 74040 77008: Kisi ne exception handling ki ass. Ka 2 ques kia h to kch bta do ye simple loop ya itertool se ho jaega

28/09/2020, 11:03 pm - +91 98858 15897: You need to go for 3 for loops.
28/09/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 93484 29088: Itertool use kardo asanise hojayega

29/09/2020, 11:40 am - +91 95101 07982: <Media omitted>
29/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 99537 20991: This might be based on the domain knowledge you need to explain more here
29/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 99537 20991: What these variables means and what are you trying to achieve for score
29/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 99537 20991: In what sense and all
29/09/2020, 11:51 am - +91 95101 07982: Thanks a ton for your quick response.
29/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 95101 07982: So we are trying to figure out score on the basis three different sales variables. First variable is sales qty second variable  is gross margin earned on it third variable is new products contribution. These all variables have been normalized. 
As you rightly pointed our that weightage have been assigned as per domain knowledge as of now. What we want in this  business use case is to identify the way to assign weightages in a scientific way.
29/09/2020, 11:58 am - +91 99537 20991: Yes that's what I am saying you need to dig into more for domain Knowledge and research to get that final score output and interpret what scientific formula is being applied here
29/09/2020, 11:58 am - +91 99537 20991: As a Data Scientist we need to research for each and every thing in respect to domain to domain
29/09/2020, 11:59 am - +91 99537 20991: Every domain and every case will be different
29/09/2020, 12:03 pm - +91 88008 73017: How have you converted all the variables in similar unit, i.e. how have you normalised it
29/09/2020, 12:07 pm - +91 88008 73017: Also, are there other variables as well. How are these weights? Are these %, if yes, then they don't add up to 100
Also what would the score you want to calculate signify, High % means what v/s low %
29/09/2020, 12:07 pm - +91 88008 73017: @919510107982
29/09/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 95101 07982: Have corrected scores its 100 only
29/09/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 95101 07982: <Media omitted>
29/09/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 95101 07982: These are percentages and I want to bucket them basis their high n low scores.
29/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 88008 73017: But what would high score means in business terms, whats the use of this score
29/09/2020, 12:19 pm - +91 95101 07982: The idea is to find out score basis that we will give priority to the customers.
29/09/2020, 12:21 pm - +91 88008 73017: Ahhh
So you in short want to categories your customers into top, medium, low types, or some other nomenclature you may want to use.
29/09/2020, 12:22 pm - +91 95101 07982: Exactly
29/09/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 95101 07982: As of now we have applied domain expertise to find out weightages. My team wants scientific way of doing that.
29/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 88008 73017: Ok, generally it is done the non statistical way i.e doing an ABC analysis
But if you want to use this method, then their are certain issues i see
29/09/2020, 12:38 pm - +91 88008 73017: Are these weights really from some domain expert?
29/09/2020, 12:38 pm - +91 88008 73017: And what domain are we talking here?
29/09/2020, 12:43 pm - +91 95101 07982: Yes

30/09/2020, 1:01 am - +91 73966 05717: Nope
30/09/2020, 1:01 am - +91 70139 04382: Oh ok

30/09/2020, 1:30 am - +91 77278 58500: TBH, "value" doesn't necessarily mean numerical value. But there isn't something like maximum in strings, but longest.
30/09/2020, 1:30 am - +91 77278 58500: Yup, my bad.
30/09/2020, 1:34 am - +91 75981 60996: Please use continue key word while iteration list..it will drop string and then append to list and then use max function to get max number

30/09/2020, 4:10 am - +91 92054 17057: Can someone please explain what is one hot encoding?
30/09/2020, 4:13 am - +91 77606 81865: so this encoding method is just like integer encoding but instead we use binary numbers
30/09/2020, 4:14 am - +91 77606 81865: for example: YES :1(numerical encoding) :001(one hot encoding0
30/09/2020, 4:19 am - +91 99537 20991: One hot encoding allows us to represent categorical data into numerical data
30/09/2020, 4:19 am - +91 99537 20991: Since many of our machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with categorical data
30/09/2020, 4:20 am - +91 99537 20991: For eg we have four categorical data values available in a column:
Petrol 
Diesel
CNG
LPG
And these values are repeated
30/09/2020, 4:20 am - +91 99537 20991: So using one hot encoding we convert this into 0 or 1
30/09/2020, 4:53 am - +91 92054 17057: Thank you so much 😊

Defective cities
Error free city1
Defective city1
Defective city1

03/10/2020, 7:58 pm - +91 91121 89508: I guess from tomorrow
03/10/2020, 7:58 pm - +91 89196 77432: What abt EDA
03/10/2020, 7:58 pm - +91 89196 77432: ?
03/10/2020, 7:58 pm - +91 98858 15897: After ploty,cufflinks and seaborn topics are done the statistics class will be taught
03/10/2020, 7:59 pm - +91 89196 77432: There is one module know... like rest api and sql and all..?
03/10/2020, 7:59 pm - +91 89196 77432: EDA videos are not uploaded ?
03/10/2020, 7:59 pm - +91 98858 15897: EDA will make sense with statistics so soon after the visualization and statistics is done we have to do EDA
03/10/2020, 8:00 pm - +91 89196 77432: Okay
03/10/2020, 8:00 pm - +91 98858 15897: It’s already uploaded. And it’s not SQL it’s about a NOSQL -MongoDB
03/10/2020, 8:01 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yeah uploaded ...but he will teach know..!
03/10/2020, 8:02 pm - +91 98858 15897: No i don’t think so
03/10/2020, 8:02 pm - +91 89196 77432: Okay
03/10/2020, 8:06 pm - +91 89196 77432: Class started ?
03/10/2020, 8:06 pm - +91 99537 20991: Not now

03/10/2020, 8:06 pm - +91 99537 20991: You don't have the canvas access?
03/10/2020, 8:07 pm - +91 73389 99876: can anyone

03/10/2020, 8:08 pm - +91 89196 77432: No
03/10/2020, 8:11 pm - +91 88008 73017: Why do they always start late?
03/10/2020, 8:11 pm - +91 89196 77432: I think they are busy in their works ...
03/10/2020, 8:12 pm - +91 89196 77432: But they are giving the clear concepts
03/10/2020, 8:12 pm - +91 98205 01619: Statistics is not covered na today ?
03/10/2020, 8:14 pm - +91 98394 23547: no

03/10/2020, 9:45 pm - +91 98205 01619: I missed today's lecture  @918919677432  let me know later please
03/10/2020, 9:46 pm - +91 88008 73017: I am glad, he is trying to finish seaborn today only
As spending equal time on all visualization Library doesn't make any sense anyways
03/10/2020, 9:47 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: https://youtu.be/0P7QnIQDBJY
03/10/2020, 9:47 pm - +91 89196 77432: Okay

03/10/2020, 9:49 pm - +91 99693 48412: He knows everyone might be bored😄
03/10/2020, 9:50 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: He already said that Seaborne is another boring karke
03/10/2020, 9:50 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: But still he is walking through 😀
03/10/2020, 9:50 pm - +91 99442 80682: Do anyone searched for forward button sometime and then realized its a live session?
03/10/2020, 10:02 pm - +91 98858 15897: Thank god the flask and python projects are covered. I thought those will be skipped🤩😇
03/10/2020, 10:03 pm - +91 77278 58500: Yea, kinda 😂
03/10/2020, 10:03 pm - +91 77278 58500: His English is cancerous at times

03/10/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 89680 55931: Seaborn plotty ad cufflinks
03/10/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 89196 77432: English  is a medium to communicate only... 😜
03/10/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 99442 80682: Yeah.  But anyone noticed 'easiest possible way'
03/10/2020, 10:08 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Hope study groups would help a lot
03/10/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 77278 58500: But you are getting all your information in English, it matters.
03/10/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yeah , i think we are able to decode what he is saying right🤪
03/10/2020, 10:10 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Agree!!! But it’s fine as long as we understand what he is trying to explain 😊
03/10/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yes , Agreed ...🙂
03/10/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 98858 15897: He’s a fantastic teacher by the way. Like the way he approaches any subject and tries to dissect it for us. Except for the long sessions which sometimes makes it tiring
03/10/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 91609 66166: yes, n the confidence level also is amazing irrespective of his language skills
03/10/2020, 10:13 pm - +91 78931 57713: Was flask covered in today's class
03/10/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 90609 59777: No
03/10/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yes😍
03/10/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 89196 77432: Agreed😊
03/10/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 98858 15897: True
03/10/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 88008 73017: Yes, because he knows the subject
03/10/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 89680 55931: No
03/10/2020, 10:16 pm - +91 89680 55931: Yes
03/10/2020, 10:17 pm - +91 77278 58500: I would prefer Krish sir
03/10/2020, 10:18 pm - +91 78931 57713: Both are prefect in their own style of teaching
03/10/2020, 10:18 pm - +91 77278 58500: I differ
03/10/2020, 10:19 pm - +91 98858 15897: I was one among the earliest subscriber of Krish. He’s amazing no doubt in that.Big of him. Sudhanshu is no less. Again it’s to individual preference. Krish is the reason we started to have good AI community
03/10/2020, 10:20 pm - +91 98858 15897: Big fan of him*
03/10/2020, 10:20 pm - +91 77278 58500: Yeah.
03/10/2020, 10:21 pm - +91 98858 15897: For me I personally like Krish, Sudhanshu and Srikanth Varma(Applied AI). Fantastic teachers wish I had teachers like them in my college. Very practical oriented teaching these guys have. Solid subject understanding too
03/10/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 94278 46144: Has anyone enrolled for bussiness  analytics  course?
03/10/2020, 10:40 pm - +91 91609 66166: Yes..... .I've enrolled
03/10/2020, 10:41 pm - +91 78931 57713: How is that?
03/10/2020, 10:41 pm - +91 91609 66166: Today just induction only
03/10/2020, 10:42 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: Agree !!!!
Dhaval (code basics) would be first person on my list 😊
03/10/2020, 10:42 pm - +91 98858 15897: Yeah totally forgot about him. He’s awesome too. Good chap

03/10/2020, 10:51 pm - +91 88008 73017: Why would one enroll to a business analyst course when you are already doing this ML one
03/10/2020, 10:51 pm - +91 88008 73017: Just learn a visualization tool, and work on your business acumen and understanding
03/10/2020, 10:54 pm - +91 98205 01619: *I would request everyone in your free time please help me to get more like or clap (You can give unlimited i guess) on medium article what I have written. Please find the links to it.*

03/10/2020, 10:55 pm - +91 95383 45295: For starting data engineer    may be business analytics helpful..I think
03/10/2020, 10:59 pm - +91 88008 73017: Business analytics role is nothing but visualization in industry. A course won't help
Take up Tableau, PowerBI or Qlik
Create some dashboard, host them and add links in your resume
If someone is starting, all the interviewer would be interested in is, what visualization you create and how does that help to unravel some business insights
03/10/2020, 11:02 pm - +91 88008 73017: Just a suggestion though
03/10/2020, 11:02 pm - +91 73966 05717: Correct

04/10/2020, 9:57 pm - +1 (512) 998-2438: My recommendation is to practice SQL activities in SQL editors and try to practice the same from Python.
Ppl who are brand new to SQL may get confused with Python vs SQL functionalities.
04/10/2020, 9:58 pm - +91 73966 05717: 👌🏼👌🏼
04/10/2020, 9:58 pm - +91 77278 58500: It would be enough to get started

04/10/2020, 10:40 pm - +91 88008 73017: Do basic SQL course from Kaggle
04/10/2020, 10:40 pm - +91 88008 73017: Simple, straightforward and highly effective
04/10/2020, 10:40 pm - +91 70139 04382: Ya keggle...heard lot about it....time to pay a visit to keggle
04/10/2020, 10:41 pm - +91 77606 81865: yess
04/10/2020, 10:43 pm - +91 70139 04382: I learned up to classes and I thought that would be enough to join this course but turns out that I knew very little and there are dragons like pandas, mathplotlib, now this SQL...and things are going above my head with the speed of ongoing class...best course of action: got to prepare in advance before class or else I will be staring in blue 😅😂
04/10/2020, 10:46 pm - +91 88008 73017: SQL is very easy Buddy.
As simple as writing English, plus you don't need to master anything
Just understand the basic premise of these and then simply use Google/stackoverflow when ever you are stuck
04/10/2020, 10:46 pm - +91 88008 73017: Most effective way of learning is by doing
04/10/2020, 10:46 pm - +91 99961 33387: True!!
04/10/2020, 10:47 pm - +91 70139 04382: Ya
04/10/2020, 10:47 pm - +91 99961 33387: Does anyone here has any case study on SQL? Or may be direct me towards a web source for that...

04/10/2020, 11:42 pm - +91 89196 77432: I did not understand anything in today's class😪😪😭
04/10/2020, 11:43 pm - +91 89786 32375: I didn't understand much either.
Guess we need to go through the recorded video once again
04/10/2020, 11:44 pm - +91 89196 77432: Yeah
05/10/2020, 1:09 am - +91 88008 73017: Don't go for a separate case study
Instead try to perform same steps on same data you used for pandas
05/10/2020, 1:10 am - +91 88008 73017: The relatibility would help you learn SQL better
05/10/2020, 1:11 am - +91 77278 58500: 👍
05/10/2020, 1:18 am - +91 77278 58500: Basically, what he was trying to teach today was that how can you connect to the SQL databases.

Cuz you wouldn't always get the database in the formats like CSV, JSON, etcetera.   

And you can always convert the SQL database into the List, then you can convert it into Dataframe and apply Pandas.
05/10/2020, 1:19 am - +91 89196 77432: Okay
05/10/2020, 1:36 am - +91 94798 31237: Today's class has been uploaded. 😊

05/10/2020, 3:24 am - +91 88008 73017: I am facing issues with the files used in today's class.
When i download zip files and extract its contents, it throws errors, and the only extracted are useless 0 kbs
05/10/2020, 3:25 am - +91 88008 73017: Anyone else also facing the same issue
05/10/2020, 3:25 am - +91 77278 58500: Which one?

05/10/2020, 3:28 am - +91 98205 01619: And come up with solutions
05/10/2020, 3:28 am - +91 77278 58500: Just extract the SQL one for now
05/10/2020, 3:28 am - +91 77278 58500: And I think he changed the MongoDB file later on
05/10/2020, 3:29 am - +91 77278 58500: You can check the lecture
05/10/2020, 3:31 am - +91 70139 04382: Bro winrar is showing this error nowdays, use 7zip
05/10/2020, 3:32 am - +91 70139 04382: Not sure about name, it’s something like that
05/10/2020, 3:34 am - +91 88008 73017: 7-zip it is
Worked perfectly
Thank you

05/10/2020, 11:06 am - +91 98205 01619: I wanted for 64 bit
05/10/2020, 11:06 am - +91 98205 01619: The one which you shared is for 32 bit
05/10/2020, 11:15 am - +91 90365 26141: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

This may help you.
05/10/2020, 11:16 am - +91 90365 26141: But he gave 32 bit link only and we have installed 32 bit only.
05/10/2020, 11:25 am - +91 77278 58500: He was just showing how can you connect and what changes can you make from python to SQL databases in it. So, 32 bit would be more than enough. 

There not much point mastering SQL. MongoDB and Flask are more important.

Thank you, Mr. Prashant. It is useful information. I was looking for this kind of solution to that problem.
05/10/2020, 2:58 pm - +91 77278 58500: No problem. TBH I don't like antiviruses. 

I sometimes even keep the windows defender off while installing third-party software or game.
05/10/2020, 3:17 pm - +91 90365 26141: That's better
05/10/2020, 3:40 pm - +91 70139 04382: I know this is an inappropriate place to ask but did anyone of you enroll in IITM online degree program and have started submission of week1 assignments? today it was supposed to be released but I can't find it anywhere...not in dashboard also
05/10/2020, 4:24 pm - +91 90365 26141: I am not aware of that Mr. Kalyan
05/10/2020, 4:25 pm - +91 90365 26141: @917013904382 
Have you joined in that program?
05/10/2020, 4:25 pm - +91 70139 04382: I got it, they are updating it so will take some time
05/10/2020, 4:25 pm - +91 70139 04382: Yes

05/10/2020, 4:26 pm - +91 90365 26141: No
05/10/2020, 4:26 pm - +91 90365 26141: fee is high right?
05/10/2020, 4:27 pm - +91 70139 04382: First year is 30 k and it is a degree from IIT so it worth it
05/10/2020, 4:28 pm - +91 70139 04382: I mean it will take lot of my time and efforts but easy way to get an IIT degree
05/10/2020, 4:28 pm - +91 90365 26141: yes correct..
05/10/2020, 4:28 pm - +91 90365 26141: I hope.... You can share your experiences and knowledge with us.

05/10/2020, 4:29 pm - +91 90365 26141: Currently what concept is going on there now?
05/10/2020, 4:30 pm - +91 70139 04382: They have started with basics, discussing about sets in mathematics 1, algorithm in Computational thinking, phonetics in English and types of variables in stats
05/10/2020, 4:30 pm - +91 70139 04382: Very basic stuff
05/10/2020, 4:30 pm - +91 70139 04382: But assignments are tough
05/10/2020, 4:30 pm - +91 90365 26141: oh okay
05/10/2020, 4:31 pm - +91 90365 26141: you can share assignments with us. if possible, we will help.

05/10/2020, 4:32 pm - +91 77278 58500: Can you share the syllabus.
05/10/2020, 4:32 pm - +91 77278 58500: Seems interesting.
05/10/2020, 4:33 pm - +91 90365 26141: Okay
05/10/2020, 4:33 pm - +91 70139 04382: Depends on your time management and assets availability....I donno much about that course but if it is from Stanford it must be good
05/10/2020, 4:35 pm - +91 70139 04382: https://www.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/course_pages/BSCMA1001_week_1.html

05/10/2020, 4:36 pm - +91 90365 26141: 👍
05/10/2020, 4:36 pm - +91 70139 04382: If you go back you can see course details, fee structure, syllabus (its not that descriptive...just gives a layout) and other stuff
05/10/2020, 4:45 pm - +91 89680 55931: We have to registered for this

05/10/2020, 5:13 pm - +91 98205 01619: Anyone knows using github I want to create sub repository for my repository grajpal/deep_learning_images
05/10/2020, 5:13 pm - +91 98205 01619: Is git required for it ?

Can we do it without git ?
05/10/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 70139 04382: Sorry but last date to register was 15th sept.....now they have entered evaluation phase....we will have exam on 22 Nov and those who pass the exam can enroll in the course
05/10/2020, 5:24 pm - +91 88008 73017: You can use it by using GitHub interface
Create folder, upload files etc., But that will not be the ideal way
I would highly recommend using git, basic git push/pull are straightforward, and anyways thats what you use in industry
05/10/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 76589 22718: Yeah..i have enrolled..
I guess what they have released previously is the week1 content.
05/10/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 70139 04382: Ya they released the content but today they were supposed to release week 1 assignment.....since I have watched all the week 1 content so i was planning to attempt Assignments to avoid last minute haste
05/10/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 94278 46144: The access of videos are open for all?
05/10/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 91469 16005: Yes I think.
05/10/2020, 5:58 pm - +91 91469 16005: But week wise they are releasing
05/10/2020, 6:02 pm - +91 70139 04382: Not all videos, just week 1 content of all qualifier exam I guess
05/10/2020, 6:14 pm - +91 76589 22718: Yeah i too didn't find any update..
Hoping they will mail us sooner or later.
Let's just wait!!

As in nos of neurons in hidden layer

And if for example 1st hidden layer as 100 neurons how much 2nd hidden layers should have it

I have 2352 nos of images of shape 224x224*3 which so I converted them into 1D using X.reshape(X.shape[0], 224*224*3)

09/10/2020, 11:50 pm - +91 75083 05508: Btw anyone here who's registered for the deep learning course starting tomorrow ?
10/10/2020, 12:49 am - +91 98205 01619: Handling 2 courses side by side it would be difficult you all do jot feel ?
10/10/2020, 12:56 am - Nasik Sami: it will be and also maintaining university courses simultaneously
10/10/2020, 12:59 am - +91 70139 04382: Agreed, unless there is a proper time management and discipline both time and money will be under jeopardy. I am already realising it and changing my routine but still got long way to go
10/10/2020, 1:09 am - +91 98205 01619: Self study is best
10/10/2020, 1:09 am - +91 98205 01619: You also know how Sudhanshu sir is
10/10/2020, 1:09 am - +91 98205 01619: Behaviour
10/10/2020, 1:10 am - +91 98205 01619: I registered since curriculum is good waiting for Statistics and ML to start
10/10/2020, 1:10 am - +91 98205 01619: Inspite of having register for Analytics Vidhya
10/10/2020, 1:15 am - +91 95225 55491: I too have enrolled in course and I was was confused while joining them contemporarily but if we join it individually it will be a 16 month long process so it may need a little hard work and lots of time management but I felt much time will be saved secondly I understand sometimes Sudhanshu is not in his best behaviour but no doubt he is a good mentor with lots of knowledge  and at this price they are offering a lot which costs lakhs from any other institution like GL na upgrad also they don’t provide any kind of internship which I felt is definitely a plus .
Just my two cents .
10/10/2020, 1:21 am - +91 88008 73017: The internship is free and not paid. So the time you will spend on it is added cost for you, and saving on labor cost for ineuron. Also, running course for 3K with 1000 participants is huge revenue.
10/10/2020, 1:29 am - +91 95225 55491: I am just sharing my my opinion as previously I had a bad experience with an institution there course content was really old and they took a heavy fees .
10/10/2020, 1:30 am - +44 7722 929618: Anyone got idea how the internships will be. How the project will be allocated and how they monitor the progress
10/10/2020, 1:31 am - +91 89680 55931: If u got snd me also

10/10/2020, 1:54 am - +91 93484 29088: It's an multi label problem statement
10/10/2020, 1:55 am - +91 70218 21421: Why you are thinking about their revenue ..think about yourself ...your improvement..
10/10/2020, 1:55 am - +91 93484 29088: Just use some algorithm which supports multilabel problems
10/10/2020, 1:56 am - +91 93484 29088: Right!
10/10/2020, 1:56 am - +91 88008 73017: Was replying for discussion sake buddy.
I don't care about their revenue anyways

11/10/2020, 2:47 pm - +91 98205 01619: Yes
11/10/2020, 2:48 pm - +91 88008 73017: Isn't that certification ID i.e. ID of the course, and would remain same
11/10/2020, 2:48 pm - +91 98205 01619: Durgasoft also had today the seminar conducted by senior data scientist from Microsoft and GE
11/10/2020, 2:49 pm - +91 95101 07982: Seems illogical to me🤔
11/10/2020, 3:25 pm - +91 77278 58500: No. They there aren't the same thing as far as I know.
11/10/2020, 3:26 pm - +91 88008 73017: Then they are fake
11/10/2020, 3:27 pm - +91 77278 58500: TBH certificates like these don't matter much.
11/10/2020, 3:28 pm - +91 88008 73017: Not much, they actually don't matter at all in industry
11/10/2020, 3:29 pm - +91 77278 58500: Yes. Your skills. Or the certificate that you get from giving a real exam.
11/10/2020, 3:30 pm - +91 88008 73017: Even those doesn't matter
A lot of companies are even removing degree qualification criteria out of hiring, 
So the only thing matters are skills
11/10/2020, 3:31 pm - +91 77278 58500: They do. Like Azure certification and all, but I don't know that we have any in DS.
11/10/2020, 3:33 pm - +91 77278 58500: Or they cost a lot of money.
11/10/2020, 3:34 pm - +91 88008 73017: Azure is different, that's more like IT. Azure & AWS certification are very similar of SQL certification from Microsoft, which used to be very popular earlier
11/10/2020, 3:34 pm - +91 88008 73017: For DS, no ones cares for a certificate

11/10/2020, 4:33 pm - +91 95101 07982: What is idm+ ?
11/10/2020, 4:33 pm - +91 73966 05717: Applied AI is the best course in India for ML/DL and it is running by Srikanth Verma, an IISc graduated person. I have seen almost all his video lectures. He explains concepts very well and no one can match his indepth knowledge. 

Previously, they used to return paid amount if you haven't  placed😎.But assignments will be super tough with deep insights in it 🧐
11/10/2020, 4:34 pm - +91 93707 88208: is this the torrent or the one earlier

11/10/2020, 4:41 pm - +91 73966 05717: Because they will work 24/7 and it will be painful for them right. Think about what if anyone here starts any such kind of courses in future,maybe after few years. Just imagine how bad it is...! :(

11/10/2020, 4:58 pm - +91 70139 04382: It’s best to get a concept explained by as many experts as possible, in that way you will get good insight of the subject ( I mean if you cab afford), it’s not about being rich rather prioritise
11/10/2020, 4:58 pm - +91 70139 04382: *can afford

11/10/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 98858 15897: Please refrain from sharing any pirated content in the group. If it’s a open source of any material you’re free to do so.It’s a kind request not to share any content which is not meant to be distributed without any prior consent of that person/company. Recently ML minds similar to Applied AI and Ineuron has taken serious actions towards the people who all has done this. It will land you in trouble and also it’s not ethical to do so. Hope you guys understand 😊
11/10/2020, 6:21 pm - +91 86109 02042: 💯💯
11/10/2020, 6:28 pm - +91 96209 98263: Exact my point ..
11/10/2020, 6:39 pm - +91 77278 58500: 👍
11/10/2020, 7:23 pm - Nasik Sami: yes and first finish this one and if you are able, then see the related topic videos on youtube by different channels. It will help you to understand different perspectives of the topic. But better mainly stick to this one strictly and hopefully we all will be enough confident in this field after few months.
11/10/2020, 7:31 pm - +91 98489 13183: Yes well said
Stick to one course
11/10/2020, 7:31 pm - +91 98489 13183: Either ineuron or some other course
11/10/2020, 7:56 pm - +91 98858 15897: Totally agree..I have seen many sharing ebooks it’s good but only take it as a secondary resource like to refer to the topics which you gone through in Ineuron..Data Science is an ocean if you don’t stick to one plan and get yourself into different sources you will get more confusion than clarity. Remember too many cooks spoil the broth. I’m saying this out of experince Ineuron course structure is more than enough to get us equipped to become a Data Scienctist..Complete the course do projects and later if you feel there’s something missing you can refer other sources. Make smart use of your time and energy while learning don’t get deviated into other resources.

16/10/2020, 4:09 pm - +91 93484 29088: For micro you need to cal culate 1st precision micro and recall micro
Then calculate harmonic mean of these two
16/10/2020, 4:09 pm - +91 93484 29088: I know these things quiet confusing 😅
16/10/2020, 4:11 pm - +91 79721 94813: Yes  , I calculated  F1 score by average precision and avg recall value.this is right or wrong
16/10/2020, 4:13 pm - +91 93484 29088: Please show the code
16/10/2020, 4:14 pm - +91 79721 94813: For my understanding I just calculated manually
16/10/2020, 4:15 pm - +91 93484 29088: I don't understand what do you mean by avg precision that's why 😅
16/10/2020, 4:18 pm - +91 79721 94813: Each point A,B,C calculate precision and recall value then take average of precision & recall seperatly & calculate F1 score.

16/10/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 98394 23547: it shows image pixels
16/10/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 98394 23547: of example 1
16/10/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 98394 23547: 223 rd pixel
16/10/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 77278 58500: Values of RGB
16/10/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 77278 58500: As far as I guess
16/10/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 98394 23547: yes

16/10/2020, 7:49 pm - +91 98205 01619: I am working on Emergency vs Non Emergency classification
16/10/2020, 7:49 pm - +91 98205 01619: Using CNN now
16/10/2020, 7:50 pm - +91 98205 01619: Later with hyper parameter tuning I will do
16/10/2020, 7:50 pm - +91 98205 01619: And share the notebook along with blog - Guide to CNN
16/10/2020, 7:50 pm - +91 77278 58500: If the values are between 0 255 they are RGB
16/10/2020, 7:50 pm - +91 98394 23547: Any one know python Standard template library like cpp
16/10/2020, 7:51 pm - +91 98394 23547: ?
16/10/2020, 8:22 pm - +91 93484 29088: Basically you are dealing with batch of image this means 223 row's all pixel values (along 223 row's)
16/10/2020, 8:23 pm - +91 93484 29088: Of 1st image
17/10/2020, 12:11 am - +91 98489 13183: @919885437843 bro if u have any queries related to assignment or topics pls post your query here

Sorry if it hurts anyone
17/10/2020, 12:13 am - +91 98205 01619: In CNN in convolution layer the kernel size should be odd right (1,1), (3,3) , (5,5), (7,7) and filters must be 32/64/128/256/512/1024 right ?

In Maxpool2D the pool size should be even or what ? 

(2*2), (4,4), (6,6) ?
