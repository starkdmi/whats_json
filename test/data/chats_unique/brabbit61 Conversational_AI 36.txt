18/03/2019, 20:10 - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/ Ma'am,
I'm Jenit Jain, studying in my 3rd year of Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology.
I was intrigued by your company and I would love to be a part of your team.
I have been studying Artificial intelligence since my first year and haven't looked back. I have implemented several algorithms with success, have past experience working with LSTM and CNN models, did an internship where I was responsible for building models to solve problems related to computer vision and automating tasks by extracting information through data mining. I'm also working towards a minor in Intelligent Systems.
I would be obliged if I get an opportunity to work with your company and help build real life solutions.
Thank you.

I regret to inform you that I won't be able to participate in the internship.
I have realised that it will be more beneficial for me if I spend time practicing for my forthcoming placements that commence as soon as my semester starts.
I will always regret not being able to contribute to the cool 'iron man' things that you're building and I would like to apologise for the inconvenience.
I wish Dimension NXG all the successes in the future.

25/05/2019, 11:17 - Jenit Jain: https://forms.gle/jpB6yifYmDPiY253A
25/05/2019, 11:17 - Jenit Jain: This is the link we got with this
27/05/2019, 10:23 - Jenit Jain: Group dekh 😂
27/05/2019, 10:23 - Jenit Jain: Was getting tired of his Dubai trip
27/05/2019, 10:24 - Harshit Saxena: Hahaha
27/05/2019, 10:24 - Harshit Saxena: I know man
27/05/2019, 10:24 - Harshit Saxena: Tera last message dekha and I was like jenit ladega aaj Vidit se
27/05/2019, 10:24 - Harshit Saxena: 😂😂😂
27/05/2019, 10:25 - Jenit Jain: I was happy when kaustubh replied
27/05/2019, 10:25 - Jenit Jain: Ab nahi hoga
27/05/2019, 10:30 - Harshit Saxena: Ab bta
27/05/2019, 10:31 - Harshit Saxena: Vidit ne bada chada ke bola ya nahi?
27/05/2019, 10:31 - Harshit Saxena: 😂
27/05/2019, 10:43 - Jenit Jain: Let me read
27/05/2019, 10:46 - Jenit Jain: Man my timing is wrong every fucking time
27/05/2019, 10:46 - Jenit Jain: Yeh to achi story Nikli 😂
27/05/2019, 18:09 - Harshit Saxena: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13vOmV7dmxmwc6YtEbFXjyNhjdlpC-TXk?usp=sharing
27/05/2019, 18:15 - Jenit Jain: Checking wait
27/05/2019, 18:22 - Jenit Jain: so the dataset is basically just the description of the movie
27/05/2019, 18:22 - Jenit Jain: like if the genre is 1 then that movie is part of that genre
27/05/2019, 18:22 - Jenit Jain: vice versa
27/05/2019, 18:23 - Jenit Jain: and the prediction is whether the movie wwas a success or not
27/05/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: then the standard scalar function is used to normalise the dataset
27/05/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
27/05/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: we need to do this because the columns from G to L are not in the range from -1 to 1
27/05/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: we do this scalar normalisation because we dont want any one feature to affect the model more. like if the votes are in millions and the genre is just 0 or 1, change in the number of votes will affect the output more because it is such a big value so thats why you just normalize all features
27/05/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
27/05/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: clf = svm.SVC()
y_pred_Svm=clf.fit(X_train,Y_train).predict(X_test)
LogReg = LogisticRegression()
LogReg.fit(X_train, Y_train)
y_pred_Log = LogReg.predict(X_test)
27/05/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: this is basically creating 2 different models using the training set and getting the predictions on the test set
27/05/2019, 18:29 - Jenit Jain: confusion matrix in this case is a 2*2 matrix
27/05/2019, 18:29 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
27/05/2019, 18:30 - Jenit Jain: basically the principal diagonal elements should be as large ass possible and the other elements should be as less
27/05/2019, 18:30 - Jenit Jain: acc1 = accuracy_score(Y_test,y_pred_Svm)
acc2 = accuracy_score(Y_test,y_pred_Log)
27/05/2019, 18:30 - Jenit Jain: this is self explanatory
27/05/2019, 18:31 - Jenit Jain: precision and recall are 2 performance measures. I dont really understand the significance of either
27/05/2019, 18:31 - Jenit Jain: but f1 score is calculated as
27/05/2019, 18:31 - Jenit Jain: f1 = 2 * (p*r)/(p+r)
27/05/2019, 18:32 - Jenit Jain: higher f1 is better basicall
27/05/2019, 18:33 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
27/05/2019, 18:37 - Harshit Saxena: damn
27/05/2019, 18:37 - Harshit Saxena: need some time to understand all this
27/05/2019, 18:37 - Harshit Saxena: fuck
27/05/2019, 18:52 - Harshit Saxena: Ek baar laptop pe tum kar
27/05/2019, 18:52 - Harshit Saxena: Run kar*
27/05/2019, 18:53 - Harshit Saxena: And fir call kar please
27/05/2019, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: Arre Bata toh sahi Kya hua isme
27/05/2019, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: Mera internship ka run chal Raha hai isliye abhi nahi Kar sakta
27/05/2019, 18:53 - Harshit Saxena: <Media omitted>
27/05/2019, 18:53 - Harshit Saxena: Don’t understand these values
27/05/2019, 18:54 - Harshit Saxena: Also jab test file run karta hoon
27/05/2019, 18:54 - Harshit Saxena: Tab error ata hai
27/05/2019, 18:54 - Harshit Saxena: <Media omitted>
27/05/2019, 18:54 - Harshit Saxena: Free hoke raat mein call karliyo but please karliyo
27/05/2019, 18:54 - Harshit Saxena: Kal subh submission hai
27/05/2019, 18:55 - Jenit Jain: Accuracy is just number of wrong predictions
27/05/2019, 18:55 - Jenit Jain: Precision and recall ka formula dekh
27/05/2019, 18:57 - Jenit Jain: False positives are those instances where the model predicts the output as 1 (movie is successful) but actually the movie wasn't successful
27/05/2019, 18:57 - Jenit Jain: This is your 2 by 2 matrix that is printed
27/05/2019, 18:59 - Jenit Jain: So 162 movies which werent successful, the model also predicted it wasn't successful

27 movies that were successful, the model predicted they are successful

11 movies which weren't successful, model predicted that they were successful
27/05/2019, 19:00 - Jenit Jain: And accuracy = (162+27)/(162+27+11+10) = correctly predicted/all= 0.9
27/05/2019, 19:02 - Harshit Saxena: Prediction using SVM and Prediction using Logestic Regrrssion ka kya scene hai?
27/05/2019, 19:02 - Harshit Saxena: All the 0s and 1s
27/05/2019, 19:02 - Harshit Saxena: ..
27/05/2019, 19:03 - Harshit Saxena: Also what does actual mean in this?
27/05/2019, 19:04 - Harshit Saxena: Actual yes and Actual no
27/05/2019, 19:05 - Jenit Jain: Basically Jo test set mai instances hai, according to svm model all the movies were not successful, and according to logistic regression only the first 2 movies were successful. Number of elements in that prediction list is basically the number of elements in the test set X_test
27/05/2019, 19:07 - Jenit Jain: See the test set is part of the csv file for which we KNOW the output. So the given output is the Actual output, andthe predicted one is predicted by the svm/lr classifier given only the input
27/05/2019, 19:08 - Harshit Saxena: The total number of movies in the training csv is 1000
27/05/2019, 19:08 - Harshit Saxena: Yeh 13 kyun dikha rha hai?
27/05/2019, 19:09 - Harshit Saxena: Out of which total successful movies are 772
27/05/2019, 19:10 - Harshit Saxena: According to the csv file. Last column
27/05/2019, 19:11 - Jenit Jain: Nevermind, this is happening on check.csv
27/05/2019, 19:12 - Harshit Saxena: Ohhhhh
27/05/2019, 19:12 - Harshit Saxena: Got it
27/05/2019, 19:12 - Harshit Saxena: Got it
27/05/2019, 19:12 - Harshit Saxena: ❤❤❤❤
27/05/2019, 19:12 - Jenit Jain: why is this your lab proj
27/05/2019, 19:13 - Harshit Saxena: My lab instructor is chutiya guy who was very vague about the lab’s project requirements and shit
27/05/2019, 19:13 - Harshit Saxena: So I just asked one of the guy doing the lab with me to get someone else’s project
27/05/2019, 19:14 - Harshit Saxena: That they did last semester
27/05/2019, 19:14 - Harshit Saxena: Yeh banda akhand chutiya hai
27/05/2019, 19:14 - Harshit Saxena: Hello world ke aage koi program nahi samjh sakta
27/05/2019, 19:14 - Harshit Saxena: Issliye I’m trying to understand this
27/05/2019, 19:17 - Harshit Saxena: Also, why this difference in result
27/05/2019, 19:17 - Harshit Saxena: SVM model and Logistic se
27/05/2019, 19:17 - Harshit Saxena: Shouldn’t they predict the same thing?
27/05/2019, 19:18 - Jenit Jain: different approaches to detect. SVM basically forms a hyperplane in the n-dimension. so points on 1 side of the hyper plane are in 1 class and the other side are the other class
27/05/2019, 19:18 - Harshit Saxena: Acha

27/05/2019, 19:19 - Harshit Saxena: Last question
27/05/2019, 19:19 - Jenit Jain: logistic regression is more based on probability
27/05/2019, 19:19 - Harshit Saxena: Graph ka kya scene hai. How to interpret this
27/05/2019, 19:20 - Harshit Saxena: AUC graph mein accuracy hai? If so why is this 0.83 and neeche accuracy is 0.9
27/05/2019, 19:21 - Jenit Jain: bro just write the particular graph names on google. mujhe bhi interpretation and significance nahi pata
27/05/2019, 19:22 - Harshit Saxena: <Media omitted>

27/05/2019, 19:24 - Jenit Jain: see the 6th and 7th column in X
27/05/2019, 19:24 - Jenit Jain: its just drawing a graph between 2 random features
27/05/2019, 19:24 - Jenit Jain: delete that part because there is actually no interpretation for that
27/05/2019, 19:25 - Harshit Saxena: Okay

22/06/2019, 21:13 - Harshit Saxena: Haanji

22/06/2019, 21:14 - Harshit Saxena: Like sales, marketing etc
22/06/2019, 21:14 - Jenit Jain: And for the why these employees, draw various graphs of features so you can see
22/06/2019, 21:14 - Jenit Jain: Simple neural network use kar
22/06/2019, 21:14 - Harshit Saxena: And then which employee specifically is prone to leave

22/06/2019, 21:53 - Jenit Jain: For the other 2 draw graph using Python for each feature for both the classes and see what you find
22/06/2019, 21:54 - Jenit Jain: So like if some values (one column) is small for all values in which the employee will leave, then that is the trend
22/06/2019, 21:55 - Jenit Jain: Try to do that and see if you come to some conclusion if you dont see anything then tell I'm I'll think something different

04/07/2019, 19:12 - Harshit Saxena: This “break” is a very important for your relationship. Whatever happened last semester, whatever you did last semester, she needs to flush that out and this “break” should make her realise how much you mean to her.
04/07/2019, 19:13 - Harshit Saxena: I don’t know what else to say man.
04/07/2019, 19:14 - Harshit Saxena: You’ll just have to wait.

31/08/2019, 12:57 - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/ Ma'am,

My name is Jenit Jain, a final year student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, Karnataka, India. I'm currently pursuing a major in Computer Science and Engineering.

I have been exploring the field of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning since my first year of engineering. I have past experience of understanding and working with LSTM and CNN models. On completing my first internship at an Agri-Tech startup, where I was responsible for building models to solve computer vision domain problems and automating tasks by extracting information through data mining, I was confident that this the field I want to pursue in the future. My following internship was from the same domain at a large private company which helped me gain a lot of valuable experience.

I have also worked on numerous datasets found on Kaggle to develop my visualization skills. This has also helped me gain experience in many different types of preprocessing techniques in order to attain a well-structured input for any model.

I'm currently working towards a minor in Intelligent Systems.

I would be obliged if I get an opportunity to intern at your company for my final semester of engineering from January 2020- May 2020 and help build real-life solutions.

Thank you.

Your's Sincerely,
Jenit Jain.
