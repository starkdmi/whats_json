15/07/2018, 14:45 - Jenit Jain: sad
15/07/2018, 14:45 - Jenit Jain: Also do you know the drama that happened with nethraa and all?
15/07/2018, 14:46 - Harsha Tummala: No idea man, try asking divya
15/07/2018, 14:46 - Jenit Jain: no
15/07/2018, 14:46 - Jenit Jain: dont
15/07/2018, 14:46 - Jenit Jain: jesus
15/07/2018, 14:47 - Jenit Jain: since when are you trying to ask divya
15/07/2018, 14:47 - Harsha Tummala: I haven't, I just asked you to
15/07/2018, 14:48 - Harsha Tummala: I have no interest in poking into those matters
15/07/2018, 14:48 - Jenit Jain: Oh i knoe the drama
15/07/2018, 14:48 - Jenit Jain: lol
15/07/2018, 14:48 - Jenit Jain: i caused it
15/07/2018, 14:48 - Harsha Tummala: Then tell
15/07/2018, 14:48 - Harsha Tummala: XD
15/07/2018, 14:50 - Jenit Jain: In short, dikshita and i have been INDIRECTLY chucked out of the nethraa sriya and their group. Like nethraa and agrim are against us completely, divya and pranav are very neutral, and all the other girls are inclined to nethraa's side (by inclined i mean they probably dont give a shit about me which is fine but they still might talk to dikshita hopefully) and I also dont give 2 shits about parth and saurak.
15/07/2018, 14:51 - Harsha Tummala: Why is all this happening?
15/07/2018, 14:56 - Jenit Jain: Nethraa is a cocky (in general), tormenting (towards dikshita) and hypocritical (towards EVERYTHING) cunt who doesn't accept her mistake, and while i was trying to explain her everything and sort everything out she just couldn't understand jack shit and according to her nothing she did was wrong. And since she is kinda the *boss* of the group, no one else had the balls to confront her (eventhough most of them agreed about the above mentioned things till an extend). So after the discussion, which was useless, things went south. Agrim is her bf so obviously he'll be on her side, so saurak, nethraa and agrim left the whatsapp group and made another one with everyone from the old group except dikshita and i
15/07/2018, 15:00 - Harsha Tummala: Goddamn
15/07/2018, 15:00 - Harsha Tummala: Why would you want to confront her all of a sudden?
15/07/2018, 15:04 - Jenit Jain: I was hearing thing from months before that were just too shallow, and she was tormenting dikshita like crazy, like dikshita didn't even wanna room up with her for even 1 more month but dikshita is the complaining kind so she assumed that everything was fine. so dikshita dealt with her part, and i was trying to make her realise what she did (not related to dikshita) was very wrong and that she needed to apologise to the concerned people and also sort the stuff we had between us so that atleast we could still stay friends
15/07/2018, 15:12 - Jenit Jain: the point for all this gossip was, no i dont have any plans to go to some hill station or something the coming weekend )
15/07/2018, 15:13 - Jenit Jain: :)
15/07/2018, 15:14 - Harsha Tummala: Woah, I don't want to comment on anything. But just keep your ground
15/07/2018, 15:17 - Jenit Jain: keep your ground matlab
15/07/2018, 15:18 - Harsha Tummala: Stick to what you feel is right

23/04/2019, 00:00 - Harsha Tummala: ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
23/04/2019, 00:00 - Harsha Tummala: Thankssss
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Harsha Tummala: Dudeee
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Harsha Tummala: For stock turnover ratio
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Harsha Tummala: The numerator is cost of goods sold
23/04/2019, 00:01 - Harsha Tummala: It's not net sales
23/04/2019, 00:02 - Jenit Jain: To use cost of good you also need opening stock which isn't giving so that's why using net sales/ closing inventory
23/04/2019, 00:02 - Jenit Jain: CA has solved all this so just accept and decode. Notthing is wrong in this
23/04/2019, 00:02 - Jenit Jain: Except that you can add preference captial in shareholders equity
23/04/2019, 00:02 - Harsha Tummala: That is cool
23/04/2019, 00:03 - Harsha Tummala: But I mean, we are in a fix na....will the humanities guys accept it?
23/04/2019, 00:03 - Harsha Tummala: <Media omitted>
23/04/2019, 00:03 - Harsha Tummala: Tell me the cost of goods sold in this plis
23/04/2019, 00:03 - Jenit Jain: Refer to the formula sheet. It has the break up for all these formula
23/04/2019, 00:04 - Harsha Tummala: Just this one part
23/04/2019, 00:05 - Jenit Jain: Cash purchases?
23/04/2019, 00:05 - Harsha Tummala: Can we use sales/ closing inventory here also?
23/04/2019, 00:05 - Harsha Tummala: No idea what that is
23/04/2019, 00:05 - Jenit Jain: Yes
23/04/2019, 00:06 - Jenit Jain: It's given in the question
23/04/2019, 00:06 - Harsha Tummala: I think it's manufacturing expenses
23/04/2019, 00:07 - Harsha Tummala: Basically purchases
23/04/2019, 00:08 - Harsha Tummala: But the only problem is, if I do opening stocks in trade + purchases - closing stocks
23/04/2019, 00:09 - Harsha Tummala: It doesn't satisfy the part that says gross profit = net sales - cost of goods sold
23/04/2019, 00:12 - Jenit Jain: Cost of goods is 96000 + (138000-18000) - 144000
23/04/2019, 00:13 - Harsha Tummala: ye cool
23/04/2019, 00:13 - Harsha Tummala: what about this?
23/04/2019, 00:14 - Jenit Jain: So it might have made a loss?
23/04/2019, 00:14 - Harsha Tummala: could be
23/04/2019, 00:15 - Harsha Tummala: no idea
23/04/2019, 00:15 - Jenit Jain: No but it's written gross profit is 1.5L
23/04/2019, 00:15 - Harsha Tummala: and net sale is 1.5L - 6k
23/04/2019, 00:15 - Harsha Tummala: it is coming -ve that way
23/04/2019, 00:17 - Jenit Jain: No clue
23/04/2019, 00:19 - Harsha Tummala: dude
23/04/2019, 00:19 - Harsha Tummala: rate of gross profit/100
23/04/2019, 00:19 - Harsha Tummala: is the stock turnover ratio
23/04/2019, 00:20 - Jenit Jain: Is it a formula
23/04/2019, 00:22 - Harsha Tummala: no no
23/04/2019, 00:22 - Harsha Tummala: shit
23/04/2019, 00:22 - Harsha Tummala: (net sales - gross profit)/net sales = rate of gross profit
23/04/2019, 00:23 - Jenit Jain: Ohh gg
23/04/2019, 00:29 - Harsha Tummala: what is average inventories in this case
23/04/2019, 00:30 - Jenit Jain: (96000+144000)/2
23/04/2019, 00:30 - Harsha Tummala: shouldnt we add the cost of building also
23/04/2019, 00:30 - Jenit Jain: idküò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

23/10/2019, 10:34 - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/Madam,

My name is Jenit Jain, a final year student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, India. I'm currently pursuing a major in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Intelligent Systems. I am writing to you about the research assistant position in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Computer Science department for the upcoming semester.

I have been exploring the field of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning since my first year of engineering.  I have past experience of understanding and working with LSTM and CNN models. At my first internship, I was responsible for setting up the entire ML division at a startup from the ground up. I deployed CNN models, by implementing the network using Python Machine Learning framework: Keras, to analyse images that clients upload to the company website and give back critical information to the clients. i also worked on the extraction critical metrics from past data to come up with energy efficient solutions for their devices installed at the client sites. My following internship was at a large private company, where, I worked on a project that is an ongoing collaboration between the company and the government to implement the concept of Smart City. My minor, Intelligent Systems, has helped me gain valuable knowledge in the fields of AI, ML and NLP. My electives in the past also include Applied Linear Algebra and Software Testing. I work on datasets found on Kaggle frequently to develop my visualization skills and get hands-on experience with Python libraries like Numpy, SciPy, Pandas and Matplotlib to name a few. 
 
I would love to be considered for the position of Learning Engineer during my final semester of engineering from January 2020 - May 2020.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Jenit Jain.
