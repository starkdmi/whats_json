So All of you must be happy now as the Exams are over and vacations have started. But there is one thing that you need to Make sure ! It's regarding the Scholarships On Mahadbt portal. 
As we all know the last date to apply for it is *31/10/2019*.
So before this date make sure All eligible students apply for the scholarship.
Those who fails to apply has to pay *full open category fee* .
So just apply for Ur Eligible scheme today itself. 
If u face any problem  while doing it then let us know, we r there to help u.
Thank you!

26/06/20, 6:15 pm - Prakash R Nage Coep: टाळेबंदी च्या या काळात आपण सगळे आप आपल्या घरी आहात व पुढिल शैक्षणिक वर्ष २०२०-२१ ची वाट पाहत आहात. विद्यापीठ अनुदान आयोगाच्या जुन्या मार्गदर्शक तत्त्वानुसार साधारणपणे ऑगस्ट महिन्यात महाविद्यालय आनी शैक्षणिक सत्र सुरु होतिल. त्याचवेळी वेगवेगळ्या शिष्यवृत्ती आनी शैक्षणिक प्रवेशासाठी उत्पन्न प्रमाणपत्र/ वय अधिवास प्रमाणपत्र/ रहिवासी प्रमाणपत्र/ जात प्रमाणपत्र / जात वैधता प्रमाणपत्र / प्रगत आनी उन्नत गटात मोडत नसल्याचे प्रमाणपत्र ( Non-Cremy Layer) /आर्थिकदृष्ट्या मागास वर्ग (EWS) प्रमाणपत्र, अल्पभूधारक अथवा भुमीहीन प्रमाणपत्र याची गरज पडणार आहे.
सद्यस्थितीत प्रशासकीय पातळीवर तहसील कार्यालय नित्यनेमाने सुरु आहेत त्यामुळे नंतर होणारी गर्दी गोंधळ टाळण्यासाठी सध्याचा वेळ सत्कारणी लावून लागु असलेले प्रमाणात काढुन ठेवणे आपल्या हिताचे राहील.
साधारणपणे
*उत्पन्न प्रमाणपत्र हे दरवर्षी नवीन काढावे लागत असल्यामुळे हे सगळ्यांनीच काढावे.*
त्यांनतर प्रगत आनी उन्नत गटात मोडत नसल्याचे प्रमाणपत्र ( Non Creamy Layer) हे दर ३ वर्षांनी काढावे लागते. त्यामुळे आपल्या सध्या असलेल्या प्रमाणपत्रावरील वैधता बघुन जर ते मार्च २०२० ला अवैध झाले असेल तर नवीन काढुन घ्यावे.
आनी आर्थिकदृष्ट्या मागास प्रवर्ग (EWS) हे सुद्धा दरवर्षी नवीन काढावे लागत असल्यामुळे ते सुद्धा काढुन घ्यावे.

सुचना- जे लोक आर्थिकदृष्ट्या मागास प्रवर्ग (EWS) प्रमाणपत्र आनी प्रगत आनी उन्नत गटात मोडत नसल्याचे प्रमाणपत्र काढणार असतील त्यांनी उत्पन्न प्रमाणपत्र हे एक वर्षाचे न‌ काढता  ३ वर्षाचे काढावे. कारन वरील दोन्ही प्रमाणपत्रासाठी मागील ३ वर्ष उत्पन्न प्रमाणपत्र गरजेचं आहे.

साधारणपणे
१. उत्पन्न प्रमाणपत्र हे सगळ्यांनी काढावे.
२. प्रगत आनी उन्नत गटात मोडत नसल्याचे प्रमाणपत्र (Non Creamy Layer) हे SC & ST ही दोन प्रवर्ग *सोडून* जे इतर आरक्षच प्रवर्ग आहे त्यांना गरजेचं आहे त्यामधे OBC, VJ,
NT(1,2,3,4), SEBC,SBC हे आहेत.
३. आनी कुठल्याही आरक्षित प्रवर्गातील नसलेल्या पन दोन्ही पालकांचे  वार्षिक उत्पन्न ८ लक्ष पेक्षा कमी असलेल्या विद्यार्थ्यांना आर्थिकदृष्टया मागास प्रवर्ग (EWS) मधुन आरक्षण घेता येते त्यांनी ते प्रमाणपत्र काढून घ्यावे.
४. सामाजिक व शैक्षणिक दृष्ट्या मागास प्रवर्ग (SEBC) अर्थात मराठा आरक्षण हे फक्त महाराष्ट्र राज्यापर्यत सिमित असल्याने केंद्र शासनाकडे तसे आरक्षण नाही. त्यामुळे केंद्र शासनाकडील जागेसाठी या विद्यार्थ्यांनी आर्थिकदृष्ट्या मागास प्रवर्ग (EWS) हे प्रमाणपत्र काढुन त्यातुन आरक्षणाचा लाभ घ्यावा.
सदरील प्रमाणात देण्यात राज्यातील कोणत्याही तहसील कार्यालय तयार नसल्यास माझ्या नंबर वर संपर्क करावा त्याबद्दल चा शासन‌ निर्णय देण्यात येईल.


अडचन असल्यास संपर्क करावा.

आपलाच,

My parents have not received the monthly salaries

Hence, I request you to allow me to pay the fees in two installments on humanitarian grounds to enable me to pursue my studies further.

Kindly considers my case with a positive outlook and help me to study with a bruit further, I shall not disappoint you.

30/07/20, 9:03 am - +91 90281 88770: I think this is for those 
Who don't pay any amount from their side and their full fees is paid by respective scholarship giving authority.

And not for those who first pay fees and then get reimbursement from scholarship

मी mahadbt आनी maharashtra grivence redressal वर याची तक्रार केली होती तेव्हा मंत्रालयातील सचिव स्तरावरील अधिकारी यांचा हा नंबर
उद्या स. ११ ते ५ मधे यांना फोन करून बोला. जेव्हढे जास्त फोन तेवढा दबदबा.
फक्त अप्लीकेशन आयडी आनी इतर तपशील सोबत असु द्या.
कोणी एकानी फोन केला तर काम होईल या अपेक्षेने राहु नका.  ज्याच्या त्याच्या आयडी वर काम होईल..
