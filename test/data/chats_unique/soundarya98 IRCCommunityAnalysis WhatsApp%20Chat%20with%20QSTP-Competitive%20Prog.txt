25/04/19, 04:30 - +91 99202 61900: The course will introduce students to some core competitive programming concepts and relevant data structures and algorithms will be taught with an emphasis on problems. This will not introduce them to topics that are asked in coding tests and interviews conducted by companies during placements and internships. The focus on problems solving will help the student develop programming skills in C++, Python and Java. Each topic will have an extensive list of problems to solve and relevant editorials will also be uploaded.
25/04/19, 04:31 - +91 99202 61900: The desc u uploaded....Pls modify and send here by afternoon....

22/05/19, 17:54 - Samarth Jain: Hello everyone, and welcome to the *QSTP - Competitive Coding*. This course will provide a good introduction to this field for the beginners, and for everyone sitting for *placements / internships* the coming season, you'll be well-versed with the concepts with a lot of practice and be prepared, after the course ends.

The main focus of this course will be for us to give you all a strong hold on the basics, and we'll focus on a *lot of problem solving*, by having assignments, tutorial sheets and coding tests. Every week, there will be *2 topics* we'll be putting up, including tutorials/slides for the same, and giving you a lot of practice questions and assignments. Every 2 weeks, we'll have a *Coding test* 2-3 hours long, to regularly test what is learnt, and how much is grasped. 

The only *pre-requisite* for this course is *basic syntax* of any fundamental programming language you're comfortable in - C, C++, Java or Python. Basic syntax includes only basic knowledge of the code, variables, declaring *arrays* and knowing syntax of how to *write and call functions*. 

*If you every have any doubts in these, it's perfectly fine, feel free to ask and we'll be more than glad to help!*
22/05/19, 17:55 - Samarth Jain: Let's begin by introducing the *Course instructors* and *Course TAs* i.e. volunteers. 

Firstly, we have *Sarthak Agrawal* (@919818533389 ), who is one of the finest coders from our batch (2016), and has experience with C++, Python, Django, Java and many more. He's currently interning with CommonLounge this summer. 

Next, we have *Rishabh Khincha* (@917888013992 ), who is again a dualite in our batch and is currently in Canada this Summer pursuing a project under Mitacs Globalink Research Internship. He's one of the smartest people I know, and btw, he scored a perfect 10 SGPA in his first semester of CS Courses (LCS, DD, DISCO, OOP)

Last course instructor will be me, *Samarth Jain*. I was introduced to Competitive Coding in my school, and have mainly been doing it regularly since my 1-2. I've also been the Algomaniax coordinator for the last 2 years and right now, I'm interning with Uber this summer.

We also have *Arshdeep, Mayank and Pravin* who are volunteer TAs for this QSTP course and will be helping all of us with the course material and we all together will always be here to help you with your doubts, and to debug your codes üòÅ All three of the TAs are currently undergoing their PS-1 industry experience in CEERI Pilani, CRIS Delhi and VoiceQube, respectively.
22/05/19, 17:56 - +91 88057 11581: I don't know C++... I know only python..that won't be a downside right
22/05/19, 17:57 - +91 98888 02206: can u share the handout for the course?
22/05/19, 17:59 - Samarth Jain: Definitely not! The questions are all language-independent, and you can pursue the course in any language you're comfortable in.

Python, although perfectly fine and acceptable, has one drawback (not a limitation, only a drawback), that is slow. 5 times slower than C++ and Java, due to which very rarely you might get a timeout error. Mostly you won't, and algorithms which pass in C++/Java should pass in Python as well - Online judges take care of that
22/05/19, 17:59 - +91 88057 11581: Ok thanks!
22/05/19, 18:00 - Samarth Jain: We'll share that soon, probably by tonight.
22/05/19, 18:05 - +91 98888 02206: üëç
22/05/19, 18:50 - +91 81306 86865: Are we gonna be using hackerrank?
22/05/19, 18:59 - Samarth Jain: Yes, all of you are required to create Hackerrank accounts with your 13 digit BITS ID as the username/handle (ex: 2018A7PS0001G)
22/05/19, 19:00 - +91 88057 11581: What if we are not from bits
22/05/19, 19:02 - Samarth Jain: If you're from outside BITS, you can use your own ID. We'll float a doc soon, asking for your hackerrank handles.

For BITSians as well, the 13-digit ID isn't compulsory, but is advisable as you'll anyways be needing those IDs in your future courses
22/05/19, 19:03 - +91 96893 41271: How many hours/week is recommended for doing this course?
22/05/19, 19:03 - +91 99261 77722: I have my Hackerrank account already and some progress in it already,  is it alright?
22/05/19, 19:04 - +91 77678 78935: +1
22/05/19, 19:04 - Samarth Jain: Nothing very specific, but the more time you devote, the more practice you'll get, and in this field, more practice equals better strength and understanding. 

We'd suggest atleast finish the tutorial sheets we upload, each week. *And definitely definitely take part in all contests, we organise*.

The contests will also be used to evaluate you all for Certificates of Excellence
22/05/19, 19:05 - Samarth Jain: Sure sure, feel free to use them. Just mention them against your name once we float the doc.
22/05/19, 19:26 - +91 97654 20585: if i dont have inclination towards any language which language is recommended to start with?
22/05/19, 19:29 - Sarthak: I'd say C++. C++ is fast and has a well defined standard library called STL too. You could also go with Java. Although python is easier to code, it's slow and sometimes the contests/companies don't account for that in the time limits.
22/05/19, 19:29 - +91 98292 02950: From where should I learn c++ syntax and basics
22/05/19, 19:32 - +91 70886 72137: Search C++ tutorials on google
W3schools karke there's a website
22/05/19, 19:34 - Sarthak: If you prefer videos and would not mind fast pace teaching, then you can try Derek Banas's videos on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas
22/05/19, 19:36 - Sarthak: I suggest that you just learn the basics of C++ syntax and not spend a lot of time on it. You can learn as you go and you'd have a much better understand.

22/05/19, 20:29 - Rishab Khincha: No, you will not require any concepts from OOP
22/05/19, 20:33 - +91 90110 98005: But we expect to learn In This course,right?
22/05/19, 20:34 - +91 70886 72137: I guess this course is DSA only right?
22/05/19, 20:38 - Rishab Khincha: We will not be focusing on OOP in this course, it's going to be just DSA

22/05/19, 20:54 - Sarthak: Yes. For competitive programming, DSA is useful
22/05/19, 20:55 - +91 97178 99330: Kab se start hoga course
22/05/19, 20:55 - +91 97178 99330: ?
22/05/19, 21:01 - Sarthak: We'll start with algorithmic complexity and efficiency shortly. Till then, everyone can revise their C++ syntax. Also, for those who code in C, I highly suggest you shift to C++. The transition is not that hard and plenty of useful features are there in C++. You'll always get much better resources online.
22/05/19, 22:00 - +91 95524 89767: Are the semester exams over for BITS students?

24/05/19, 00:03 - +91 97654 20585: we should learn c++ on windows or on Ubuntu?
24/05/19, 00:08 - +91 80807 74681: Where should we learn dynamic memory allocation from??
24/05/19, 00:11 - Samarth Jain: The Operating System doesn't matter for the language, it'll work the same way everywhere. 

Although I suggest you use Ubuntu while coding, as it has some advantages like terminal support and file input output is made much much easier.
24/05/19, 00:13 - Samarth Jain: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-and-delete-operators-in-cpp-for-dynamic-memory/ is a good resource for the same. 
Although you won't ever be needing dynamic allocation of memory when it comes to Competitive programming
24/05/19, 00:13 - +91 80807 74681: Ok thanx
24/05/19, 00:14 - Samarth Jain: Even if you need an array which grows in size as the program progresses, we have pre-defined data structures for the same, under Standard Template Library(STL) - the second topic we'll be covering

24/05/19, 13:23 - +91 70886 72137: What is the purpose of malloc() ?
I mean, memory gets allocated when we declare an element anyways. ..
So in which cases malloc() is to be used to create memory?
24/05/19, 13:29 - +91 98401 39371: It is used in dynamic programming. In general memory is allocated before program execution but when u don't know how much memory/array size is needed we use this and allocate memory during program execution.
24/05/19, 13:31 - +91 70886 72137: But for changing size don't we use realloc() ?
24/05/19, 13:34 - +91 98401 39371: Malloc is to allocate memory initially. Then the size can be changed with realloc
24/05/19, 13:34 - +91 90697 90308: Malloc is used when you allocate memory for first time and realloc if you want change the size of previously allocated memory.
24/05/19, 13:35 - +91 97178 99330: Better to use new operator
24/05/19, 13:36 - +91 90697 90308: Yup if you're comfortable with cpp
24/05/19, 15:11 - +91 70886 72137: No. 
My doubt was why do we need to allocate memory using malloc (for example creating the temp pointer in link list) 
While declaring a variable isn't memory alloted then and there?
24/05/19, 15:13 - +91 83607 58691: Using malloc it is allocated during run time. For instance temp variable would‚Äôve been declared in some function which we may or may not call. If we do call it, it will allocate memory then hence saving space required. I guess.
24/05/19, 15:25 - +91 95524 89767: To understand better what was explained above, consider 2 concepts: Array and Linked List

In an array, you declare the size of array (no. of blocks of memory you'll be occupying) in _advance_. This means that the compiler already knows it has to keep so and so memory aside for array in advance. This memory cannot be modified once the program starts running (i.e. cannot be changed during run-time). You can only change the memory before you run the program (i.e. during compile-time a.k.a. *statically*)

In a linked list, the block of memory has two parts, data part and link part. Data part is used to store data, and link part is used to store link to the next memory block.

This memory block is called *_nodes_*, in linked list.

In a linked list, you can keep creating new "nodes" and link them (i.e. Adding new node to current linked list) or deleting the nodes _while_ the program is running (i.e. At run-time a.k.a. Dynamically).

Hence we use malloc(), since we don't know the actual size of list during run-time, it can vary as the program proceeds. So in order to allocate memory while the program is _running_, we use the special function called malloc(). Without it, we can't allocate memory during run-time and will have to exit program to keep allocating/de-allocating memory, which is inefficient.

Got it
24/05/19, 15:29 - +91 95524 89767: No problem at all, glad it helped üòÑ‚úå
24/05/19, 15:47 - +91 74711 12711: If you are using a function, the memory allotted to a variable will be freed as soon as the function ends and the data with the variable is lost forever. 

For the same, malloc is used. Dynamically allocated memory needs to be freed manually and so can be accessed even after function ends.
24/05/19, 16:10 - +91 70886 72137: Ok thanks
24/05/19, 20:34 - +91 6354 405 152: When will the course start?

26/05/19, 13:07 - +91 93701 93941: Can the answers to the problems be shared in the next week's lecture slides so that we can check our solutions?
26/05/19, 23:29 - Sarthak: Sure, we'll do it.
26/05/19, 23:38 - +91 93701 93941: Thanks!
26/05/19, 23:39 - Sarthak: How is the progress going on this? By the end of it, you should be able to understand the need to find the big-O complexity of an algorithm. You should also be able to figure out the big-O complexity of any function(Let's say, n^2 + 2^n + n! ), and the the constraints on N for a given complexity(N^2 algorithm can work for about N <= 10^4).
26/05/19, 23:45 - Sarthak: A couple of thorough quizzes on the same: https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/af47067f239147a4ab3393cecfbecadc

27/05/19, 11:11 - +91 70886 72137: Does the headerfile bits/stdc++.h make the program slower ? (C++)
27/05/19, 11:13 - +91 85180 76044: Yes it does make program slow, using it would include a lot of unnecessary stuff and increases compilation time.
27/05/19, 11:13 - Samarth Jain: It does increase the compile time of the program, so when you run it on your pc it might take a little longer to compile, but it has no effect on the runtime. 

Submitting codes with bits/stdc++.h on online judges won't have any problem, because they only count the runtime, not the compile time
27/05/19, 11:14 - +91 70886 72137: Ok.
So it won't increase the chances of getting a TLE right?
27/05/19, 11:15 - Samarth Jain: Right. Using that header file will not have any role in a TLE
27/05/19, 11:16 - +91 70886 72137: Ok thanks
27/05/19, 11:17 - +91 70886 72137: Also, 
Does using printf/scanf instead of cin/cout make the run time faster ?
27/05/19, 11:18 - Samarth Jain: Yes, that has a very significant increase in speed of the program. CIN and COUT are very slow as compared to PRINTF and SCANF. Preferably, avoid cin and cout when your input and output is large ( > 10^6 )
27/05/19, 11:20 - Samarth Jain: Either you can use printf / scanf directly, or you can make cin and cout work at the speeds of scanf and printf, by writing these 3 lines as the first 3 lines of main:

```ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);
cout.tie(0);```
27/05/19, 11:20 - +91 70886 72137: Woah
Thanks for telling this. 
Heading over to GFG to learn more about this üòÇ
28/05/19, 08:38 - Sarthak: We hope that you've completed the time complexity topic by now. Incase if you cover the resources ahead of us, you can practice the A ladder of codeforces available on A2oj(https://a2oj.com/ladder?ID=4 ). This will make your implementation strong and will be highly beneficial towards the later stages. Feel free to post any doubts about the same here.
28/05/19, 08:50 - +91 98292 02950: What is Username and password for this
28/05/19, 08:51 - Sarthak: You'll have to create accounts on both codeforces and a2oj.
28/05/19, 09:16 - +91 70886 72137: Using bits id?
28/05/19, 09:29 - Sarthak: Anything works. Whatever is convenient for you.
28/05/19, 16:43 - +91 98292 02950: Does accessing array element also affect run time of code?
28/05/19, 16:53 - Sarthak: Each and every operation does take time. You need not worry about it though. It's an O(1) operation
28/05/19, 16:54 - +91 98292 02950: Ok
28/05/19, 16:57 - +91 74711 12711: What does it mean when we declare an array without it's size or initialisation?
Ex-> int arr[ ];
28/05/19, 17:00 - +91 91317 89215: Doesn't thay give error? Inless you initialise values?
28/05/19, 17:00 - +91 74711 12711: In a few programs, it didn't give any. I actually forgot to write the size but it still worked.
28/05/19, 17:03 - +91 98292 02950: So in sum=sum+A[i]
would count as 2 steps right?
28/05/19, 17:11 - +91 91317 89215: It takes 2 steps but is still O(1). In competetive we worry about time complexity (the big O notation) and not the number of steps
28/05/19, 17:12 - +91 98292 02950: Ok thanks

I am not able to handle the case in which both max and min come side by side and swapping them only counts to one
28/05/19, 20:02 - +91 88057 11581: Can you tell me the input if it's not too long
28/05/19, 20:02 - +91 88057 11581: Acha ok got your query
28/05/19, 20:03 - +91 88057 11581: Find min elements highest index....and max elements lowest index
28/05/19, 20:04 - +91 88057 11581: If former is lower than latter then subtract 1
28/05/19, 20:04 - +91 88057 11581: Else you don't...
28/05/19, 20:04 - +91 88057 11581: Higher

  cin.tie(0);
  cout.tie(0);
29/05/19, 23:31 - +91 97736 03024: on using this inside the main statement , it interferes with the order in which cout statements are displayed on the terminal
29/05/19, 23:31 - +91 97736 03024: it asks me the size and the elements of the array after i have already entered them
29/05/19, 23:32 - +91 97736 03024: replacing cout with printf("enter size") however resolves the issue
29/05/19, 23:33 - +91 97736 03024: is their something we need to know bout these three lines that might create problems?
29/05/19, 23:45 - Sarthak: Share your code through p.ip.fi

30/05/19, 00:00 - +91 97736 03024: I mean...not letting cout output strings ?
30/05/19, 00:03 - +91 91317 89215: these statements help you speed up your program when whole input is already given
30/05/19, 00:04 - +91 91317 89215: This is interactive way to get input and produce output onevery step.
30/05/19, 00:06 - +91 91317 89215: In a few competitive rounds you get some interactive problems where we need to flush the output at every step.
30/05/19, 00:07 - +91 91317 89215: Except these problems the 3 lines work everywhere
30/05/19, 00:07 - +91 97736 03024: Oh..now i get it

31/05/19, 18:20 - Sarthak: We hope that by now you would be familiar with the syntax of the language of your choice. Moving forward, we are sharing the resources on searching on arrays as well as greedy algorithms. 
Go through the slides attached for searching and do attempt the questions included in them.
For greedy algorithms, the two resources in the doc shared cover the topic extensively. Greedy algorithm will require adequate practice from your side and we hope that you do them enthusiastically.

31/05/19, 18:21 - Sarthak: We would also be hosting the first coding round, *QSTP CodeRound - 1*, on *8th June, Saturday* which will test your knowledge and implementation skills on all the topics that have been covered till now. We hope to see an active participation from your side!
31/05/19, 19:58 - +91 88604 18506: When we'll get the answers of the examples of time complexity ?
31/05/19, 20:05 - +91 90697 90308: When's the deadline to complete it?
31/05/19, 20:07 - +91 97178 99330: This message was deleted
31/05/19, 20:08 - Sarthak: There is no deadline. You can stop doing Ladder A when you feel that your implementation skills have improved. Also note the time taken for you to finish each problem. If you're able to submit the solution consistently in under about 10-15 minutes, then I would say you should move on to solving ladder B.
31/05/19, 20:08 - Samarth Jain: Answers to the questions of Time Complexity:

Q1. O(n^2)
Q2. O(n) (notice the semicolon after the first loop)
Q3. O(m*n)
Q4. O(logN) (in coding terms, whenever we say logN, it is generally to the base 2, not 10)
Q5. T times
Q6. T-1 times
Q7. Best case: O(1), Worst case O(n)
Q8. Best case O(1), worst case O(n^2) (the best case will be when choice is neither 1 nor 2)
Q9. O(n)
Q10. O(n)
Q11: O(n)
Q12: O(2^n)
Q13: O(n)
Q14: O(logN)
31/05/19, 20:09 - +91 90697 90308: Okay
31/05/19, 21:27 - +91 90110 98005: Can anyone please explain how we got anwser of ex.12?
31/05/19, 21:29 - +91 90697 90308: If you draw the recurrence tree then you'll get a GP with a=1 and common ratio = 2 and applying sum of GP formula will give you 2^n.
31/05/19, 21:57 - +91 90110 98005: Can u please show me example how to draw recurrence tree?
31/05/19, 23:34 - +91 70886 72137: On YouTube search for the channel 'Abdul Bari'. He has a playlist by the name Algorithms. His videos are very nice.

01/06/19, 17:25 - +91 70886 72137: Created an array c of size n and initialized all to 1
Also an array of size n called flag and intialized all to 0
Traversed left to right and if a[i] <a[i+1] then
c[i+1] = c[i+1] + c[i];
flag[i+1]= 0;
Then traversed from right to left and if the next is greater than the current and flag ==0 then increased its value the same way as above
01/06/19, 17:25 - +91 70886 72137: A = arr (the given vector)

02/06/19, 00:00 - +91 70233 79384: \0 is a null and understand that string ends here

08/06/19, 10:44 - Sarthak: The Long challenge has begun for the month of June on Codechef. You have 10 days to solve 7 problems. The current one ends on 17th of June. You would participate in the Division 2. There is no penalty for wrong submissions and you can take as much time as you want to figure out the solution, even google some concepts you may think are relevant. Through a long challenge, you learn a lot as you have enough time to think and learn. Do participate in the contest and let us know if you face any problems during it. I would advise you that you avoid asking for hints and solutions, because then you won't be giving your 100% towards your own improvement. Do ask your doubts related to the problems and your codes on the group once the contest ends. All the best!

08/06/19, 21:40 - +91 6387 311 722: ?
08/06/19, 21:40 - Samarth Jain: You can assume all ai are less than 1e8

08/06/19, 22:06 - +91 79751 99044: <Media omitted>
08/06/19, 22:08 - Samarth Jain: The entire problem is of 100 points. For 90 points (known as a subtask), N and Q are between 1 and 100, and for remaining 10 points, they are between 1 and 10^5.

The goal of subtasks is to help you think a smaller version of the problem. If you write code for the bigger constraints, it'll automatically pass for the smaller ones as well (provided it is correct). 

However, if you aren't able to write code for the bigger subtask, you can attempt the smaller subproblem as well
08/06/19, 22:10 - +91 94300 60285: In "Chemistry Lab", when I tried "Run Code" I got correct result in TestCase 0 and 1 but when I submitted, it is showing wrong answer in TestCase 0.

08/06/19, 22:13 - +91 91317 89215: The sample testcases are not the testcase 0 and 1. They are shuffled.
08/06/19, 22:14 - +91 91317 89215: Don't worry about that. Correct code would fetch 100
08/06/19, 22:14 - +91 94300 60285: Ok
08/06/19, 22:42 - +91 77678 78935: I dint understand the 2nd qs. Especially the term, "Tweaked". Can someone pls explain
08/06/19, 22:44 - +91 70176 55105: it means changed, for the second test case, we need to change two numbers for the correct ans, that is 17 to a number less than 10 and 19 to 10
08/06/19, 22:44 - +91 77678 78935: Ohh,ok
Thanks
08/06/19, 22:44 - +91 74711 12711: changed the language by mistake and unable to change it back to C. What to do?
08/06/19, 22:45 - +91 79751 99044: If the input is not within the constraints do we ask for another input or just break out of the program?
08/06/19, 22:46 - +91 6387 311 722: its always within the constraints
08/06/19, 22:46 - +91 79751 99044: Okk
08/06/19, 22:46 - +91 6387 311 722: no need to check
08/06/19, 22:46 - Samarth Jain: You don't need to worry for this. It won't ever happen. 

The test case setters take care that variable values are within constraints
08/06/19, 22:46 - +91 74711 12711: anyone?
08/06/19, 22:47 - Samarth Jain: Try Shift-Reloading the page
08/06/19, 23:58 - +91 74540 97458: In that question for which we had to take N numbers and Q queries and return index if it exists else return -1

I did it with binary search (both recursive and iterative) but wasn't getting answer from it
I did it from linear search but got 90 points. How is that happening?
08/06/19, 23:58 - +91 74711 12711: Same
08/06/19, 23:59 - Samarth Jain: The array isn't necessarily sorted. Binary search works only with sorted arrays
08/06/19, 23:59 - +91 88057 11581: so we can discuss solutions?
09/06/19, 00:01 - +91 88057 11581: i used dictionary...so even faster than binary search
09/06/19, 00:05 - +91 97736 03024: Had the same problem
09/06/19, 00:05 - +91 97736 03024: When you sort the array....the elements are sorted and allotted new indices
09/06/19, 00:05 - +91 97736 03024: So now you cant print their original indices from this new sorted array...hence thr error
09/06/19, 00:06 - +91 88057 11581: <Media omitted>
09/06/19, 00:06 - +91 88057 11581: its find ab subsequences problem...why i am getting runtime error in this? all other cases are fine
09/06/19, 00:06 - +91 88057 11581: this
09/06/19, 00:07 - +91 90697 90308: Can anyone please tell the approach to solve "diversity and inclusion" and "as high as possible" problems?
09/06/19, 00:07 - +91 74540 97458: I sorted it first.
09/06/19, 00:10 - +91 88057 11581: Ok ... input was blank...and here goes my chance of perfect score due to a silly reasonüôÅ
09/06/19, 00:10 - +91 74540 97458: Ohh.. yeah 
Thanks
09/06/19, 00:10 - +91 88057 11581: but seriously, how do we handle blank input?
09/06/19, 10:17 - +91 97736 03024: * not any question discussion with regards to getting stuck on a  june long challenge question
09/06/19, 10:18 - +91 97736 03024: doubt:-ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
09/06/19, 10:18 - +91 97736 03024: because of these three lines , it was showing runtime(SIGSEGV) on my code
09/06/19, 10:19 - +91 97736 03024: removing them , gave an AC....what is the problem occuring here?
09/06/19, 10:19 - +91 97736 03024: chef and proxy question
09/06/19, 12:15 - +91 99097 12908: +1
09/06/19, 12:20 - +91 79751 99044: +1
09/06/19, 14:13 - +91 90697 90308: I have solved "as high as possible problem" you have to sort the array of strings based on the following rule:
Given two strings a and b.
Create two strings temp1 = a+b and temp2=b+a.
Now calculate the score given by temp1 and temp2.
If temp1>temp2 then a>b
Else b>a.

Sort the whole array of strings in same way and then calculate the score for the sorted array that'll be the answer.
09/06/19, 14:17 - +91 88057 11581: Another simple way. Given string x, calculate num=x.count('a')/x.count('b') now sort all string sort them according to their number values (ie sort [..(num,x)..]) then join the strings in that order and finally find number of abs
09/06/19, 14:21 - +91 90697 90308: What if string has no 'b'?
09/06/19, 14:22 - +91 88057 11581: The num=infinty
09/06/19, 14:22 - +91 88057 11581: Then
09/06/19, 14:24 - +91 83788 04341: you would get the same number value for 'aaab' and 'baaa', how would you sort between the two?
09/06/19, 14:25 - +91 88057 11581: Yeah then it makes no difference
09/06/19, 14:25 - +91 88057 11581: Like in @919069790308 s solution, temp1=temp2
09/06/19, 14:34 - +91 97736 03024: I didn't get the question tbh
09/06/19, 14:34 - +91 97736 03024: Is the max length of the string 10?
09/06/19, 14:46 - +91 88057 11581: Max length of each of given strings is 10
09/06/19, 14:46 - +91 88057 11581: Together after concatenation they might give a very big string
09/06/19, 14:46 - +91 97736 03024: Ohh..cool
10/06/19, 12:57 - +91 91317 89215: Hello everyone i have uploaded editorial for the problem chemistry lab of coderound1. Let me know if you have any doubt
10/06/19, 14:14 - +91 90697 90308: Please upload for Diversity and Inclusion
10/06/19, 14:47 - +91 91317 89215: Its binary search na. What doubt do you have?
10/06/19, 15:28 - +91 90697 90308: No that was Et tu Brute i think
10/06/19, 15:28 - Samarth Jain: Diversity and Inclusion is Binary Searching Over the Answer. I'll put the editorial soon
10/06/19, 15:29 - +91 90697 90308: Okay
10/06/19, 15:30 - +91 90697 90308: Got itüëç
11/06/19, 06:30 - +91 99969 41700: Can i approximate,,  2^7 to 10^2
11/06/19, 06:30 - +91 99969 41700: For constraints
11/06/19, 06:30 - +91 99969 41700: ?
11/06/19, 08:01 - Samarth Jain: Approximate 2^10 to 10^3, that is a more widely used and accepted convention
11/06/19, 08:01 - +91 99969 41700: Ohh,, thanks,,
11/06/19, 09:29 - +91 99969 41700: <Media omitted>
11/06/19, 09:29 - +91 99969 41700: Modulo*
11/06/19, 09:37 - +91 74540 97458: This message was deleted
11/06/19, 10:30 - Samarth Jain: So what happens is, *pow* function returns a float variable. Float*10 is also a float, so the RHS tries to do a float variable modulo an integer, which isn't possible. (Modulo works only with integer-based types - int, long long)
11/06/19, 10:30 - Samarth Jain: To rectify, you'll have to maintain your bracket as an integer
11/06/19, 10:30 - +91 99969 41700: So if i use int* outside the bracket,,  will it work?
11/06/19, 10:31 - +91 99969 41700: I mean if i typecast float to int
11/06/19, 10:33 - Samarth Jain: For this, there are 3 options - 

1. Explicitely typecast pow result to int using (int)pow(2, k-1)... This is not recommended as there will be precision loss (floats are stored differently)
2. Write your own pow function (you can use modular exponentiation to do this in logN)
3. If you want to do 2^x specifically, it is best you use the binary shift operator ( 1 << (k-1) ) which does 2^(k-1) very fast and safely.
11/06/19, 10:34 - +91 99969 41700: I tried 1 and 2 ,, didn't work for me,,  i think i should try 3rd one also
11/06/19, 10:34 - +91 99969 41700: Thanks üî•üî•
11/06/19, 10:35 - Samarth Jain: It would've overflowed, if you got a wrong answer.
11/06/19, 10:36 - Samarth Jain: 2^64 is the maximum you can go. 2^65 will overflow even the limits of long long int
11/06/19, 10:36 - +91 99969 41700: Yeah,,  i knew the reason,,  that's why tried different methods,,  but didn't work,,  i hope the 3rd one works
11/06/19, 10:37 - Samarth Jain: The third one will also overflow if k > 65
11/06/19, 10:37 - +91 99969 41700: Yesh, that's why i need to find the modulus before storing jt
11/06/19, 10:37 - Samarth Jain: Read about "Modular Exponentiation" to tackle this issue :)
11/06/19, 10:38 - +91 99969 41700: Ohkk ohkk,,  just doing it
11/06/19, 10:38 - +91 99969 41700: Thanku so much
12/06/19, 04:07 - +91 99969 41700: This message was deleted
12/06/19, 12:15 - +91 97736 03024: what is the time complexity of pow function in c/c++
12/06/19, 12:15 - +91 97736 03024: is it efficient like the stl in c++
12/06/19, 12:18 - Samarth Jain: The complexity is logN but the coefficient is high. Generally it is suggested you write your own pow function, as it provides much more flexibility for use
12/06/19, 12:19 - Samarth Jain: Yes it is efficient (runs in log(exponent) ) but it is very restricted in the sense you cannot do modulo or other operations, and also it returns a float instead of int, which leads to incorrect results most of the time
12/06/19, 12:29 - +91 97736 03024: So i should simply write a power function with long long int return value
12/06/19, 12:29 - +91 97736 03024: I can then do modulo on it as well
12/06/19, 12:34 - Samarth Jain: Right!
12/06/19, 12:36 - +91 97736 03024: thanks :)
12/06/19, 13:19 - +91 70176 55105: Do different hackerrank problems have different run time limit?
12/06/19, 13:19 - +91 70176 55105: Is it given somewhere
12/06/19, 13:19 - +91 70176 55105: Is it not 1 sec always?
12/06/19, 13:34 - Sarthak: The question-setter change the time-limits, depending on the constant factor of the time complexity
12/06/19, 13:35 - +91 70176 55105: So, how do we get to know that?
12/06/19, 13:36 - +91 70176 55105: Coz there was a problem with 1<=n<=100 and i gave a solution with O(n^2) which gave TLE
12/06/19, 13:39 - Sarthak: That's 1e4, should take about less than 0.001s. Time constraints are never this tight. Share your code and the link to the question and we can have a look at it. In general, the time limits vary from 1s-4s.
12/06/19, 13:41 - +91 70176 55105: I will have to find it. Actually, after the TLE, i wrote an alternate solution and it worked.
12/06/19, 13:42 - Sarthak: Alright
12/06/19, 13:43 - +91 70176 55105: i think it was the picking numbers problem on hackerrank

18/06/19, 22:19 - +91 97736 03024: how to go about in the above problem
18/06/19, 22:35 - +91 99969 41700: I have a n square approach,,   in which you first sort the array,,  and you start from start and the end,, this way you get two elements whose sum is less than k
18/06/19, 22:35 - +91 99969 41700: Then you loop between those two elements similarly,,  starting from the beginning to the end,,  to get the remaining sum
18/06/19, 22:36 - +91 99969 41700: This way you can get all possible combinations
18/06/19, 22:37 - +91 99969 41700: If someone has better approach,,  plz tell,,
18/06/19, 22:37 - +91 97736 03024: Yes..thanks
18/06/19, 22:38 - +91 97736 03024: It seems like a good approach
18/06/19, 22:38 - +91 97736 03024: Plus the constraints are highly favoured for O(n^2)
18/06/19, 22:38 - +91 99969 41700: Yooo
18/06/19, 22:38 - +91 99969 41700: Yes,,  you can go up to n^3
18/06/19, 22:39 - +91 99969 41700: But we're going for n^2
18/06/19, 22:50 - +91 91672 46263: Are you allowed to take the same element twice?
18/06/19, 22:50 - +91 97736 03024: No
18/06/19, 22:51 - +91 91672 46263: Can you explain N^2 in detail?
18/06/19, 22:53 - +91 6354 405 152: This group is completely useless
18/06/19, 22:54 - +91 6354 405 152: U guys are teaching nothing
18/06/19, 22:54 - +91 91672 46263: Cauz when you are looping across the same elements to get the remaining sum, i think you can get the elements already taken
18/06/19, 22:54 - +91 6354 405 152: Just random doubt discussion is going on
18/06/19, 22:54 - +91 6354 405 152: I was completely wrong of thinking that i would actually learn something here
18/06/19, 22:57 - +91 99969 41700: Then you just need one if condition,,  coz the elements are sorted,,  so all the similar elements will be together,,  so just take where,,  a(i)  is not equal to a(i-1)
18/06/19, 22:57 - +91 99969 41700: That's it
18/06/19, 22:58 - +91 91672 46263: Can you code it up?
18/06/19, 22:58 - +91 99969 41700: Bro just practice from any site,,  you'll learn,,
18/06/19, 22:59 - +91 99969 41700: Now?
18/06/19, 23:00 - +91 91672 46263: Not urgent
18/06/19, 23:00 - +91 99969 41700: I'll be at home in few minutes,,  then I'll give it a try
18/06/19, 23:04 - +91 99969 41700: Bro i just searched the Google
18/06/19, 23:04 - +91 99969 41700: And there is the solution of same ans,, and they are using kind of same approach,,
18/06/19, 23:04 - +91 99969 41700: But,,  the complexity is n^3,
18/06/19, 23:04 - +91 91672 46263: Yeah n3 is easy
18/06/19, 23:05 - +91 99969 41700: No,,  i mean,,  the same approach i used is of n^3
18/06/19, 23:05 - +91 99969 41700: They are using the same
18/06/19, 23:05 - +91 99969 41700: And this can't be solved in n^2
18/06/19, 23:06 - +91 99969 41700: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-four-numbers-with-sum-equal-to-given-sum/

18/06/19, 23:06 - +91 91672 46263: Oh cool then I thought you have a n^2 approach
18/06/19, 23:07 - +91 91672 46263: N^3 is easy
18/06/19, 23:07 - +91 99969 41700: Yeah,,  just by thinking even i thought it could be done in n^2

18/06/19, 23:12 - +91 99969 41700: We actually can do it in n^2,,  as i thought
18/06/19, 23:15 - +91 97736 03024: lol...its a new concept all together XD
18/06/19, 23:16 - +91 91672 46263: It's a famous one..they have just reduced it from n2 logn of binary search to n2 using hashmap
18/06/19, 23:16 - +91 91672 46263: Nice one though!
18/06/19, 23:16 - +91 99969 41700: Yeahh,,  üî• it's really great method

25/07/19, 21:59 - +91 88057 11581: Will an O(n‚àön) algorithm work for n<=150000
25/07/19, 22:00 - +91 91672 46263: Can work, depending on how heavy the operations are
25/07/19, 22:01 - +91 88057 11581: Top of that I code in python
25/07/19, 22:01 - +91 88057 11581: I am unsure whether to code or not
25/07/19, 22:02 - +91 91672 46263: Then you cant be sureüòÖ
25/07/19, 22:03 - +91 97736 03024: Which algo are trying to use
25/07/19, 22:03 - +91 88057 11581: I have to factorize all numbers from 1 to n
25/07/19, 22:04 - +91 88057 11581: Number of factors
25/07/19, 22:04 - +91 91672 46263: Use sieve of Eratosthenes
25/07/19, 22:04 - +91 97736 03024: +1
25/07/19, 22:04 - +91 88057 11581: Oh sorry not number of factors
25/07/19, 22:05 - +91 88057 11581: I have to find every factor
25/07/19, 22:05 - +91 97736 03024: Create a sieve array outside the testcases input loop
25/07/19, 22:05 - +91 97736 03024: Then extract the primes from it
25/07/19, 22:05 - +91 88057 11581: Ok then?
25/07/19, 22:06 - +91 97736 03024: O(nlog(log(n)))
25/07/19, 22:06 - +91 97736 03024: +
25/07/19, 22:06 - +91 88057 11581: How to find every factor
25/07/19, 22:07 - +91 91672 46263: You can reduce it to nlogn using sieve
25/07/19, 22:08 - +91 88057 11581: Yeah but how to factor using that
25/07/19, 22:11 - +91 91672 46263: You want all the factors or just prime factors?
25/07/19, 22:12 - +91 88057 11581: All factors
25/07/19, 22:13 - +91 88057 11581: Not prime ones
25/07/19, 22:13 - +91 88057 11581: I mean all divisors
25/07/19, 22:13 - +91 88057 11581: I can't see better that O(‚àön)
25/07/19, 22:13 - +91 88057 11581: Than
25/07/19, 22:20 - +91 97736 03024: let me try and see
25/07/19, 22:27 - +91 97736 03024: a rather shady doubt , but should the number itself and 1 be considered in the answer?
25/07/19, 22:27 - +91 88057 11581: Yes
25/07/19, 22:41 - +91 97736 03024: code.re/grl
25/07/19, 22:44 - +91 97736 03024: Hope this helps
25/07/19, 22:45 - +91 88057 11581: Thanks a lot for thatüòÑ
25/07/19, 22:45 - +91 97736 03024: üòä
25/07/19, 22:45 - +91 88057 11581: But aren't some numbers getting counted more than rwice
25/07/19, 22:45 - +91 88057 11581: Twice
25/07/19, 22:45 - +91 88057 11581: Like you first go through multiples of 2, then 3 then 5 etc right
25/07/19, 22:46 - +91 88057 11581: So 6 will be counted twice?
25/07/19, 22:46 - +91 97736 03024: Yes..and broke the loop as soon as the multiple reached...or became larger than the number we are checking for
25/07/19, 22:46 - +91 97736 03024: Yes..true
25/07/19, 22:47 - +91 91672 46263: Just write a simple sieve instead of going till sqrt(n) go till n
25/07/19, 22:47 - +91 97736 03024: But still the complexity for large values of n is way lesser than if you checked..for each number...from,  1 to that number
25/07/19, 22:48 - +91 88057 11581: Ok so the complexity is O(nloglogn) right
25/07/19, 22:48 - +91 91672 46263: Where you do prime[j]=1
Instead of that do a push back in a vector
25/07/19, 22:48 - +91 88057 11581: To factorize n
25/07/19, 22:48 - +91 88057 11581: But this is bad
25/07/19, 22:48 - +91 97736 03024: For seive...as far as i remember
25/07/19, 22:49 - +91 88057 11581: No see..
25/07/19, 22:49 - +91 97736 03024: Yup...did that only
25/07/19, 22:49 - +91 88057 11581: It's n/2+n/3+n/5 etc right
25/07/19, 22:49 - +91 88057 11581: This is nloglogn
25/07/19, 22:49 - +91 91672 46263: Might be more than this as here we will remove the condition of running the inner for loop only when it its prime
25/07/19, 22:49 - +91 91672 46263: But will be bounded by nlogn for sure
25/07/19, 22:50 - +91 97736 03024: Lol..CS F111
25/07/19, 22:50 - +91 91672 46263: But more than this
25/07/19, 22:50 - +91 97736 03024: Overall code, definitely
25/07/19, 22:50 - +91 88057 11581: No what I mean is
25/07/19, 22:50 - +91 91672 46263: Nloglogn is when you do the inside loop only for primes
25/07/19, 22:50 - +91 88057 11581: What's the complexity to find factors of n given the sieve
25/07/19, 22:51 - +91 91672 46263: Now you are doing for non primes also, so should be nlog(n)
25/07/19, 22:51 - +91 88057 11581: .
25/07/19, 22:52 - +91 91672 46263: Nlog(n)
25/07/19, 22:52 - +91 88057 11581: This is bad right
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 88057 11581: We already  have ‚àön
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 97736 03024: Nlogn is pretty goodüòÖ
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 97736 03024: I dont think root n is possible
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 91672 46263: This is for all the n numbers
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 91672 46263: +1
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 97736 03024: You'll have to travel the n numbers atleast once
25/07/19, 22:53 - +91 88057 11581: Oh I see
25/07/19, 22:55 - +91 88057 11581: Wait you have said this
25/07/19, 22:55 - +91 88057 11581: When a multiple of y us not factor of x, further multiples won't be
25/07/19, 22:56 - +91 88057 11581: this is false?..or am I reading it wrong
25/07/19, 22:56 - +91 88057 11581: Bcoz 2*3 doesn't divide 10
25/07/19, 22:56 - +91 88057 11581: But 2*5 does
25/07/19, 23:19 - +91 97736 03024: yes..that was a logical error
25/07/19, 23:19 - +91 97736 03024: plus for some numbers multiples values like 1 2 2 4 were getting printed
25/07/19, 23:19 - +91 97736 03024: and for 45 ; 15 was not getting printed

25/07/19, 23:20 - +91 97736 03024: this is the revised one( i have used sets in this instead of vector for sorted output)
