06/10/2018, 13:21 - Jenit Jain: Won't that be putting too much pressure on her
06/10/2018, 13:22 - Rishab Srivastva: But you seem too disturbed with that. So if you tell her that keeping all that has been disturbing you so much then she will understand.
06/10/2018, 13:23 - Jenit Jain: So what exactly should I tell her
06/10/2018, 13:24 - Rishab Srivastva: Tell her that you're relationship hasn't been upto the mark and you think you could give it a shot with her.
But make sure she doesn't feel like she is the reason why your relationship isn't working out.
06/10/2018, 13:24 - Rishab Srivastva: And ask how her relationship is right now.
06/10/2018, 13:25 - Jenit Jain: She said she's happy with Sid and doesn't want to fuck it up

13/10/2018, 21:24 - Rishab Srivastva: Dude fu... Not happening
13/10/2018, 21:25 - Rishab Srivastva: I asked her then also if Jenit knows about this and she said no and she doesn't want you to know it as well
13/10/2018, 21:25 - Rishab Srivastva: That's why I never said anything
13/10/2018, 21:25 - Jenit Jain: That's when you tell

13/10/2018, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: I won't confront obviously
13/10/2018, 21:26 - Rishab Srivastva: It probably won't happen. She already feels bad for putting me through this.
13/10/2018, 21:26 - Jenit Jain: What did she say
13/10/2018, 21:27 - Jenit Jain: Did she say something after everything got sorted
13/10/2018, 21:27 - Rishab Srivastva: You don't need to know that. That's between me and her.
13/10/2018, 21:27 - Jenit Jain: Bollll
13/10/2018, 21:27 - Rishab Srivastva: Not much. I asked her if she is fine and all. That's all

13/10/2018, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Fbhenskxjcne
13/10/2018, 21:31 - Rishab Srivastva: Don't be a kid
13/10/2018, 21:31 - Rishab Srivastva: Fap and sleep off
13/10/2018, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Bolde
13/10/2018, 21:31 - Rishab Srivastva: Bhai tere se realted bhi nahi hain

13/10/2018, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Say
13/10/2018, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: I'm not gonna tell her man
13/10/2018, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: If I start over thinking the BI notes won't be made
13/10/2018, 21:32 - Rishab Srivastva: It's only 6 and 7 na btw?
13/10/2018, 21:33 - Jenit Jain: Yes
13/10/2018, 21:34 - Rishab Srivastva: She feels bad about the entire thing and the way it turned out. She doesn't want to loose either one of us and she doesn't wanna risk her relationship as well.
13/10/2018, 21:34 - Rishab Srivastva: Ugly position
13/10/2018, 21:35 - Jenit Jain: I told her that instead of keeping things out of mind. Rather acknowledge it and accept it and move on
13/10/2018, 21:35 - Jenit Jain: Kya bole
13/10/2018, 21:35 - Jenit Jain: Let's try to keep it normal now
13/10/2018, 21:35 - Jenit Jain: Apne aap theek hogi
13/10/2018, 21:35 - Rishab Srivastva: Wah kya advice di hi lund guru
13/10/2018, 21:35 - Jenit Jain: It's good
14/10/2018, 10:34 - Jenit Jain: What did tanvi say about Arusha btw
14/10/2018, 10:38 - Rishab Srivastva: <Media omitted>
14/10/2018, 10:38 - Rishab Srivastva: Plus she trusts me anyday.
14/10/2018, 10:41 - Jenit Jain: So basically with Arusha is it just like a guy thing?
14/10/2018, 10:41 - Jenit Jain: Like just hookup kind of thing
14/10/2018, 10:51 - Rishab Srivastva: Nothing bro
14/10/2018, 10:52 - Jenit Jain: Tell man
14/10/2018, 10:52 - Rishab Srivastva: It's not.
14/10/2018, 10:52 - Jenit Jain: Then it's proper like like thing?
14/10/2018, 10:54 - Rishab Srivastva: No dude. She is a good friend I guess. I don't wanna screw up. Plus it's not fair to Tanvi if I start dating or seeing someone right away.
14/10/2018, 10:58 - Jenit Jain: All that aside
14/10/2018, 10:58 - Jenit Jain: Dimaag Mai Kya hai
14/10/2018, 10:59 - Jenit Jain: I'm asking all this because when I told somiya about my thing at the start, I very subtly told her that it was just a physical thing for me. I think she missed that.
14/10/2018, 10:59 - Jenit Jain: I don't think even you knew
14/10/2018, 10:59 - Rishab Srivastva: I didn't
14/10/2018, 11:01 - Jenit Jain: Same for you?
14/10/2018, 11:19 - Jenit Jain: .
14/10/2018, 11:19 - Rishab Srivastva: Idk
14/10/2018, 11:20 - Rishab Srivastva: Zada kuch nahi hain
14/10/2018, 11:20 - Rishab Srivastva: It's already going now
14/10/2018, 11:22 - Jenit Jain: How's it with tanvi
14/10/2018, 11:23 - Rishab Srivastva: What with Tanvi?

18/11/2018, 13:17 - Rishab Srivastva: Ya... She really doesn't seem to be letting things go this sem at least.
18/11/2018, 13:20 - Jenit Jain: It's fine. It's not like I'm trying
18/11/2018, 13:21 - Jenit Jain: Mere kaam ho raha hai. Kafi hai mereliye
19/11/2018, 04:30 - Rishab Srivastva: How to prove that a barrel shifter has that exact number of extra links compared to mesh network!
19/11/2018, 04:33 - Rishab Srivastva: This message was deleted
19/11/2018, 06:36 - Jenit Jain: I don't know where they got the 2^n-1 from
19/11/2018, 06:37 - Jenit Jain: Each node is connected to 2n-1-4 more links than mesh
19/11/2018, 06:37 - Jenit Jain: So that's how you get 2n-5
19/11/2018, 06:38 - Jenit Jain: And 2^n-1 = N/2
19/11/2018, 06:39 - Jenit Jain: Still don't understand this
19/11/2018, 06:39 - Rishab Srivastva: Do we need to know things like dirty line copyback, cache line fill?
Uske bina bhi toh bana sakte hain na state transition diagram
19/11/2018, 06:39 - Jenit Jain: Dude I didn't understand the state diagram only.

19/11/2018, 06:40 - Rishab Srivastva: Lmao diagram easy hi hain
19/11/2018, 10:56 - Rishab Srivastva: <Media omitted>
19/11/2018, 11:08 - Jenit Jain: 2A?
19/11/2018, 11:08 - Rishab Srivastva: Haan
19/11/2018, 11:08 - Rishab Srivastva: Maam ne karwaya tha
19/11/2018, 11:09 - Rishab Srivastva: Why do you neglect only a few links and keep other links even when it's not satisfying the conditions in the question statement
19/11/2018, 11:10 - Jenit Jain: Because question is framed that way
19/11/2018, 11:10 - Jenit Jain: You are considering only subset of connections because of the question
19/11/2018, 11:10 - Jenit Jain: Because it's written that even goes to the next even
19/11/2018, 11:10 - Jenit Jain: And odd goes to whatever it is connected to
19/11/2018, 11:11 - Jenit Jain: So from 1 it will go to 2 and 3
19/11/2018, 11:11 - Jenit Jain: And from 2 it will go to only 4
19/11/2018, 11:11 - Jenit Jain: Not 3 even though it is connected
19/11/2018, 11:11 - Rishab Srivastva: It's written odd goes to next successor stage
19/11/2018, 11:12 - Jenit Jain: Successor=whatever it is connected to
19/11/2018, 11:12 - Jenit Jain: Even successor = whatever even stage it is connected to
19/11/2018, 11:12 - Rishab Srivastva: So why is 1 going to 3?
19/11/2018, 11:13 - Rishab Srivastva: ?
19/11/2018, 11:14 - Rishab Srivastva: That's what it means?
19/11/2018, 11:17 - Jenit Jain: Yes
19/11/2018, 11:18 - Rishab Srivastva: Kaisa chutiya language hain

03/12/2018, 18:30 - Rishab Srivastva: No dude honestly she needed a reason to be pissed I think. Country inn thing was a bigger thing than Nupur. Yet she was like the Nupur thing bothers her more.
03/12/2018, 18:31 - Rishab Srivastva: Things are sorted between Arusha and me. I want to ask you if I should talk to Parv again.

21/12/2018, 13:43 - Rishab Srivastva: virtualenv something
21/12/2018, 13:43 - Jenit Jain: But for what
21/12/2018, 13:45 - Rishab Srivastva: Creating the virtual environment for running tensorflow
21/12/2018, 13:46 - Jenit Jain: You mean a tensorflow session?
21/12/2018, 13:46 - Jenit Jain: Are you trying to run a code or install
21/12/2018, 13:46 - Rishab Srivastva: No.
21/12/2018, 13:46 - Rishab Srivastva: Code :/

22/12/2018, 12:25 - Jenit Jain: You got the virtualenv thing
22/12/2018, 12:31 - Rishab Srivastva: Yep
22/12/2018, 12:32 - Rishab Srivastva: So you source the main tf code into your current wd. That creates a virtualenv and then u can import tensorflow in it.
22/12/2018, 12:34 - Jenit Jain: Elaborate
22/12/2018, 12:35 - Rishab Srivastva: So basically after you create the virtualenv,
You'll have (tensorflow) written at the start of each terminal line
22/12/2018, 12:40 - Rishab Srivastva: Your bin in tensorflow folder contains an executable activate file. When you source it, you create a virtual environment where you can use tensorflow
22/12/2018, 12:40 - Rishab Srivastva: For example
22/12/2018, 12:40 - Rishab Srivastva: In any working directory typr
22/12/2018, 12:41 - Rishab Srivastva: source /home/jenit/tensorflow/bin/activate
22/12/2018, 12:41 - Rishab Srivastva: And tf will be activated in that wd
22/12/2018, 12:42 - Jenit Jain: Acha han
22/12/2018, 12:42 - Jenit Jain: What do you do after creating the virtualenv tho
