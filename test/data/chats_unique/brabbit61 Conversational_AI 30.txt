21/08/2018, 00:56 - Divya Manjunath: üôÑüòë
21/08/2018, 00:56 - Divya Manjunath: Pretty sick
21/08/2018, 00:57 - Divya Manjunath: And im sorry to say, I was vvv disappointed with her that day
21/08/2018, 00:57 - Jenit Jain: Stay over?
21/08/2018, 00:57 - Divya Manjunath: Idk if it's because of all this or what, but she also has changed or god knows what
21/08/2018, 00:58 - Jenit Jain: I feel she is going into a shell
21/08/2018, 00:58 - Divya Manjunath: Atleast talk to the people u want to na
21/08/2018, 00:58 - Divya Manjunath: Like wtf
21/08/2018, 00:58 - Divya Manjunath: I was dam cut up that day
21/08/2018, 00:58 - Divya Manjunath: So I just stopped trying
21/08/2018, 00:59 - Jenit Jain: She feels like everyone is taking nethraas side and all which might not be true so she is distancing herself from everyone
21/08/2018, 00:59 - Divya Manjunath: Shell definitely have her own side to it, and obviously ull have to believe her.. but as a third person I feel it's not fair
21/08/2018, 01:00 - Divya Manjunath: To judge everyone based on a situation which others haven't been victim to
21/08/2018, 01:01 - Divya Manjunath: Dude common. What is this side business idk. We bloody can't just stop talking. She is a good friend to us and hasn't done anything to us. We can't just stop hanging out with her just because some 3rd person doesn't like her
21/08/2018, 01:02 - Divya Manjunath: And it's not like sriya and upach also don't talk to Dik, they do very very properly
21/08/2018, 01:02 - Divya Manjunath: Dikshita makes her self feel like an outsider when nethraa is there by not taking part in the convo
like whose telling u to talk to nethraa. There are three other people in the conversation
21/08/2018, 01:04 - Divya Manjunath: Yeah like I really felt I wud have done better on my own, but courtesy sakes and the fact that she's a good friend, I din say anything
21/08/2018, 01:06 - Jenit Jain: I agree to each and every point you just said
21/08/2018, 01:06 - Divya Manjunath: Can u please tell me , I really want to know
21/08/2018, 01:06 - Jenit Jain: I shouted at her also rn
21/08/2018, 01:06 - Jenit Jain: Just rn
21/08/2018, 01:07 - Jenit Jain: I told her I'm not even going to listen to her vent because she's being stupid
21/08/2018, 01:07 - Jenit Jain: Whatever you said that only
21/08/2018, 01:07 - Jenit Jain: That assuming she's not wanted and all
21/08/2018, 01:08 - Divya Manjunath: Ugh , its a mental block
21/08/2018, 01:08 - Divya Manjunath: She has to be strong man
21/08/2018, 01:08 - Divya Manjunath: And
21/08/2018, 01:08 - Divya Manjunath: What did she tell u about the stay over
21/08/2018, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: I told her all these things now only
21/08/2018, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: She said that day she just didn't feel like talking
21/08/2018, 01:09 - Divya Manjunath: Some 5 minutes she stayed and she assumes all this
21/08/2018, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: Nothing else
21/08/2018, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: It's being going for a while
21/08/2018, 01:09 - Divya Manjunath: Yea she shudnt have come up then. Simply spoilt my mood also
21/08/2018, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: And y'all were talking about the trips and photo shoot and all that she want invited (she thinks) so yeah
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Jenit Jain: I knowüôà
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Divya Manjunath: Never have i missed sriya  so much
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Divya Manjunath: Fucking if u need to play pubjee u can do that downstairs
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Divya Manjunath: And I was legit trying to study also that day but she was playing
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Jenit Jain: Just understand that she's thoda on the edge rn and take her shit for a bit
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Jenit Jain: I know
21/08/2018, 01:10 - Divya Manjunath: I really got dam pissed
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: And I just went to sleep
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: And then next morning
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Jenit Jain: Understandable
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: I asked her for lunch
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: She said no
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Jenit Jain: I'm trying my best to talk sense to her
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: I was like fine I'll go and come and I thought shell stay till I come
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: And then when I came back
21/08/2018, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: Bloody she din even shut my door and she had left
21/08/2018, 01:12 - Divya Manjunath: Again got pissed
21/08/2018, 01:13 - Divya Manjunath: Gosh that photo shoot was something sriya n upach did and trip was just some future plans man
21/08/2018, 01:13 - Divya Manjunath: And if she isn't even here half the time
21/08/2018, 01:13 - Divya Manjunath: How doesn't she expect herself to get included in the topics of discussion
21/08/2018, 01:13 - Divya Manjunath: Like 8am-11pm ur in class and pp
21/08/2018, 01:14 - Divya Manjunath: Suddenly u come up for 5 mins
21/08/2018, 01:14 - Divya Manjunath: And u expect things to make sense? Any person would be lost
21/08/2018, 01:14 - Jenit Jain: You've never made more sense.
21/08/2018, 01:15 - Jenit Jain: It's just that rn I'm telling her that it's not just her, others are also getting affected. And that she needs to talk to you properly to figure out whatever is going on
21/08/2018, 01:15 - Divya Manjunath: And she's not that type of person wholl intrude and ask what's happening, so definitely she won't understand shit
21/08/2018, 01:16 - Jenit Jain: She's saying that she's never been in so much social drama so she doesnt know how to deal with it. Such nonsense so even I got pissed
21/08/2018, 01:17 - Divya Manjunath: I don't see anyone getting affected, bcoz tbh nothing is going on. Whatever is going on is going on in her head
21/08/2018, 01:19 - Divya Manjunath: Atleast I'm not going to go all the way to ask her n all. If she wants to speak or whatever I'm always there. I've tried my bit and if she still feels the same way I really can't do anything . And for whatever reasons I'm not going to stop talking to nethraa for such trivial reasons. And if that stands as a criteria  for her being friends with others, then ultimately it's just you, jenit, for her
21/08/2018, 01:23 - Divya Manjunath: After the stay over day, I've realized I can't do anything. She was way too insensitive ( don't know if it's the right word) and it actually really infuriated me. And I've stopped trying from that day
21/08/2018, 01:25 - Jenit Jain: Don't blame you. I just shouted at her and I'm done with her cribbing until she decides to do something about it. Only with you. Idc for any friendships except yours and her's rn
21/08/2018, 01:25 - Jenit Jain: And ya, don't try
21/08/2018, 01:25 - Divya Manjunath: Previous day also I asked her for waffles n all,and some bullshit she said..but ultimately I took her with me thinking I've not spent time with her. But it was all in vain. Some formality friendship I don't want to have
21/08/2018, 01:25 - Jenit Jain: If you're important enough she'll come to you
21/08/2018, 01:25 - Jenit Jain: Okay it's not formality. Dw. It's just that she is in a messed up place
21/08/2018, 01:26 - Jenit Jain: Her fault
21/08/2018, 01:26 - Jenit Jain: Just give her time. Nothing else.
21/08/2018, 01:26 - Divya Manjunath: Please help her with it
Your the only one she's taking to rn
21/08/2018, 01:27 - Jenit Jain: Yes
21/08/2018, 01:27 - Divya Manjunath: And if need be you can send her this convo. Doesn't bother me
21/08/2018, 01:27 - Divya Manjunath: Even if I come off as rude or not understanding her situation, doesn't matter
21/08/2018, 01:27 - Divya Manjunath: It's legit the truth
21/08/2018, 01:36 - Jenit Jain: She said she'll talk to you tomorrow because RN her head is hurting or whatever other excuse she has. Just wait it out.
21/08/2018, 01:36 - Divya Manjunath: I hope you chilled in Goa and din bother urself with this bullshit
21/08/2018, 01:37 - Divya Manjunath: ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
21/08/2018, 01:45 - Jenit Jain: Delete this message, I'll let you know samnese if she isn't willing to do anything. You deserve to know that. Then you can do anything and it will be valid
21/08/2018, 01:45 - Jenit Jain: Mat bolo aisa üôà
21/08/2018, 01:45 - Divya Manjunath: Which message

21/08/2018, 01:48 - Jenit Jain: Daruu
21/08/2018, 01:48 - Divya Manjunath: Do u realize, if she doesn't do anything, she'll legit have no one other than u and maybe her kshtij
21/08/2018, 01:49 - Divya Manjunath: That guy also seems shady, but whatever their good friends
21/08/2018, 01:49 - Jenit Jain: I have already told her everything you told me tonight before you told me. And she's getting pissed that I'm forcing her to do all this but i don't feel bad because it's necessary. She knows that only she can handle it now
21/08/2018, 01:50 - Jenit Jain: First half ++
21/08/2018, 01:50 - Divya Manjunath: üòÇüòÇ

21/08/2018, 19:36 - Jenit Jain: You didn't tell me anything about the crying
21/08/2018, 19:36 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita was unconsciously a dick
21/08/2018, 19:36 - Divya Manjunath: Lol
21/08/2018, 19:36 - Divya Manjunath: But yea then
21/08/2018, 19:36 - Divya Manjunath: I told her whatever I told h

21/08/2018, 19:37 - Jenit Jain: Hehe

21/08/2018, 19:41 - Divya Manjunath: But I told her clearly that she Shud never expect that all of us stop talking to nethraa n all
21/08/2018, 19:41 - Divya Manjunath: So she says she understood
21/08/2018, 19:41 - Divya Manjunath: Hopefully she did
03/09/2018, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: Please don't ditch her for dinner
03/09/2018, 20:09 - Divya Manjunath: Dude

04/09/2018, 00:24 - Divya Manjunath: We all told nethraa
04/09/2018, 00:24 - Divya Manjunath: That what agrim did was wrong
04/09/2018, 00:24 - Divya Manjunath: And even she agrees
04/09/2018, 07:36 - Jenit Jain: Great
04/09/2018, 11:26 - Divya Manjunath: Just went and chilled with dik
04/09/2018, 11:26 - Divya Manjunath: Everything is fine ü§üüèª
04/09/2018, 12:33 - Jenit Jain: You won't have to put up with us, and vice versa
04/09/2018, 12:33 - Jenit Jain: Whatever happened yesterday could've been conveyed to you in a much better way, and my intention wasn't to hurt you. I just think that you and jenit made it very evident that you didn't want to be friends with us after the drama last sem so I think it's for the best if instead of awkwardness and need for fakeness, we just accept that we're all unrelated now
04/09/2018, 12:33 - Jenit Jain: If you felt bad about what I did yesterday, I'm sorry for not handling it better. I didn't know parth had called you over. Hope you can understand that I'm only doing this to put an end to any unnecessary drama that would've happened over time
04/09/2018, 12:34 - Jenit Jain: Agrim sent dikshita this
04/09/2018, 12:35 - Jenit Jain: Why is he saying 'us' except nethraa dikshita is talking to everyone.
04/09/2018, 12:35 - Jenit Jain: I didn't even step inside 414
04/09/2018, 12:37 - Divya Manjunath: I think us means neths and agrim
04/09/2018, 12:37 - Divya Manjunath: Atleast he apologized
04/09/2018, 12:37 - Jenit Jain: Doesnt matter honestly
04/09/2018, 12:37 - Jenit Jain: He is no one to tell anyone to fuck off
04/09/2018, 12:38 - Jenit Jain: When except 2 people everyone was fine with dikshita
04/09/2018, 12:38 - Jenit Jain: This is how dikshkta and I get treated when we try to do something right. What to do now

06/09/2018, 10:27 - Divya Manjunath: Everyone is pissed at agrim for doing what he did
06/09/2018, 10:27 - Divya Manjunath: Their respect has gone a little down
06/09/2018, 10:28 - Divya Manjunath: And whoever they see him they'll all remember what he did to dik
06/09/2018, 10:28 - Divya Manjunath: *whenever

06/05/2019, 10:43 - Divya Manjunath: ....
06/05/2019, 10:43 - Divya Manjunath: Both of you aren't going to be fine
06/05/2019, 10:43 - Divya Manjunath: Just act a little sensibly, and talk it out
06/05/2019, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: I suggest you stay out
06/05/2019, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: We are going to talk after paper
06/05/2019, 10:46 - Jenit Jain: But I'm not budging so
06/05/2019, 11:15 - Divya Manjunath: I wish I could
06/05/2019, 11:15 - Divya Manjunath: But it's my best friend in the scene
06/05/2019, 11:15 - Divya Manjunath: And your equally a good friend
06/05/2019, 11:16 - Divya Manjunath: So just think rationally
06/05/2019, 11:20 - Jenit Jain: I'm not accepting anything. Yesterday I told her also that go talk blah blah. Then she's like I'll party with them in the middle. I've told her I get pissed when she cuts into my time. And moreover, I convinced all my friends for hepta only because dikshita wants hookah
06/05/2019, 11:20 - Jenit Jain: So now she can't do both
06/05/2019, 11:20 - Jenit Jain: I'm not settling for anything less
06/05/2019, 11:22 - Divya Manjunath: But full night shell be with u na. Nothing will happen if she goes for like 30 mins. Its not like she's going to stay out with them . Ultimately it's you only
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Jenit Jain: That's not happening either
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Divya Manjunath: Giving her 30 mins of her time with her friends isn't going to ruin anything
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Jenit Jain: No it's doesn't matter.
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Jenit Jain: Her friends don't give 2 shits about her which is why they stopped talking to her
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Jenit Jain: And she wants to go apologise to such people
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Divya Manjunath: So u want to ruin a beautiful relation because she just wants to say bye to bee friends??
06/05/2019, 11:24 - Jenit Jain: It's not that anymore
06/05/2019, 11:25 - Jenit Jain: That's just how it started
06/05/2019, 11:25 - Divya Manjunath: I'm being honest here, but they don't coz they're scared of you I guess
06/05/2019, 11:27 - Jenit Jain: Dude dikshita is in denial
06/05/2019, 11:27 - Jenit Jain: She keeps telling that you did it for no reason he didn't even have a crush
06/05/2019, 11:27 - Jenit Jain: Knowing that he confessed it 2 times. Once to me and once you her when they were alone after kerela
06/05/2019, 11:28 - Jenit Jain: So you explain to her whatever you want to. Don't waste time with me.
06/05/2019, 11:28 - Divya Manjunath: Wow
06/05/2019, 11:29 - Divya Manjunath: I think she knows what she wants
06/05/2019, 11:29 - Divya Manjunath: And she's trying to balance it but your not letting her do the same
06/05/2019, 11:30 - Divya Manjunath: Idk now, both of you take a decision that's best for you
06/05/2019, 11:45 - Jenit Jain: See all this half half knowledge is making you biased
06/05/2019, 11:46 - Jenit Jain: So yeah let us handle it
06/05/2019, 13:14 - Divya Manjunath: Good luck for exams

08/05/2019, 21:27 - Divya Manjunath: Dikshita told me properly what all happened and all
08/05/2019, 21:27 - Divya Manjunath: Like full series of events
08/05/2019, 21:27 - Divya Manjunath: And I just have 2 major questions
08/05/2019, 21:28 - Divya Manjunath: Actually 1 primary and the second one is secondary
08/05/2019, 21:28 - Jenit Jain: Okay ask
08/05/2019, 21:29 - Divya Manjunath: Why are you so insecure man
08/05/2019, 21:29 - Divya Manjunath: When u know she won't do anything
08/05/2019, 21:29 - Divya Manjunath: Like she'll never even think of it
08/05/2019, 21:30 - Divya Manjunath: Like why won't u let her go meet her friends for a while and all
08/05/2019, 21:30 - Divya Manjunath: What bothers u in that aspect
08/05/2019, 21:31 - Divya Manjunath: And secondly why do u get so destructive
08/05/2019, 21:32 - Divya Manjunath: Like u don't even know how many people are asking her in Chennai. Her naani literally asked her 10 times saying I know u wont drop ur phone like that , who did it
08/05/2019, 21:33 - Jenit Jain: Dude you get insecure when you don't trust the girl. So like I have told dikshita as well, I'm not insecure about most of the things. With pranjal I just don't like the toxicity and that extra variable. And with her classmates, after the anirudh and some other guybscene happened included alcohol. So I feel she's isn't 100% safe with them.
08/05/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: But yes I can't always protect her when she's away from me and moreover she doesn't want my protection all the time. This I learned from this fight
08/05/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: So yes I'm just trying to learn all this and improve. Obviously a long way to go
08/05/2019, 21:35 - Divya Manjunath: 2 years man, gotta build that trust
08/05/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: And I really wanted to prove a point being that I'm very serious and at that I really needed her to listen to me. So then she said something along the lines that yeah go ahead and throw my phone. In the sarcastic way. And to show her I really meant it I threw her phone. But yes obviously there's no excuse for it. Need to control myself man
08/05/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: Im going to do yoga from tomorrow onwards
08/05/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: Or I'll toh lose it
08/05/2019, 21:36 - Divya Manjunath: Once is fine, not some 5 times üòÇ
08/05/2019, 21:37 - Jenit Jain: Dude I trust dikshita. It's her classmates that I don't trust.
08/05/2019, 21:37 - Divya Manjunath: And threw her mess card and even tore her hall ticket wtf
08/05/2019, 21:37 - Jenit Jain: But I've learnt that it doesn't matter whether I trust them or not so fine, I'll accept that
08/05/2019, 21:37 - Jenit Jain: Again no excuse
08/05/2019, 21:37 - Divya Manjunath: She just doesn't say anything
08/05/2019, 21:37 - Jenit Jain: Aiyoo
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: I really fucked up this semester
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Divya Manjunath: Ur lucky
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: I can't even face her mom
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: Yeah man
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Divya Manjunath: Anyone else wud have slapped u
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Divya Manjunath: Or not taken ure shit anymore
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: But all this will be used in the future fights so üòÇ
08/05/2019, 21:38 - Jenit Jain: She did say twice I don't wanna be your gf
08/05/2019, 21:39 - Divya Manjunath: Obviously she cudnt tolerate ure drama
08/05/2019, 21:39 - Divya Manjunath: U were the one acting toxic
08/05/2019, 21:39 - Divya Manjunath: And not giving her , her freedom
08/05/2019, 21:39 - Divya Manjunath: Lol yaa she knows everything properly, in front of me only they were talking lol
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Divya Manjunath: But she also came back to you after u shed some tears
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: How detailed was her explanation
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: And how shitty did I look
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Divya Manjunath: Which were genuine
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: Yeah I was like whatttt
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Divya Manjunath: (I hope)
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: And she's like you don't take all these threats seriously
08/05/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: Duh
08/05/2019, 21:41 - Divya Manjunath: No her mom already knew, they were just discussing
08/05/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: Tell toh something from the discussion
08/05/2019, 21:42 - Divya Manjunath: They were talking about reimbursement
08/05/2019, 21:42 - Divya Manjunath: And they're blaming her only for the damage
08/05/2019, 21:43 - Jenit Jain: From me no?
08/05/2019, 21:43 - Jenit Jain: üôà
08/05/2019, 21:43 - Divya Manjunath: Her mom said no
08/05/2019, 21:44 - Divya Manjunath: From next time be careful da
08/05/2019, 21:44 - Divya Manjunath: She gets equally hurt and upset when u do such things
08/05/2019, 21:44 - Divya Manjunath: She's just stronger than u and doesn't show it
08/05/2019, 21:45 - Jenit Jain: Man my 2nd toe is longer than my main toe
08/05/2019, 21:45 - Jenit Jain: Which implies my spouse is going to rule me
08/05/2019, 21:45 - Jenit Jain: It's in my destiny

08/05/2019, 21:48 - Jenit Jain: For sure man.
08/05/2019, 21:48 - Jenit Jain: Such a bad semester
08/05/2019, 21:48 - Jenit Jain: Only wrong decisions I made
08/05/2019, 21:48 - Divya Manjunath: Ya
08/05/2019, 21:48 - Divya Manjunath: But it's not too late
08/05/2019, 21:48 - Divya Manjunath: Lot of time to learn
08/05/2019, 21:48 - Divya Manjunath: Ur just learning it the hard way
08/05/2019, 21:49 - Jenit Jain: Okay so this is wrong. I've been telling since 1.5 years that I don't like her friendship with so and so so she needs to put a barrier. She did tell him that she doesn't like him but he still had a crush on her which was a problem for me. Now because she can't confront the problem became so serious and then full blame comes on me.
08/05/2019, 21:49 - Jenit Jain: So what do you think about her failing to keep her end for 1.5 years and then gets pissed when I threatened after sooooo long
08/05/2019, 21:49 - Jenit Jain: Life bro
08/05/2019, 21:51 - Divya Manjunath: Arey now how she can control his feelings
08/05/2019, 21:51 - Divya Manjunath: There might be 100 other guys who have a crush on her, u just don't know them
08/05/2019, 21:51 - Divya Manjunath: She still listened to you when u told her not to talk to pranjal after the bekal thing
08/05/2019, 21:51 - Jenit Jain: You do realize that he told me he has a crush on her, and after my meeting, dikshita met him without telling me where he said and I quote, " but you never said no"
08/05/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: Not really
08/05/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: She stopped fighting only because I broke my hand
08/05/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: Otherwise the fight would have lasted entire semester or would have been resolved much earlier
08/05/2019, 21:55 - Divya Manjunath: But now I suppose this pranjal scene is over with
08/05/2019, 21:56 - Divya Manjunath: So Chuck him

08/05/2019, 22:06 - Divya Manjunath: Let her talk to them
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Divya Manjunath: It's not like she's going to go chill with them in their house n all
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Divya Manjunath: Just when she's with all of us, having one casual convo doesn't matter
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Jenit Jain: Have you been molested?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Divya Manjunath: Oh God
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Jenit Jain: Were you there when everyone just left her be and no one except me and my friends did Jack shit
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Divya Manjunath: Not again
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Jenit Jain: I'm asking from that pov

08/05/2019, 22:08 - Jenit Jain: Honestly this is the only question I'm concerned with
08/05/2019, 22:09 - Jenit Jain: Everything else is in the past
08/05/2019, 22:09 - Divya Manjunath: I think that u'll have to ask dik only
08/05/2019, 22:09 - Divya Manjunath: Of what she wants to do
08/05/2019, 22:09 - Divya Manjunath: Then randomly one day of she by mistake speaks to them again u'll get angry n all
08/05/2019, 22:10 - Jenit Jain: I think in this she has listened and agreed to with me unconditionally irrespective of what she wants because she knows and accepts the reason
08/05/2019, 22:10 - Jenit Jain: Exactly and I want to be prepared for this so that we don't fight which is the reason I'm asking you
08/05/2019, 22:11 - Divya Manjunath: From what I think, she at least wants to talk to them a little
08/05/2019, 22:11 - Divya Manjunath: So that's it's not awkward when in a group
08/05/2019, 22:11 - Divya Manjunath: Tbh the only person Ive seen that she gives no shit about talking or not
08/05/2019, 22:11 - Divya Manjunath: Is nethraa
08/05/2019, 22:12 - Jenit Jain: Doubt it seeing that she really just wants to stay away from the group except you
08/05/2019, 22:12 - Jenit Jain: Maybe sriya and upaasana

20/05/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: This is internship+ full time?
20/05/2019, 17:59 - Divya Manjunath: Rarely people get to sit for their PC
20/05/2019, 18:00 - Divya Manjunath: Idk what spot exactly is. But it's pi only mostly
20/05/2019, 18:00 - Jenit Jain: Wtf
20/05/2019, 18:00 - Divya Manjunath: Wait I'll show you message
20/05/2019, 18:00 - Jenit Jain: üôàüôàüôà
20/05/2019, 18:03 - Divya Manjunath: So, PC option was started so that you don't miss out on a company if it comes late. 

The rule goes like this:

1. If you have a *spot P* (placement) offer, you cannot sit for any company offering either P only or P+I, even if it is your PC. You can sit for any company offering only I (Internship) including your PC considering their on conversion CTC is greater than or equal to your current offer CTC

2. If you have a *Spot P+I* offer then you can't sit for any, even PC.

3. If you have a *Spot I* offer, you cannot sit for any company offering P+I  or I, including your PC. You can sit for all companies offering P only.
20/05/2019, 18:04 - Divya Manjunath: Hey, just to add to this. Almost all the companies last year had spot offers. So, I guess for most people PCs did not come into play at all.
20/05/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: Dude this is damn shitty
20/05/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: Were we told all this during the orientation

07/07/2019, 11:46 - Jenit Jain: She can't move past things
07/07/2019, 11:47 - Jenit Jain: And since we are different people she's like we aren't in sync
07/07/2019, 11:47 - Jenit Jain: And since that April thing she hasn't loved me the same way I love her
07/07/2019, 11:48 - Jenit Jain: And that she like always blames me for not having guy friends

07/07/2019, 11:49 - Jenit Jain: And what about the uncomfortablness I was feeling when I told her to handle pranjal and she did for so many semesters
07/07/2019, 11:49 - Jenit Jain: Then she's like her uncomfortableness is more than mine
07/07/2019, 11:49 - Jenit Jain: Since all her classmates also stopped talking to her
07/07/2019, 11:49 - Jenit Jain: How is it my fault that they chose pranjal over her
07/07/2019, 11:49 - Jenit Jain: I get blamed for the stuff that are wrong
07/07/2019, 11:49 - Jenit Jain: Not fucking my fault.

07/07/2019, 11:51 - Jenit Jain: And this has happened many times
07/07/2019, 11:51 - Jenit Jain: And always I've told her this annoys me more than normal so you don't do it
07/07/2019, 11:51 - Jenit Jain: Fucking get vedant and vatsal also read my messages

07/07/2019, 11:52 - Jenit Jain: So anyway yes, that's basically the thing that led to her breaking up
07/07/2019, 11:52 - Jenit Jain: Oh and she also doesn't like long distance
07/07/2019, 11:53 - Jenit Jain: So I don't know what's going to happen
07/07/2019, 11:53 - Divya Manjunath: Ya this she said
07/07/2019, 11:53 - Divya Manjunath: So it was sudden for u , or u expected it?
07/07/2019, 11:53 - Jenit Jain: Beautiful my journey was in Manipal and the end is like game of thrones ka end
07/07/2019, 11:53 - Divya Manjunath: Shit Mann this is dam sad, din expect it to happen like this
07/07/2019, 11:54 - Jenit Jain: She did say once she was thinking of a break in the vacation when we fought but she said I handled it well like the fight and cheered her up or something so she didn't do it.
07/07/2019, 11:54 - Divya Manjunath: What she says it, u'll never agree to do some things her way, hence that seems like someone is controlling her... And she doesn't like it
07/07/2019, 11:54 - Jenit Jain: But except that no idea it was coming
07/07/2019, 11:54 - Divya Manjunath: And she said she's trying to be friends with u
07/07/2019, 11:55 - Divya Manjunath: But man that'll be dam hard for u
07/07/2019, 11:55 - Divya Manjunath: It's not going to be easy
07/07/2019, 11:55 - Divya Manjunath: What I feel is so unfair in this whole thing is that she's finding it much easier to move on than u :(
07/07/2019, 11:55 - Divya Manjunath: Move on in the sense, trying to move on
07/07/2019, 11:55 - Jenit Jain: Man we both know she's too naive for the real world. Sometimes I'm just trying to protect her. Like physically. 1 time she's been molested and 1 times almost manhandled/molested byb1 of her classmates. That takes a toll on the boyfriend
07/07/2019, 11:56 - Jenit Jain: How easier?
07/07/2019, 11:56 - Divya Manjunath: She's not thaaat affected, atleast she's trying to show she's not and trying to be stronger and saying that's what's happened is the best for both of u
07/07/2019, 11:57 - Divya Manjunath: And friends is what both of y'all Shud be

27/07/2019, 17:20 - Divya Manjunath: And it's not spoiling anything
27/07/2019, 17:20 - Jenit Jain: You know all this triggers her especially because she doesn't have class friends
27/07/2019, 17:20 - Jenit Jain: She is screaming at me on pc

27/07/2019, 17:24 - Jenit Jain: I've been constantly triggered since the past fucking 20 days so when you come and ruin it a bit more than I ruined it myself, I will be angry
27/07/2019, 17:24 - Divya Manjunath: First of all it's not ruined

27/07/2019, 17:28 - Jenit Jain: I've decided that I'm going to try my best to move on I guess

27/07/2019, 17:32 - Jenit Jain: Good talk about me not that it will help but at least make her less angry at me
27/07/2019, 17:32 - Divya Manjunath: Ya thats the aim
27/07/2019, 17:52 - Jenit Jain: Thank you
27/07/2019, 18:25 - Divya Manjunath: I met her
27/07/2019, 18:25 - Divya Manjunath: I have told her not to just be mean and rude to u unnecessarily
27/07/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: You're already done?
27/07/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: What did she say
27/07/2019, 18:25 - Divya Manjunath: I was with her for an hour
27/07/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: Accha
27/07/2019, 18:26 - Divya Manjunath: But at the same time I think u Shud not try to call her and meet her so much
27/07/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: I'll try
27/07/2019, 18:26 - Divya Manjunath: It's because u do such things she gets irritated
27/07/2019, 18:26 - Jenit Jain: Only now because it's so messy
27/07/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: Later it will be chiller
27/07/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: .
27/07/2019, 18:28 - Divya Manjunath: This
27/07/2019, 18:28 - Jenit Jain: Okay
27/07/2019, 18:29 - Divya Manjunath: But I even told her that she shudnt have given u bt about u telling me about kshitij
27/07/2019, 18:29 - Divya Manjunath: She's like she doesn't know if uve told ur friends and that cud be problematic
27/07/2019, 18:29 - Jenit Jain: I'm done interfering in her life.
27/07/2019, 18:29 - Divya Manjunath: She doesn't feel so
27/07/2019, 18:29 - Divya Manjunath: Just let her be
27/07/2019, 18:30 - Jenit Jain: Yeah I know she says the same
27/07/2019, 18:30 - Divya Manjunath: And yes about the controlling part
27/07/2019, 18:30 - Divya Manjunath: Don't try to make her work ur ways, she def isn't going to listen now
27/07/2019, 18:30 - Jenit Jain: Okay
27/07/2019, 18:31 - Jenit Jain: What exactly did she say
27/07/2019, 18:31 - Divya Manjunath: Like she gave eg about u standing outside the block today
27/07/2019, 18:31 - Jenit Jain: Man she says something heavy and then doesn't care to reply
27/07/2019, 18:32 - Jenit Jain: I'm in too much anxiety
27/07/2019, 18:32 - Divya Manjunath: And how u were telling her to come down even though she wasn't ready
27/07/2019, 18:32 - Divya Manjunath: And u really need to stop giving dhamki about telling ur friends to do something to pranjal n all
27/07/2019, 18:32 - Jenit Jain: Plus that's not controlling her. That's just desperation
27/07/2019, 18:33 - Jenit Jain: Yeah there's no need to do anything anymore since she really doesn't want that much contact anyway
27/07/2019, 18:33 - Jenit Jain: Nothing will make anything better
27/07/2019, 18:33 - Jenit Jain: So I've given up
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Divya Manjunath: So I think best way to assure u'll move on is to not text her to often
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Divya Manjunath: Otherwise it'll always remind u and it'll hurt u
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Jenit Jain: I'll see
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Jenit Jain: Yeah but it's going to hurt anyway for too long
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Jenit Jain: 3 year fucking relationship
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Divya Manjunath: I understand
27/07/2019, 18:34 - Jenit Jain: She vaporized and stop caring about in one second
27/07/2019, 18:35 - Jenit Jain: It's fine I'll be fine
27/07/2019, 18:40 - Divya Manjunath: Yeq she clearly has moved on faster, but doesn't mean she doesn't care as such
27/07/2019, 18:41 - Jenit Jain: Doubt it
28/07/2019, 11:37 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
28/07/2019, 11:37 - Divya Manjunath: She came 2 nd In her branch

28/07/2019, 11:39 - Divya Manjunath: She told this to me last night
28/07/2019, 11:39 - Divya Manjunath: So I'm assuming she realized y'day
28/07/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: Wah

28/07/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: üò≠üôà

31/07/2019, 14:53 - Jenit Jain: What are you implying
31/07/2019, 15:00 - Divya Manjunath: Oohhh
31/07/2019, 15:00 - Divya Manjunath: Lol
31/07/2019, 15:00 - Divya Manjunath: Okay
31/07/2019, 15:00 - Divya Manjunath: I'll get Tom
31/07/2019, 15:18 - Divya Manjunath: And why u din take pouch da
31/07/2019, 15:39 - Jenit Jain: My mom had gotten an umbrella for her and she refused to take it. So why should I. Anyways she got it for her friends no so let her give them. As it is she mended her friendships right. That also in 1 day. Really shit friendships she must have if they can break in one day and become COMPLETELY normal again in 1 day. And she threw a 3 year relationship for such friendships. So yeah let her do her own shit I can't deal with anything related to her.
31/07/2019, 20:43 - Divya Manjunath: Oh God
31/07/2019, 20:43 - Divya Manjunath: Your taking it to harshly on ur self I feel
31/07/2019, 20:46 - Jenit Jain: Explain me one thing I said wrong upar
31/07/2019, 20:46 - Divya Manjunath: About the friendships
31/07/2019, 20:46 - Jenit Jain: I agreed I fucked up but you should see how those friendships are na.
31/07/2019, 20:46 - Jenit Jain: Baat karne ke liye I also talk to so many people
31/07/2019, 20:48 - Divya Manjunath: Like if she actually says, she shares a good bond with her class peeps, then she actually might
31/07/2019, 20:48 - Divya Manjunath: If not all, atleast 2-3
31/07/2019, 20:48 - Divya Manjunath: And she clearly likes being with them
31/07/2019, 20:49 - Jenit Jain: Kya hi bolu
31/07/2019, 20:49 - Jenit Jain: When you have no one and you get someone you don't really have a choice but to enjoy
31/07/2019, 20:55 - Jenit Jain: It honestly doesn't make sense discussing since everything is already in place. Like whatever was meant to be, is
31/07/2019, 21:01 - Divya Manjunath: True
31/07/2019, 21:02 - Divya Manjunath: Time is all that u need

04/08/2019, 22:10 - Divya Manjunath: Before she takes other decisions in her life
04/08/2019, 22:10 - Jenit Jain: And I'm keeping a facade of still trying to move on from her so you have to still play along in public
04/08/2019, 22:10 - Divya Manjunath: Hahaha okay
04/08/2019, 22:11 - Jenit Jain: I couldn't care any lesser with what she does in her life so I'm just waiting for the perfect time so at least it'll be a good scebe for me
04/08/2019, 22:11 - Jenit Jain: Like the more you ask more curious you'll get üòÇüòÇüòÇ
04/08/2019, 22:11 - Divya Manjunath: Ya but maybe her decisions might depend on what ur going to tell her
04/08/2019, 22:11 - Divya Manjunath: That's why better to finish it off soon
04/08/2019, 22:11 - Jenit Jain: what do you mean
04/08/2019, 22:12 - Divya Manjunath: Idk what ur going to tell her
04/08/2019, 22:12 - Divya Manjunath: But still
04/08/2019, 22:12 - Divya Manjunath: If it's about her classmates u Shud tell her asap
04/08/2019, 22:13 - Jenit Jain: but what do you mean by that tell
04/08/2019, 22:13 - Divya Manjunath: Arey just generally
04/08/2019, 22:13 - Divya Manjunath: For her benefit
04/08/2019, 22:13 - Divya Manjunath: If she's hanging out with the wrong people
04/08/2019, 22:14 - Divya Manjunath: So if acc to u , u have a reason to make her stop doing tjagv

04/08/2019, 22:15 - Jenit Jain: again, i couldnt care any lesser for her fucking benefit. the only thing i can do is respect that shes a girl but except that i owe her nothing hencei 'll do things my way without really being concerned about the consequences she might face.
04/08/2019, 22:16 - Jenit Jain: LOLLL if shes into people with such a low life then good for her let her do. i feel the same way about them as i did with anirudh before the molestation
04/08/2019, 22:21 - Jenit Jain: you do realise that for 3 years thats what i have done right. i tried. i know i eas right. and i failed. hence the breakup (partial reason). So why would i want to do the same thing again when i know nothing is going to change with her lol.
04/08/2019, 22:21 - Jenit Jain: shes too immature for life and i cant just wait to see how it fucks her up real good
04/08/2019, 22:24 - Divya Manjunath: Yes yes I understand that u don't care anymore. But since u respect she's a girl, before anything wrong happens, u Shud must tell her
04/08/2019, 22:24 - Divya Manjunath: Then taking action after that is her business
04/08/2019, 22:25 - Divya Manjunath: U don't even need to care and u have no reason to
04/08/2019, 22:26 - Divya Manjunath: Ughh I feel she's already fucking up üò≠üò≠
04/08/2019, 22:26 - Jenit Jain: and i dont
04/08/2019, 22:26 - Jenit Jain: and whatever i have to tell her wont really change her thinking about any guy

04/08/2019, 22:27 - Divya Manjunath: Arey and the worst part is there's no one to explain to her other than me rn
04/08/2019, 22:27 - Divya Manjunath: I'm eagerly waiting for this
04/08/2019, 22:27 - Divya Manjunath: Why can't u just tell me before her üò≠
04/08/2019, 22:28 - Jenit Jain: Lol she's happy that Manipal is getting over so

04/08/2019, 22:40 - Divya Manjunath: Why not tell it now only
04/08/2019, 22:41 - Divya Manjunath: So that she doesn't get closer to them so they it hurts more
04/08/2019, 22:42 - Jenit Jain: whatever i say to her wont really affect her friendships with her class people. so it doesnt matter!
04/08/2019, 22:42 - Divya Manjunath: Oohh

06/08/2019, 18:15 - Divya Manjunath: Relax
06/08/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Divya tbh, this is my shit and not yours. If I don't care, that should really imply that you shouldn't care either. Plus you know how much I loved her. So me not caring this much obviously has reasons I cant explain to you because I frame it but in my heart I know, that bitch didn't deserve me at all
06/08/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Which is one of the reason I really couldn't care any more for her
06/08/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Let it slide, love from her end wasn't real and hence

07/08/2019, 09:12 - Divya Manjunath: Arey it's not about that
07/08/2019, 09:13 - Jenit Jain: I'm glad you see it from that perspective
07/08/2019, 09:13 - Jenit Jain: If not, you have couple of reasons to be pissed
07/08/2019, 09:13 - Divya Manjunath: She's saying it's after breakup, whatever happened
07/08/2019, 09:13 - Jenit Jain: Before + after
07/08/2019, 09:14 - Jenit Jain: I have proof that I showed you so unless I'm a pro at Photoshop, you have no reason to believe her
07/08/2019, 09:14 - Jenit Jain: But whatever makes you happy believe it.

07/08/2019, 13:11 - Divya Manjunath: She said y'all were on a break
07/08/2019, 13:11 - Jenit Jain: Like I don't want you to take sides but if you're still 50-50 about cheating then we have no option
07/08/2019, 13:11 - Jenit Jain: You see how she keeps changing it for her cause

07/08/2019, 14:04 - Jenit Jain: I just saw anirudh and as soon as he saw me he went inside some door to hide
07/08/2019, 14:04 - Jenit Jain: üòÇ
07/08/2019, 14:12 - Divya Manjunath: üòÇüòÇ
07/08/2019, 14:12 - Divya Manjunath: Uve become one bully
07/08/2019, 15:28 - Jenit Jain: Feels good
10/08/2019, 10:24 - Divya Manjunath: Yo
10/08/2019, 10:24 - Divya Manjunath: I know jenit has my Instagram and i know hes read my chats with mahi even then im saying that i didn't do anything worse than what he already did with soumya for a reason. if he wants to know what that reason is he can come directly talk to me assuming hes not going to give gaali of course. if he doesnt want to know i have no issues. he can believe whatever he wants to get over me for that also i have no problem. but instigating you or anyone else against me without hearing me out is just not done. 
after hearing him talk the way he did that day as it is nothing is left in my heart and i have no interest in clearing stuff out honestly cause im too pissed at him for trying to ruin my new found peace. if he isnt a good judge of character its not my fault. if he didnt see how loyal i was to him for the past three years also its not my problem. but throwing shit my way is just getting out of hand now. 
he can come to talk to me instead of forcing you to accept this bullshit otherwise he can just go to hell and no i will not see him there.
10/08/2019, 10:32 - Divya Manjunath: Come online jenit!!!
10/08/2019, 10:34 - Jenit Jain: Lol
10/08/2019, 10:34 - Jenit Jain: You do know I have already told you that you don't have to take sides
10/08/2019, 10:34 - Jenit Jain: I just wanted you to admit that she cheated
10/08/2019, 10:34 - Divya Manjunath: No I just sent this
10/08/2019, 10:34 - Divya Manjunath: I asked her if I can send this to you, and she said yes
10/08/2019, 10:35 - Divya Manjunath: Go talk to her if u want to
10/08/2019, 10:44 - Jenit Jain: I'll just text her
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Divya Manjunath: üòÇüòÇ
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Divya Manjunath: Broo
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Divya Manjunath: It continuously said u were typing
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: I would love to see her explain me what happened in delhi. Plus I never even held hands or any fucking thing with somiya ever let alone suck some dick. Plus he couldn't even keep his dick intact before "finishing too early" üòÇ. So  no it's not the fucking same at all. Moreover I don't have time to instigate people against her. I just need people to know that it wasn't entirely my fault and how much shit can hide behind her innocent face. Because everything just thinks that I'm the possessive shithead who caused the entire breakup. Knowing that my possessiveness was right all along (seeing that she did cheat on me with him), it gives me a sense of calmness that I was right all along. And yes she's right, I'm not a good judge of character, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted 3 years of my life behind a girl like her. And I didn't force you to accept any BS and you know it. She is too immature for me anyway seeing that she uses people just to satisfy her need for attention. And if she calls that her "new found peace" then God save her.
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Divya Manjunath: I got scared only ki how much u were typing
10/08/2019, 10:46 - Jenit Jain: I sent it to her directly it's chill
10/08/2019, 10:47 - Divya Manjunath: Hmm cool

So I know about dikshita and mahiman in Delhi.
I've let her know that I don't want any ties with her.
I just want to tell you that these past 3 years, you've been an amazing friend and a very nice person. I have enjoyed your drunk talks and your help with everything. 
I have enjoyed our friendship and I'm grateful for meeting an awesome person like you.
All the best for your future.
See you (in case I ever make it to Gtech).

15/08/2019, 01:11 - Divya Manjunath: I'm texting praniti now lol
15/08/2019, 01:11 - Jenit Jain: Let me know all gossip and I'll do the same :p
15/08/2019, 01:18 - Divya Manjunath: Shit I wrote a very long message
15/08/2019, 01:22 - Jenit Jain: Ss please?
15/08/2019, 01:25 - Divya Manjunath: Ya wait let her reply
15/08/2019, 01:28 - Jenit Jain: Senddss
15/08/2019, 01:28 - Divya Manjunath: I knw she really likes spending time with him etc, he's a really nice guy but she doing all this at the expense of her other friendships. She's not met even one of us in 3 weeks and has legit just been with him. I'm sure no one wants to spend their last semester with only one person. She's just isolating her for no reason... She might feel she doesn't need more people but I dont understand how u can be like that. I've tired explaining to her a lotttt of times to spend a little time away from pranjal because that guy likes a her a lot and I feel it's a little selfish from her side for making it so hard for him to get over considering the fact that she always tells him that their just best friends.
15/08/2019, 01:28 - Divya Manjunath: But besides this, it's fine if she wants to spend all day with him, but I don't feel it's good for her if she doesn't hang out with others. What would u even look back at after college gets over if u just hang out with one person?
15/08/2019, 01:28 - Divya Manjunath: Her break up with jenit was ugly , idk what she's upto with mahiman and pranjal but all I knw she's in one big mess and she doesnt speak about it... And I  just feel it isn't healthy for her to just be with pranjal all day because he will do anything to be with her all day but she needs to be a little firm
15/08/2019, 01:28 - Divya Manjunath: I try my best to get her to chill with others but she always evades it by saying it's lazy and it's a little irritating tbh. I really care for her, and try to hang out with her but I think ure the one she actually listens to.And u Shud actually make  her realize that pranjal isn't the only one for her and she shud actually take a little effort to chill with others. What's the point of college life man when u just have 1 friend... Idk if she realizes this so I just wanted to talk to you about this and actually knw what's up in her mind
15/08/2019, 01:28 - Divya Manjunath: You'll be the best one to guide her :))
15/08/2019, 10:22 - Jenit Jain: Good messages
15/08/2019, 10:23 - Jenit Jain: Dekhte hai Kya hota hai
15/08/2019, 10:54 - Divya Manjunath: I‚Äôm genuinely so glad you told me this! I‚Äôll definitely speak to her about this because it‚Äôs the last time where you can genuinely spend time with all your college friends who have become family in these 4 years! I know she is super close to Pranjal and loves his company but he really likes her and she doesn‚Äôt so it might be misleading for him!
15/08/2019, 10:54 - Divya Manjunath: I think she just enjoys spending time with him and he motivates/ guides her to study really hard which is why she has been doing so well!
15/08/2019, 10:54 - Divya Manjunath: So there have been way too many things that have happened in the last few months! Whatever she has been telling Jenit is to help him move on because I can imagine how painful it must have been for him to break up after so long.
15/08/2019, 11:29 - Jenit Jain: Tell her that it's nothing of this sort because last sem she was alone and got her highest gpa
15/08/2019, 11:30 - Jenit Jain: I think forgot to tell her I moved on. Tell her lying doesn't give the ex a closure so
15/08/2019, 11:30 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
15/08/2019, 11:31 - Divya Manjunath: Good one
17/08/2019, 13:34 - Jenit Jain: Did dikshita tell you to not talk to me? Because she did tell me to not talk to you
17/08/2019, 13:35 - Divya Manjunath: No she din tell me anything like that
17/08/2019, 13:35 - Divya Manjunath: When she told
17/08/2019, 13:35 - Divya Manjunath: I heard some recording shit ur going to do
17/08/2019, 13:36 - Jenit Jain: Who said
17/08/2019, 13:36 - Jenit Jain: Yesterday we met and spoke for like 20 mins lol
17/08/2019, 13:42 - Jenit Jain: tell
17/08/2019, 13:42 - Divya Manjunath: About what
17/08/2019, 13:43 - Divya Manjunath: I really don't remember, I was too high
17/08/2019, 13:43 - Jenit Jain: the gossip finally reached her
17/08/2019, 13:43 - Jenit Jain: sure.
17/08/2019, 13:43 - Divya Manjunath: Dude I swear
17/08/2019, 13:43 - Divya Manjunath: What gossip
17/08/2019, 13:44 - Jenit Jain: you dont forget stuff when youre high
17/08/2019, 13:44 - Jenit Jain: that everyone knows now that she cheated on me
17/08/2019, 13:44 - Divya Manjunath: U SHUD have seen me dude , I was dead
17/08/2019, 13:45 - Divya Manjunath: Convo was good or bad
17/08/2019, 13:48 - Jenit Jain: shes basically like you know the shit going on in my family please dont my life harder by spreading nonsense. and i said, first of all its not nonsense because i have proof of the date and time you did it and she literally said "dont go into the technicals i didnt cheat on you". And i straight up told her that whatever I'm doing is to make myself feel better and not to make you feel bad. If in the process anything happens then you just face the consequences of her actions. Then shes like you are just taking revenge. and i said taking revenge, and me trying to make myself feel better about what happened are different sides of the same coin so she can take it anyway she decides to.
17/08/2019, 13:50 - Jenit Jain: and then she was literally jsut trying to win the argument by actually saying random shit that i wasnt there for her surgery but she was there for mine and how she pitied me after i broke my hand and how i "hit" her in the car in kerela. (In fact you know that i was just telling her to stay the fuck away from me)
17/08/2019, 13:50 - Jenit Jain: and she also said haha what have you even done for me in the past 3 years and i dieddddddd
17/08/2019, 13:50 - Jenit Jain: because legit the last 3 years were dedicated only to her so i dont know what the fuck was she saying.
17/08/2019, 13:54 - Divya Manjunath: Okay this I don't agree with her, she din even tell u About the surgery .. did she?
17/08/2019, 13:55 - Jenit Jain: nope i saw the bandage yesterday onl
17/08/2019, 13:55 - Jenit Jain: and she had pranjal waiting in kmc im sure so why is she just saying futile things
17/08/2019, 13:55 - Divya Manjunath: Ouch. U actually did a lot
17/08/2019, 13:56 - Divya Manjunath: Thats rude, even I was there

17/08/2019, 14:01 - Divya Manjunath: Arey I've not seen all this, how can I confirm
17/08/2019, 14:01 - Jenit Jain: arre get stuff out of dikshita nooo. tum bestfriend ho ya "bestfriend" ho
17/08/2019, 14:02 - Divya Manjunath: She had come home that day

17/08/2019, 14:02 - Divya Manjunath: Arey I don't ask so much detail

17/08/2019, 14:04 - Jenit Jain: i mean the good thing is, was my possessiveness ever wrong seeing how things are now? Validation that in manipal i've been wrong only about nethraa gives me some sense of peace :p wouldnt you agree
17/08/2019, 14:07 - Divya Manjunath: Lol, maybe
17/08/2019, 14:08 - Divya Manjunath: Ya but pranjal is clingy
17/08/2019, 14:08 - Divya Manjunath: Won't leave whatever happens
17/08/2019, 14:10 - Jenit Jain: i mean its dikshitas choice. if she doesnt want him to leave then he wont. I feel its a toxic relationship or whatever between them because dikshita is using him to fulfil her quota for attention and he is taking all this is the positive light and losing his self respect by getting used. Because no way people get this close without a negative thing looming over them. But well anyway its neither of our responsibility to tell people wtf to do (One of the things i learned from dikshita and im grateful for that at least).
17/08/2019, 14:11 - Jenit Jain: Murphy's Law: ANything that can happen wwill happen. 
so like me, you should sit back and enjoy the show
17/08/2019, 14:11 - Jenit Jain: :))))

17/08/2019, 14:16 - Jenit Jain: then i actually dont understand how dikshita is playing this. TBH and like genuinely honest, this isnt the dikshita i know.
17/08/2019, 14:18 - Divya Manjunath: Don't know what she's doing
17/08/2019, 14:19 - Divya Manjunath: As of now this.
17/08/2019, 14:30 - Jenit Jain: Dude honestly just like me, she hurting real bad. We just need to learn how to be single and make mistakes along the way. Her this phase is part of the mistake. Let her go through. It'll be fine. Tbh it's irritating how I can't hate hate dikshita
17/08/2019, 14:30 - Jenit Jain: Eh well so be it
