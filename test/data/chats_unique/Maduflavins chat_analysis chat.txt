05/02/2019, 17:38 - ‪+234 806 565 7232‬: Imagine that one person holds the passwords that can unlock millions of dollars. What happens when he dies?

The crypto exchange Quadriga CX has a big, expensive problem: It can’t retrieve the $145 million in Bitcoin and other digital coins held for its customers. Access was lost when its CEO Gerald Cotten passed away in December at age 30.

Cotten took sole responsibility for handling funds and coins, and now his widow says she can’t find his passwords or any business records for the company. Even experts couldn’t hack into his encrypted devices. 🔒

Now there's speculation about whether the business was a scam. (We *are* talking about the Internet here.) Keep reading: https://www.wbca.st/G1atG6w

I noticed that after you delete an entry from the db. Any entry you post still counts from the deleted entry
15/02/2019, 19:37 - ‪+234 703 833 4703‬: Like say I have:
id           name
---          ----------
1            John
2              Doe

Then I delete "2". & Then post a new name, it gets an id of 3

15/02/2019, 19:50 - ‪+234 703 833 4703‬: I end up having:
id           name
----          ---------
1            John
3            New name
15/02/2019, 19:51 - ‪+234 906 895 7364‬: i guess id there is the primary key. It won’t re occur
15/02/2019, 19:58 - ‪+234 703 833 4703‬: Yeah, it's the primary key

16/02/2019, 17:18 - ‪+234 806 548 6597‬: What's the Nigerian Tech community doing to contribute towards free and fair elections? These things are not rocket science, election after election INEC burns money in paying biased election observers can we replace same with cameras or some technology to really make votes count?
16/02/2019, 17:25 - FCC Madaubachi: Do the government tell you that they want technology interference?
16/02/2019, 17:33 - ‪+234 806 548 6597‬: So when they talk about free and fair what do they truly mean? 🤔
16/02/2019, 17:40 - ‪+234 806 548 6597‬: I remember some lineitems from the financial statements of some states we used to insult for,  you would be shocked how some people can be bold to give the description of handling a family issue or wife's needs using state funds. It seems we are not a serious people or what,  is the revolution not past overdue

16/02/2019, 18:44 - ‪+234 806 548 6597‬: So technology can give us true and fair elections? I mean we all have heard stories of vote buying and it is even labelled a crime,  if at the end of the day all parties deny these things happened, juxtaposed it with everything captured on camera for authenticity, also if our NIMC cards are effective do we need PVCs, I believe the switching software for ATMS can give account of all transactions across all the countries ATMs
16/02/2019, 18:46 - ‪+234 806 548 6597‬: I mean except if the free and fair elections I keep on hearing about means something else,  the tech community here and people of good will could crowd fund such projects  donate back to INEC and rather than protect ballot boxes we protect these adopted technologies.
