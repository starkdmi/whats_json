21/02/2020, 07:01 - +974 5000 8321: I boarded flight  from Bangalore to Mumbai, economy class. I put my hand bag in overhead bin and took my aisle seat. There was an old person sitting next to me on the window seat. 
I had a presentation in Mumbai, so took my documents and started going through them for the final time before the presentation. After 15–20 minutes I was done with my documents, so I put them away and started looking out of the window, and suddenly I looked at the face of this person sitting next to me. I thought I have seen him somewhere.

He was old, his face, the suit was not very expensive, and he was replying to some mails or going through some documents. I exactly don’t know. I noticed his shoes, they were average quality. 
Something stuck me and I asked him: 
*“Are you Mr. Narayana Murthy?”*

He looked at me, smiled and replied, *“Yes, I am.”*

I was shocked ! 
For one second I had no idea what to say next. I looked at him again. His shoes, his suit, his tie and his specs. Everything was average. This guy was worth $2.3 Billion and co-founded Infosys. 
I always wanted to become super rich so that I can buy all the luxury and travel business class. He could buy the whole airlines and yet he was sitting next to me in economy class!

I again asked:  *“Why are you travelling in economy class and not business class?”*

He replied: 
*“Do Business class people reach early?”*

And then introduced myself, “Hello sir! My name is Mayank Gupta and I am a freelance corporate trainer and I work with many MNCs PAN India.”

He then put his phone away and started listening to me, he also asked few questions and answered the questions I asked. We both went down deep into the conversation until I asked a question which was about to change my life entirely.
I questioned:
*Sir, You are so successful and have made so many good decisions in your life. Is there something you regret?”*

He got intense look on his face, thought for a while and answered,
*“Sometimes my knee hurts, I should have taken better care of my body. When I was young I was so busy working that I never got time to take care of myself and now even if I want to work more, I can’t. My body doesn’t permit.”*
*“You are young. You are smart and ambitious but don’t repeat the mistake I made. Take proper care of your body and take proper rest. This is the only body you have got!”*

That day I learned two things, one that he told me and another that he showed me!

Being rich is not about owning things.
I had got what I needed.

02/03/2020, 21:31 - Venkat Qtr: Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Zanjan University
  Corona virus arrives in any country, sooner or later there is no doubt that many countries have no diagnostic sets or equipment, so
  Please use as much as possible of natural vitamin C to strengthen your immune system.
  Don't worry, C gets rid of it a lot, and it's fine.
  
    The virus currently contains no vaccine and no specific treatment
  Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous
  This disease appears to be caused by gene fusion in a snake and bat, and it has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.

It is important to keep the message on your greatest knowledge: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Slices of lemon in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life."  *
   Even if you work, you should take a look at this message and pass it on to others! The lemon cut into three parts and put in a cup, then pour hot water and turn it into (alkaline water), 
  After reading, talk to someone else and transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
  Council:
  Professor Chen Horin notes that anyone who receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life...
  I have done my job and I hope you can help me develop it as well.
 They published it in academic groups
02/03/2020, 23:28 - Arun Qtr: Will anyone buy lemon 🍋 and bring it to office tomorrow? I will make lemon water for you guys 👍

04/03/2020, 06:30 - Venkat Qtr: From someone at 4C --  I wanted to share a couple of quick tips that a family member forwarded to me.  His company is headquartered in Japan, and this note was sent to all their employees.
While I don’t have the exact sources to site, the suggestions for how to stay healthy seem simple & logical.  I’m no doctor, but these tips couldn’t hurt.  Stay safe & healthy out there, kids!
Firs thing in the morning, take a deep breath and hold it for more than 10 seconds.
If you complete it successfully without coughing, discomfort, stuffiness or tightness, it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, indicating no infection.
These are critical times so self-check every morning in a clean environment
Serious advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. 
Ensure your mouth and throat are moist and never dry.  
Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least.
Which means, always have a bottle of water wherever you go.
WHY? 
Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your esophagus and into the stomach.
Once in the tummy...your stomach acid will kill all the virus.
If you don’t drink enough water regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the lungs which is very dangerous
Drink lots of water with lemon or apple cider vinegar.
Take great care of your immune system and stay healthy!!
04/03/2020, 08:31 - Qtr Pavan: Unicef
The corona virus is large in size with a cell diameter of 400-500 micro, so any mask prevents its entry so there is no need to exploit pharmacists to trade with muzzles.

The virus does not settle in the air, but on the ground, so it is not transmitted by the air.

The corona virus, when it falls on a metal surface, will live for 12 hours, so washing hands with soap and water well will do the trick.

Corona virus when it falls on fabrics stays for 9 hours so washing clothes or exposing them to the sun for two hours is enough for the purpose of killing him.

The virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes so putting the alcohol sanitizer in the pocket is enough for the purpose of prevention.

If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27°C, it will be killed, it does not live in hot areas. Also drinking hot water and exposure to the sun is good enough.
Stay away from ice cream and cold food is important.

Gargling with warm water and salt kills tonsils and prevents them from leaking into the lungs.

Adhering to these instructions is sufficient to prevent the virus.

17/03/2020, 14:59 - +91 81254 07188: The Chinese president at Wuhan Hospital without muzzle ..
 China officially announces victory over the Corona virus

 Did the Chinese deceive the world with the Corona Virus?  And they saved their economy ?!

 This is what the Americans and Europeans think, after they sold their shares in high-value-added technology companies for a minimal price to the Chinese government.

 According to them, the Chinese leadership used an "economic tactic" that made everyone swallow the bait easily, before they asserted that China did not resort to implementing a high political strategy to get rid of European investors, in support of China's economy, which would bypass the US economy with this step ..!

 And because it teaches the science of certainty that Europeans and Americans are looking for excuses to slow and bankrupt the Chinese economy, China has sacrificed some hundreds of its citizens, instead of sacrificing an entire people ..!

 Through this tactic, China succeeded in "deceiving all", as it reaped about $ 20 billion in two days, and the Chinese president succeeded in deceiving the European Union and the United States of America in the eyes of the world, and played an economic game of a tactical nature, which was unthinkable.  !

 Before the Corona virus, most of the stocks and stakes in investment projects at "Technology and Chemicals" production plants were owned by European and American investors ..!

 This means that more than half of the profits from the light and heavy technological and chemical industries went to the hands of foreign investors, not to the Chinese treasury, which led to a decline in the Chinese currency, the yuan, .. and the Chinese central bank could not  To do something against the continuous fall of the yuan ..!

 There was even widespread news that China was unable to purchase masks to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.  These rumors and the Chinese President’s statements that he is “not ready to save the country from the virus” have led to a sharp drop in the purchase prices of shares of technology companies in China, and the empires of “foreign” investors have raced to offer investment shares for sale at very low prices, and with attractive offers,  "Never seen before" in history ..!

 The Chinese government waited for foreign share prices to reach their "almost free" minimums, and then issued an order to purchase them.  And bought the shares of Americans and Europeans ..!

 And when European and American investment financiers realized that they had been deceived, it was too late, as the shares were in the hands of the Chinese government, which in this process nationalized most of the foreign companies erected on its soil in a near-free manner, without causing a political crisis or a single shot ..  !

 The same sources confirmed and pointed out that "Corona" is a "real" virus, but it is not a terrible danger that has been promoted across the world ..!

 China began to take out the anti-virus vaccine, this vaccine that it had owned from the beginning on the shelves of refrigerators after it had received its goal ..!

25/03/2020, 09:52 - Qtr Vinod: Currently lockdown and curfew imposed at many places. But you need to go out for daily essentials. Follow these ONEs.

ONE person: Identify one adult in a family for going out. Only he or she will go out. NOBODY ELSE.

ONE dress: Use only one dress and same dress every time you go out. Use full length dress. Don't mix this dress with your other dresses. 

ONE wallet: Use only one wallet. Don't mix these currency, coins and cards with other which already are there at home.

ONE shopping bag: Use only one and same shopping bag every time. 

ONE vehicle: Use same vehicle and key. Avoid public transportation.

ONE go: Avoid going out multiple times. Finish all your work in one go.

Avoid taking mobile phone or restrict using it.

Avoid crowding and come back immediately once you finish your work.

Use your non dominant hand or elbow to open the door or push the buttons. 

Once you come back: Keep your dress, wallet, bags, keys in a separate bag. Don't mix with others. Do thorough hand wash and face wash before touching anything and anyone. Clean your mobile phone surface with sanitizer. Best is to avoid mobile phone. 

Remember, we CAN'T AVOID exposure but CAN REDUCE exposure.

It brings up your camera and then 30 seconds later you have a tiger in your house! You can take a photo of the kids with them and they can walk around it. 

We’ve tried lion, bear, shark, penguin, horse, pony, octopus and cheetah too but am sure there will be others.

Everyone is talking about the 21 day lock down but no one knows what to do on day 22.
Sharing a small article on what can happen and what we can do to control it.

01/04/2020, 11:13 - BM: Few lessons learnt in past few days: 

 1. United States is no longer the world's leading country.
 2. China won the 3rd World War without firing a missile and no one could handle it.
 3. Europeans are not as educated as they appear.
4. We can survive vacations without trips to Europe and USA.
5. Rich people are in fact less immune than the poor.
 6. Human beings are opportunistic and despicable no matter their socioeconomic position when prices are rising.
7. No priest, poojari, usthad or God saved patients .
 8. Humans are the real viruses on the planet.
9. We can spend Billions of Rupees on poor without red tapism.
10. Health professionals are worth more than a footballer.
11. Oil is worthless in a society without consumption.
12. How animals feel in the zoo.
13. The planet  regenerates quickly without humans into play.
14. Majority of people can work from home.
15. We and the kids can survive without junk food.
16. Prisoners in jails for petty crimes can be released.
17. Living a hygienic life is not difficult.
18. Only women are not supposed to know cooking.
19. There are a lot of good people in the World.
20. If you build more schools, you have to construct less hospitals.
21.Media is bullshit.          

Stay blessed 😊

10/04/2020, 10:30 - Arun Qtr: Hahah
10/04/2020, 10:30 - Qtr Bernard: It is Like a confusing question. If we consider the sentence in the image “how many 3’s in the image” then one answer . Arun has to tell since he is UX designer
10/04/2020, 10:32 - Qtr Vasantha: I have considered sigal strength also so
10/04/2020, 10:32 - Qtr Bernard: Even I don’t know which one is correct ? Even the person who shared this post doesn’t have the right answer

10/04/2020, 10:34 - Qtr Bernard: All 3’s in the image include that question, then one concrete answer is there
10/04/2020, 10:34 - Qtr Bernard: Let’s see others answer
10/04/2020, 10:34 - Qtr Pavan: Question is not an image
10/04/2020, 10:34 - Qtr Pavan: Image only key board
10/04/2020, 10:35 - Qtr Bernard: Ok then we will have 2 answers then. With question and without question
10/04/2020, 10:36 - Qtr Bernard: BA 😁 is justifying
10/04/2020, 10:38 - Qtr Pavan: Question – 1 rabbit saw 6 elephants while going to the river. Every elephants saw 2 monkeys going towards the river. Every monkey holds 1 parrot in their hands. Now, how many animals are going toward the river?
10/04/2020, 10:40 - Qtr Pavan: This question checks our English n mathematics understand
10/04/2020, 10:44 - Arun Qtr: 11 animals I have included birds also  or if trickenglish then 25 animals
10/04/2020, 10:52 - Qtr Bernard: 5 is correct?
10/04/2020, 10:54 - Qtr Jene: 5
10/04/2020, 10:56 - Rabeek Qtr: 3
10/04/2020, 10:58 - Qtr Rizwan: 3
10/04/2020, 10:59 - Qtr Bernard: Confusing too much pavam
10/04/2020, 10:59 - Qtr Bernard: Please explain pavan
10/04/2020, 11:00 - Qtr Bernard: It’s 3 or 5
10/04/2020, 11:04 - Venkat Qtr: "To the river" is different than "towards river" 😋😃
10/04/2020, 11:06 - Qtr Bernard: Yes Venkat correct , so we shoul not include elephants ?
10/04/2020, 11:08 - Qtr Sabeer: If numbers 1+6+2+2=11,
If “which animals” , only 4, “rabbit, elephant,monkey and parrot “
10/04/2020, 11:11 - Qtr Pavan: 5 answer
10/04/2020, 11:12 - Qtr Bernard: Pavan we are not sure , tell us the answer
10/04/2020, 11:12 - Qtr Pavan: 5
10/04/2020, 11:12 - Qtr Bernard: Question is different na, towards or to the river
10/04/2020, 11:12 - Qtr Pavan: Here rabbit saw elephants while going to the river it means on the way it saw
10/04/2020, 11:13 - Qtr Pavan: Rabbit is already going towards river but not elephants
10/04/2020, 11:14 - Qtr Bernard: Oh
10/04/2020, 11:14 - Qtr Pavan: And 2 monkey going towards river and having 1 parrot in their hands so total 4 +1 (rabbit)=5
10/04/2020, 11:15 - Qtr Bernard: I didn’t include elephant
10/04/2020, 11:17 - Qtr Bernard: Rabbit is not going. 6 elephants are seeing the same 2 monkeys with 2 parrots ... so 10!
10/04/2020, 11:18 - Qtr Bernard: 5 is wrong pavan
10/04/2020, 11:19 - Qtr Bernard: See the question, how many animals are going towards to river
10/04/2020, 11:19 - Qtr Bernard: 10 May be correct I guess
10/04/2020, 11:19 - Qtr Pavan: Here rabbit is going not elephants
10/04/2020, 11:31 - Qtr Bernard: It’s confusing. 🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏼‍♂️

10/04/2020, 11:57 - Qtr Bernard: 😁
10/04/2020, 11:57 - Qtr Bernard: Let me read the question again, I think I’m going to 15th time. Wasting our time I guess
10/04/2020, 11:59 - Qtr Gaurav: 😓
10/04/2020, 11:59 - Qtr Bernard: Yes Gouvrav. Every elephants saw 2 monkeys. Means only 2 monkeys are there, so same monkeys right. Are you trying to say it is 12?
10/04/2020, 12:00 - Qtr Gaurav: Yeah i meant same 😁 but you decide how many going we will accept 🤣🤣

16/04/2020, 20:46 - +91 98842 80634: 7
16/04/2020, 20:46 - Qtr Gaurav: I think 7
16/04/2020, 21:03 - Venkat Qtr: 6
16/04/2020, 21:04 - Venkat Qtr: In the 1st 5 races you pick winners and final race of all the 5 winners to pick top 3 position
16/04/2020, 21:05 - Venkat Qtr: How 7?
16/04/2020, 21:09 - Venkat Qtr: Rizwan answer plz
16/04/2020, 21:12 - +91 90957 06916: No. There may be an chances suppose if 3 fastest are in the first match right?
16/04/2020, 21:13 - Venkat Qtr: No watch to measure the time  😄
16/04/2020, 21:13 - Venkat Qtr: Even then unless you race all 5 groups u cant conclude which 3 are fastest
16/04/2020, 21:14 - Venkat Qtr: If stop watch is there then minimum race is 5 and if no watch then one final race required,  so 6
16/04/2020, 21:14 - Venkat Qtr: It's my logic....owner has to reveal the answer 😂
16/04/2020, 21:18 - +91 90957 06916: No, pls imagine this scenario., in the first race you pick 5 horses. There may be chances of 3 or 2 fastest horses in the same match right
16/04/2020, 21:19 - Qtr Rizwan: 7
16/04/2020, 21:19 - +91 98842 80634: In first 5 th race the all the last and 2nd last Will be eliminated....then in 6th attempt  the last horses from  4th row column 1 ,5th row column 1 eliminate so.ultimately removing the horses from this row....
In 7th race we are left with 6horses in that 3 possibility is there
16/04/2020, 21:23 - Qtr Pavan: To find the fastest, you need to run all 25 horses at least once, and since you can only race 5 horses at a time, you need a minimum of 25/5 = 5 races. Then you need to compare the winners of these races, which means a 6th race is necessary.
16/04/2020, 21:24 - Qtr Pavan: To find the second fastest, you need at least 1 more race to compare between 1 n 3
16/04/2020, 21:24 - Qtr Pavan: Hence total 7 races optimally
16/04/2020, 21:25 - +91 98842 80634: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
16/04/2020, 21:26 - Qtr Rizwan: 5 races of 5 group.. 

one race winner of each group to determine Fastest  ( say this as main Race)

Second fastest & 3 rd fastest will be any following

1. Runner & 3rd place of group of winner of main race

2. Runner in Main race &  runner in the group of Runner in main race.

3. 3rd palce in main Race

Have a race between these 5 horses





Say a .

16/04/2020, 21:37 - Venkat Qtr: Frankly I'm confused 🙄🤔🤔
16/04/2020, 21:39 - Venkat Qtr: Why u need one more to find 2nd fastest? Isn't it 6th race amongst the winners tells you rank of all 5 winners?
16/04/2020, 21:42 - Qtr Bernard: Vinod I got answer from my friend who had completed Ph.D in maths. He is telling answer is 6.
16/04/2020, 21:43 - Qtr Rizwan: Need not be .. Second fastest can be from the group of Fastest...
16/04/2020, 21:46 - Qtr Bernard: <Media omitted>
16/04/2020, 21:47 - Qtr Bernard: Vinod is this right/expected result?
16/04/2020, 21:50 - Qtr Vinod: No 😂 It was intended end these type of questions in the group but it backfired here 😂
16/04/2020, 21:50 - Qtr Rizwan: 😂😂😂
16/04/2020, 21:50 - Qtr Bernard: 🤣🤣🤣
16/04/2020, 21:55 - Qtr Bernard: In my college Whatsapp group they are trying to answer for this. Some friends are pinging me privately and asking me the correct answer 🤔
16/04/2020, 22:01 - Qtr Vasantha: Looks like you guys covered most of questions from internet
16/04/2020, 22:02 - Qtr Vasantha: Do you guys know online game where everyone in this group can participate?
16/04/2020, 22:04 - Qtr Bernard: Oh which website Vasanth ?
16/04/2020, 22:04 - +91 90957 06916: Whether 7 is correct?
16/04/2020, 22:04 - +91 98842 80634: Yes
16/04/2020, 22:04 - +91 90957 06916: How?
16/04/2020, 22:05 - +91 90957 06916: 😳😳😳
16/04/2020, 22:05 - +91 90957 06916: This message was deleted
16/04/2020, 22:11 - +91 90957 06916: Lets we can take Each group 5 and can pick 3 winners in each group. 6th match we can set it for top winners of each group, then we can pick the top winner.

In the 6th match, which horse are last two that entire group we can eliminate. 

So now totally now  8 horses ( 2nd & 3rd positions of 6th race and 3 second positions and 3 third positions) 

In the 7th match, pick 5 horses (2nd & 3rd position of 6th race and 3 horses of 2nd position ) 

7th match winner is the second position

In the 7th match, last 3 lost horses will be removed and its group's third positioned horses also removed so remaining 1 will be there
 It is third position(totally 8 - in that, 1 is the second position and 6 horses are removed and the remaining one is the third fasted horse) 



So totally 7 matches... Whether my logic correct 🤔🤔🤔

18/04/2020, 22:12 - Qtr Bernard: Correct Venkat 👍

Gopal 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Explain the logic
18/04/2020, 22:21 - Qtr Gopal: He gave 350 worth and 1650 as change
18/04/2020, 22:22 - Qtr Bernard: Shopkeeper took 350 na, and gave 1650 to lady. It is Kallaas. Then how ?
18/04/2020, 22:22 - Venkat Qtr: Actually shopkeeper 1 gave 2000 to shopkeeper 2 and 350 worth item
18/04/2020, 22:22 - Venkat Qtr: Rizwan you need to explain how 2000 is correct answer 😂😁
18/04/2020, 22:23 - Qtr Bernard: This message was deleted
18/04/2020, 22:24 - Qtr Bernard: We are not referring google and sincerely answering.
18/04/2020, 22:24 - Qtr Rizwan: Transcation is all about fake currency..  Lady gave 2000 fake currency and in return she got 350 rupees groceries and 1650 in cash...
18/04/2020, 22:24 - Venkat Qtr: But shopkeeper 1 lost 2000 rupees and 350 worth groceries onow
18/04/2020, 22:24 - Venkat Qtr: Know*
18/04/2020, 22:25 - Qtr Bernard: Yes
18/04/2020, 22:25 - Qtr Bernard: Here we are talking about shopkeeper na Rizwan bhai
18/04/2020, 22:25 - Qtr Rizwan: He lost 350 worth groceries and 1650 in cash
18/04/2020, 22:26 - Venkat Qtr: No riz, how much he gave it to shopkeeper 2?
18/04/2020, 22:26 - Venkat Qtr: 2000 note is fake, so it should be included in total and 350 worth groceries hence 2350
18/04/2020, 22:28 - Qtr Rizwan: To explain easy

Asssume Shopkeeper had no cash  only 350 worth groceries 

His 350 grocery = 350 cash now 

Once the shopkeeper 2 ask to return money. He has to get addtional 1650 and add 350 with him and return 2000
18/04/2020, 22:29 - Venkat Qtr: Where is the grocery worth 350 he lost to the lady?
18/04/2020, 22:30 - Rabeek Qtr: E. 4000 is correct

18/04/2020, 22:32 - Qtr Rizwan: 👍🏻👍🏻
18/04/2020, 22:32 - Venkat Qtr: Shopkeeper 2 gave 2000 initially and that's what he took back Rabeek
18/04/2020, 22:32 - Venkat Qtr: Bcos we took so long to answer interest is 2000, so answer is 4000

03/07/2020, 17:30 - +91 81254 07188: IT giants have started to vacate rented buildings at all major IT parks . 
They have planned to open "Supervising hubs" (controlling offices) in small buildings. 
75 to 90% staff are going to work from own natives. 

Next major change being made silently by NASSCOM (with +2800 IT & related company members in india) have approached  Central /State Govts  to

 i) amend or abolish major ( 75%)portion of Labour laws to suit IT sector  "*work from home"* ....
Central Govt has given consent in the last week of May 2020 itself & advised NASSCOM to give blue print of amendment in Labour laws
 ii) to amend Income tax Act to include expenses by Employer/Employee incurred at home, amendment to cover insurance for working from home.

So it is just a matter of time before Acts/Laws are amended. So "*Work from home**" has come to stay. So no more necessity for IT people to stay at Metropolitan cities only . Also the hiring has started by major IT companies but offers are being rolled out with WFH  conditions & lesser pay compared to before . So this year appraisal will see 0 hike, 
0 variable & layoff of higher paid professionals. 

*How will it impact salaried IT professionals ?* 
Let's divide them in two categories . 
*Category 1* : Professionals with own home or home loan in major cities like, Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai , Chennai , Hyd & Pune . 

*Category 2*: Bachelors with few years of experience who live in rented places 

*Category 2* will relocate happily to their hometowns & be  able to save more. Even if Companies give less pay , still they will be able to create a decent balance between earnings & savings....
*Category 1* will face the double impact of inflation in cities as already it can be seen with jacked up prices of Vegetables & Fruits , FMCG products ( processed foods ) , Lower property rentals (almost halved) & a small negligible reduction in existing home loan rates of around 2 %. 
The properties will come for distress sales due to job loss or non availability of rentals ; Forget buying new house from builder , as the market is already flooded with resale & distress sales. 

The best example one can see is that *monster.com* has introduced a category of "covid impacted" profiles & there are already 18 lac *”Covid Profile Resumes”* in their portal. So it means 18 lac IT professionals already lost their job &  have selected "Covid Impacted " option .....

*What can one do to safeguard their future ?* 
1. Try to keep your unnecessary expenses under control. 
2. Avoid loans. 
3. Save as much as You can by avoiding taxes . It's no more a desire to save but need of the hour is to *survive recession* ..
*Yes you heard it right .. recession for next 3-4 years*.

Technology with AI , IOT is the way forward . 


!! *Best Wishes to All* !!

08/07/2020, 22:39 - Qtr Pavan: ***Arbeit/ Job***

If you have a job & your company is still operating, be very grateful

WHY?

1. Victoria's Secret declared bankruptcy.
2. Zara closed 1,200 stores.
3. La Chapelle withdrew 4391 stores.
4. Chanel is discontinued.
5. Hermes is discontinued.
6. Patek Philippe discontinued production.
7. Rolex discontinued production.
8. The world's luxury industry has crumpled.
9. Nike has a total of $23 billion US dollars preparing for the second stage of layoffs.
10. Gold's gym filed for bankruptcy
11. The founder of AirBnb said that because of pandemic, 12 years of efforts were destroyed in 6 weeks.
12. Even Starbucks also announced to permanently close their 400 stores.
13. WeWork isn't in a great spot either

The list goes on & on

See the US economy landscape :

Nissan Motor Co. may close down in USA

1. Biggest Car Rental company (Hertz) filed for bankruptcy - they also own Thrifty and Dollar
2. Biggest Trucking company (Comcar) filed for bankruptcy - they have 4000 trucks
3. Oldest retail company (JC Penny) filed for bankruptcy - to be acquired by Amazon for pennies
4. Biggest investor in the world (Warren Buffet) lost $50B in the last 2 months
5. Biggest investment company in the world (BlackRock) is signalling disaster in the world economy - they manage over $7 Trillion
6. Biggest mall in America (Mall of America) stopped paying mortgage payments
7. Most reputable airline in the world (Emirates) laying off 30% of its employees
8. US Treasury printing trillions to try to keep the economy on life support
9. Estimated no. of retail stores closing in 2020 - 12,000 to 15,000. The following are big retailers that have announced closing:

- J. Crew
- Gap
- Victoria's Secret
- Bath & Body Works
- Forever 21
- Sears
- Walgreens
- GameStop
- Pier 1 Imports
- Nordstrom
- Papyrus
- Chico's
- Destination Maternity
- Modell's
- A.C. Moore
- Macy's
- Bose
- Art Van Furniture
- Olympia Sports
- K Mart
- Specialty Cafe & Bakery
and many many more

Unemployment claims reached an all-time high of 38+ million - unemployment is over 25% (out of 160 million of work force, close to 40 million are jobless). With no income, consumer demand is falling drastically and the economy will go into a free fall. This is just USA...

Under the weight of the new crown pandemic, many giants are facing the crisis of failure. 5 months of pandemic created a LOT of debt, and tens of thousands of companies went bankrupt. If you have business & your company is still there, and there are no pay cuts or layoffs, pl treat your company & customer well. Humans are facing the pandemic that cannot be controlled. The second half of 2020, is the challenge of corporate strength & relationship

2020 is about survival. Take care of yourself & your loved ones. Be happy with what you have!

First called actors *Rishi, Irfan* 

Then the director & the story writer *Basu Chatterjee*  then...

Music director *Wajid Khan* 

Thereafter needed one dashing talent actor so, *Sushanth Singh* .

Now for heroine he called one new face  *Siya Kakkar* - TikTok fame,

Needed a dance director so called *Saroj Khan* ,

Last but not the least needed one comedian to add some spice so, called *Jagdeep* ( Surma Bhopali - famous character of movie, Sholay),

Villan will be played by *Vikas Dubey, Kanpurwala* .....

 *Movie cast complete.....* 

 *Now he needs audience* ....

Be careful, Stay at home....
Be safe....

19/08/2020, 21:24 - Qtr Sneha: To All who are working from Home,

I want to share one bad experience of my friend's friend who was working from home (non-infy)

He started working from home in march like all of us, due to team member's network issues, unavailability of laptops There was heavy workload on him, he used to work for 12-13 hrs, multiple calls, meetings, Lunch/breakfast along with work. After one month his right leg got slight swelling, he went to general physician.after few more days he started facing little difficulty while breathing. Considering this is normal, he ignored n continued to work as usual 12-13 hrs. 
One day he suddenly collapsed and fainted, became unconscious for almost five minutes. His wife along with society members gave him first aid to gain consciousness. He immediately admitted hospital n moved to ICU for three days. Obviously covid test done for him, fortunately it was negative. Few more blood tests were done. Blood clots found in his legs. Doctor said prolonged sitting led to formation of blood clots in legs, once clots forms they can travel to lungs, one od the reason for his breathing issue.
He took leave for one month. He called me shared this experience and told me that this incident changed him completely about his views towards life, work and how important health is.

Your health should be of the utmost importance and at the top of your priority list. When your health is not in good condition, every other aspect of your life suffers. 

So many of us working like this ingoring body singnal.  I just want to request you all to avoid sitting for long hours continuously, take 5-10 min break after every 2 hrs, take small walk. Avoid work from bed, sofa, maintain proper posture, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.

Just wanted to share this with you all, as most of people currently working from home. Please please avoid sitting for long hours without taking breaks.

share this message with all your friends who are WFH.

18/09/2020, 22:28 - Qtr Pavan: The Product Owner’s Misconceptions 

Waiter: receives orders and sends them directly to the team. The waiter behavior results in low-business value and pointless features.
Manager: micromanages the team and behave as the boss of the development team.
Architect: defines all the solutions alone. The development team has no voice on how to solve problems.
18/09/2020, 22:31 - Qtr Pavan: The Product Owner acts as a waiter. In this scenario, the Product Owner does not own the prioritization. Instead, they only receive the stakeholders' wishes, write down the product backlog items, and give it to the team without questioning the need.
The Product Owner should challenge each request and become the visionary of the product, where he or she sees the big picture and understand what makes sense and what doesn’t!

18/09/2020, 23:05 - Qtr Pavan: What happens to stories that are not finished in a sprint?

It's quite common that some user stories remain unfinished by the end of the sprint (for example, tasks turn out to be more complicated than initially forecasted, team member falls sick, the story has a defect). In such a case, the development team can follow the steps below to manage this situation: 

First, discern, which part of the story remains unfinished and estimate its story points.

Second, do not count the points of the incomplete story towards the team's current velocity (Something can be considered complete only when it's releasable to a customer. The customer does not derive any value from an incomplete story).

Third, put the story back into the product backlog and reprioritize it. Please do not assume that it's still a high priority item. Let the product owner tell you that. However, common sense dictates that you should finish what you've already started but let the product owner decide that. Due to shifting business priorities, the story's importance (priority) might change.

Next, during the sprint retrospective, reflect on why the team could not complete the story within the sprint timebox. This step is critical to improving overall team performance.

13/11/2020, 22:34 - Qtr Pavan: Today my thoughts drift down the memory lane, back to the simpler child hood days ,I suddenly recall my mom's warmest hugs, the fragrance of grandma-made  laddoos and kara boondi, the memories of my dad coming back home with shopping bags full of new clothes, the Deepavali tales from the olden days narrated by my grandfather gathering all his grandkids at the verandah. Nostalgia is beautiful, isn't it?

Growing up in a big  family, Deepavali was more like a mini carnival for my multitude of cousins and me. Without our moms nagging us, we would all spring out of the beds early, put on our new attires and zoom straight towards the terrace to dry up our crackers in the sun for them to produce the loudest sounds during the evening! As we impatiently waited for the sun to go down, . The afternoon called for a visit to the local Deepavali bazaar where we stocked up on clay diyas, decorative lights, mud castles, puja ingredients and some more crackers!

Evenings were the most awaited part of the celebration as every member of the family donned their flashy outfits, got their hands on the scrumptious Deepavali feast and sweets, and finally made way to the terrace to witness the enchanting light and sound show under the brightest sky of the year! Nothing, literally nothing, could beat the satisfaction of your crackers outlasting the next door kid's collection!🎆🎆🎆🎇🎇

Wishing you and your family a very happy and safe Deepavali .🤩🤩💥💥🎇🎇
13/11/2020, 23:07 - Qtr Gaurav: Nicely captured and feels the similar memories 😊 wishing all a very happy Diwali 💥💥💥
