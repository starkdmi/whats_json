13/11/18, 21:17 - Zain Asif: That way, he'll become the one below all
13/11/18, 21:22 - Zain Asif: I must apologise... that's a shitty joke, but I'm having trouble coming up with jokes about the fellow, we don't seem to have much leeway
13/11/18, 21:24 - Vishal Karve: Didn't know about this character.. wow marvel universe is broken

14/11/18, 10:04 - Angad: Yeah... Didn't even get to see a Tentacruel 😕
14/11/18, 10:06 - Zain Asif: Honestly, Mr Mime, Hypno and Jynx are the ones with real potential
14/11/18, 10:07 - Zain Asif: Apparently, I associate the psychic type with rapeyness🤔
14/11/18, 10:08 - Zain Asif: I like to think Bill Cosby's team would be 2 drowsees, a hypno, a mr mime and a smeargle
14/11/18, 10:08 - Vishal Karve: It puzzles me that in a realistic version, psychic Pokemon don't rule the world
14/11/18, 10:09 - Zain Asif: Alakazam becomes the Jew?
14/11/18, 10:09 - Vishal Karve: More like a government run by Alakazams
14/11/18, 10:09 - Zain Asif: Yeah, same thing
14/11/18, 10:10 - Zain Asif: /👁\
14/11/18, 10:10 - Zain Asif: __

14/11/18, 10:12 - Zain Asif: I just pictured mega alakazam going ham losing all _sanyas_ points
14/11/18, 10:13 - Zain Asif: Wait I can't remember the difference between male and female alakazams - male kadabras had bigger tails
14/11/18, 10:13 - Zain Asif: I think the Alakastash was longer in males
14/11/18, 10:14 - Zain Asif: Why cant I think of any later gen creeps?
14/11/18, 10:14 - Angad: Yeah...  I think
14/11/18, 10:14 - Angad: We don't know the later gens as well
14/11/18, 10:14 - Angad: Groagunk
14/11/18, 10:14 - Zain Asif: I mean the closest I can think of is the gropey animation of dusclops
14/11/18, 10:15 - Zain Asif: Oh yeah, that one has potential
14/11/18, 10:17 - Vishal Karve: If you're looking for potential, rule34 is the. place. Never ceases to surprise me
14/11/18, 10:17 - Zain Asif: Nah that just distorts anything and everything
14/11/18, 10:18 - Zain Asif: There's only so much of gardevoir a person can handle
14/11/18, 10:18 - Zain Asif: I do NOT want to see charizard rule34

22/11/18, 11:16 - Vishal Karve: Is there a good explanation for having body pillows in your room? Asking for a friend
22/11/18, 11:29 - Zain Asif: Doctors advised against usage of conventional pillows ever since the diagnosis of BWD
22/11/18, 11:30 - Zain Asif: It's an increasingly common condition in those who spend long hours viewing a computer screen
22/11/18, 11:30 - Zain Asif: Add some bullshit details for the particularly nosy fuckers
22/11/18, 11:31 - Vishal Karve: BWD?

22/11/18, 11:50 - Zain Asif: BBC
British Broadcast Corporation offer a large amount of information to the british public which many people seem to use as their only source of information about the outside world. Unfortunately the influence they possess is staggering causing much aggravation to pretty much anything involved with Britain.

We need Justice for a brutal case with 16 years old girl, raped and murder at Gaya. 

Search for below tags 
#GayaBrutality
#NirbhayaInGaya
#JusticeForAnjana

We want CBI enquiry for this case, as Gaya Police has held the parents captive, and they are tampering the evidences. And blaming parents for *Honour Killing* 

Which is totally absurd. 

All we need is, your help in getting this matter to higher authorities and CBI, so that we can have a fair investigation on this matter.

Just tweet with your comments or simply retweet.

You can get all the relevant news by following  aforementioned Tags. 

Thanks for your help.

As you'll must be knowing I have been doing the Teach For India Fellowship for the last two years. My older set of students are finishing Grade 10 and like all the other schools, my school team wishes to give them a farewell the day after the last Boards paper. We are fundraising for the same and are looking for generous donors willing to help us actualize the program. Even contributions like Rs. 500 will be helpful to meet the cost for the farewell.
Do let me know if you'll would be keen on donating.
Regards,
Dakshesh

18/04/19, 01:04 - Zain Asif: They've got Yugi, Deku, and even mr Omae wa mou Shindeiru himself
18/04/19, 01:04 - Zain Asif: Kenshiro
18/04/19, 01:05 - Angad: Surprised no Bakugo n todoroki
18/04/19, 01:05 - Angad: Kenshin
18/04/19, 01:05 - Zain Asif: Yeah, it's only Midoriya... they probably planned these guys for dlc
18/04/19, 01:07 - Zain Asif: From the characters I've fought, Cell and Rukia were the most annoying to face. Other than them, it seems pretty balanced
18/04/19, 01:11 - Zain Asif: I can imagine Arun spamming that one move of his
18/04/19, 01:14 - Angad: Also... Shortly after this msg was sent City made it 3-2
18/04/19, 01:32 - Rohit Raj: It’s just crazy. 😅
18/04/19, 02:06 - +1 (780) 245-6786: What a match
18/04/19, 02:24 - +1 (780) 245-6786: Holy shit. Best match of the champions league for years!
18/04/19, 02:27 - Angad: !!!!
18/04/19, 02:27 - Angad: This message was deleted
18/04/19, 02:29 - Angad: VAR and Away Goals are great!!
18/04/19, 08:40 - Rohit Raj: Best match anywhere man. 😅
18/04/19, 08:41 - Angad: I was screaming and running around after 4th goal.... Almost missed the fifth
18/04/19, 12:11 - Angad: There is a ned stark death parody with Background music from saas bhi kabhi bahu thi....
I can't find it... Anyone seen/have that?
18/04/19, 12:11 - Angad: Or some other Indian Soap
18/04/19, 12:11 - Angad: This is very important ppl

22/04/19, 01:29 - Ranjeet Kumar: Downloaded and watching. 😅
22/04/19, 01:32 - Ranjeet Kumar: *Late night Antakshari* 😂
22/04/19, 01:38 - Angad: It'll come in like 6hrs.... Just wait ppl
23/04/19, 11:19 - Arun Chutiya: https://youtu.be/s2kpr4AXPU8
23/04/19, 11:48 - Angad: Yeah all a shit show rite now.... Wonder if the day will ever come when G Nev criticises Ole... Probably never
27/04/19, 09:48 - Angad: Endgame was awesome
27/04/19, 09:55 - Rohit Raj: Gandu mouth shut please
27/04/19, 09:55 - Rohit Raj: Discuss it over personal chats
27/04/19, 09:55 - Rohit Raj: Please
27/04/19, 09:55 - Rohit Raj: No spoilers
27/04/19, 09:55 - Angad: Hehehe
27/04/19, 09:56 - Ranjeet Kumar: There are No Spoilers. 😂
27/04/19, 09:56 - Angad: This message was deleted
27/04/19, 09:56 - Ranjeet Kumar: Except this. 😅
27/04/19, 09:57 - Vishal Karve: This was leaked way before everything
27/04/19, 09:58 - Vishal Karve: Wow you captured the deleted message
27/04/19, 09:58 - Ranjeet Kumar: Loop hole. 😎
27/04/19, 09:59 - D K: Hahah
27/04/19, 13:21 - Arun Chutiya: Goku original until ssj3  vs saitama. Who wins ?
27/04/19, 13:22 - Amit Agrawal: Saitama 🤔
27/04/19, 13:24 - Zain Asif: There hasn't been an all out Saitama fight, unlike Goku (maybe not for SS3) hence we don't know just how powerful he is
27/04/19, 13:25 - Zain Asif: One real advantage goku has is speed because of instant transmission
27/04/19, 13:26 - Arun Chutiya: Not just that.. the entire freeza fight was just mere minutes but it took so many episodes to finish. So am assuming he's faster than saitama
27/04/19, 13:27 - Arun Chutiya: Gokus fight can potentially destroy planets.. 🤷‍♂
27/04/19, 13:28 - Zain Asif: Not necessarily, unless every instance of screaming HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is actually just exhalation slowed down
27/04/19, 13:29 - Arun Chutiya: Goku could do the side step clone in dragon balls itself
27/04/19, 13:29 - Zain Asif: This. The power scaling in dbz is beyond anything else I've seen, except for the last 15 minutes of gurren lagann
27/04/19, 13:30 - Vishal Karve: It's kinda unfair.. if Saitama was in DB universe, he'd be able to fly and do all kinds of stuff. Fucking Videl can do it
27/04/19, 13:31 - Zain Asif: Saitama's durability is limitless. We don't know if goku can damage him, since he's never been injured in a fight. The most powerful opponent he's faced claimed to be at the planet destruction level and didn't even scratch him
27/04/19, 13:32 - Zain Asif: Goku could technically win by instant transmitting saitama to the remains of planet vegeta if he wanted to, but there's no chance he'd ever do that
27/04/19, 13:36 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
27/04/19, 13:36 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
27/04/19, 13:36 - Arun Chutiya: Vishal life is unfair now answer the question 😂😜

27/04/19, 13:37 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
27/04/19, 13:39 - Arun Chutiya: I think if Goku fights just a hand to hand combat no energy blasters then saitama would win for sure
27/04/19, 13:39 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
27/04/19, 13:40 - Vishal Karve: Uhh you like em chunky?
27/04/19, 13:40 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
27/04/19, 13:40 - Vishal Karve: Auto download, bitch
27/04/19, 13:41 - Zain Asif: Not gonna lie, that search was the gayest thing I've done. Ricardo's butt is not something you want to see in your search bar
27/04/19, 13:41 - Vishal Karve: But don't worry I didn't get it
27/04/19, 13:41 - Zain Asif: Aww yiss
27/04/19, 13:42 - Vishal Karve: Why tf were you searching Ricardo butt
27/04/19, 13:42 - Zain Asif: Who's seen the movie, by the way? Just Angad?
27/04/19, 13:42 - Zain Asif: For the sake of this joke
27/04/19, 13:43 - Zain Asif: No context spoilers
27/04/19, 13:54 - Arun Chutiya: Oh and @919663969696 Eid scenes ? You're here that time ?
27/04/19, 13:54 - Zain Asif: Yup... I'll be done by then
27/04/19, 14:56 - Arun Chutiya: Nicee
27/04/19, 18:02 - Arun Chutiya: Has anyone tried the thanos trick on google ?  Google just thanks and click on the gauntlet
27/04/19, 18:02 - Arun Chutiya: Just thanos*
27/04/19, 18:03 - Ranjeet Kumar: Done that.

01/05/19, 08:56 - Arun Chutiya: Ha but ajax  have an away goal advantage na.. will be tough for spurs
02/05/19, 02:15 - Angad: Messi 600!!!

02/05/19, 02:35 - Rohit Raj: Neither did Langlet did anything in defence
02/05/19, 02:35 - Rohit Raj: It’s just that Liverpool didn’t take their chances
02/05/19, 02:35 - Rohit Raj: Do*
02/05/19, 02:35 - Rohit Raj: But yeah, messi was out of the world

02/05/19, 02:45 - Manoj M: 😅

08/05/19, 02:09 - Rohit Raj: 😂
08/05/19, 07:19 - D K: Somewhere at the back of my mind I was still hoping for what Liverpool  pulled off last night.
08/05/19, 07:23 - Angad: Fuck man... My Leo's legacy is being failed by Barca.. and Man Utd is an Omnishambles
08/05/19, 07:25 - D K: Now I can only hope Brighton plays the match of their life on the last Gameday.
08/05/19, 07:26 - Angad: I want Liverpool to get Aguerooooooooed
08/05/19, 07:36 - D K: Wow remember who was on the wrong side of Aguero in 2012 ?🤔

08/05/19, 10:16 - Sebin cherotha: And @917795791689 I have no idea about your iron man question
08/05/19, 10:30 - Zain Asif: What's the question?
08/05/19, 10:31 - Sebin cherotha: Which comic arc was the first movie based on
08/05/19, 10:31 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
08/05/19, 10:31 - Zain Asif: It was uploading!
08/05/19, 10:32 - Zain Asif: It's his origin story where he's locked up with Yinses
08/05/19, 10:33 - D K: Haha
08/05/19, 10:33 - D K: So whats the name ?
08/05/19, 10:38 - Zain Asif: It's from the original issues of iron man
08/05/19, 10:40 - Sebin cherotha: Lego suit iron man?
08/05/19, 10:40 - Zain Asif: I dont remember the title, but it was from the 60s, maybe the 70s. It wasn't that great a read
08/05/19, 10:41 - D K: You've read it ?
08/05/19, 10:42 - Zain Asif: Incredible iron man, invincible iron man? Somethimg like that
08/05/19, 10:42 - Zain Asif: I read some. It got pretty boring because they wrote the comics so as to have every issue work as a stand alone story. This was before comic book subscriptions were a common thing
08/05/19, 10:43 - D K: Oooo ok
08/05/19, 10:43 - Zain Asif: Every story followed the same pattern. Stark is chilling. Someone finds some flaw or something to put him at a disadvantage. In the last minute he pulls some clever move and saves the day
08/05/19, 10:45 - Zain Asif: I dont remember the title, but they had iron man in this gay ass pose on the top corner of the cover. I think I showed this to Sebin while reading. I read this stuff in the second year
08/05/19, 10:47 - Sebin cherotha: You did. It looked like shit even for a 70s comic
08/05/19, 10:47 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
08/05/19, 10:47 - Zain Asif: Approximately
08/05/19, 10:48 - D K: Ugg
08/05/19, 10:53 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
08/05/19, 10:54 - D K: You have the comic with you ?
08/05/19, 10:54 - Zain Asif: Also, he used to actually put on the suit. Like manually
08/05/19, 10:54 - Zain Asif: I think so

28/06/19, 22:17 - Vishal Karve: How much snacks we need? 2 Doritos ok?
28/06/19, 22:17 - Arun Chutiya: No dip on me

28/06/19, 22:20 - Arun Chutiya: I want dip. If you have dip get 4 packets of doritos with dips 😝
28/06/19, 22:20 - Vishal Karve: Ok
29/06/19, 01:46 - Vishal Karve: <Media omitted>
29/06/19, 07:14 - Rohit Raj: Everyone reached safely..?
29/06/19, 08:12 - Amit Agrawal: Yes
29/06/19, 11:07 - Manoj M: 🤘🏼

16/07/19, 18:29 - Manoj M: <Media omitted>
16/07/19, 18:29 - Bobby Dixit: ame
16/07/19, 18:29 - Bobby Dixit: same
16/07/19, 18:29 - Bobby Dixit: to me as well
16/07/19, 18:29 - Bobby Dixit: he is alive apparently
16/07/19, 18:30 - Manoj M: <Media omitted>
16/07/19, 18:31 - Manoj M: <Media omitted>
16/07/19, 18:31 - Bobby Dixit: that or someone murdered him and just to make people believe that he is alive unlocks his phone from his fingerprint, sends out linkedin invite and text from various apps to people just to throw people off the murder
16/07/19, 18:31 - Bobby Dixit: 🤔 not entirely impossible
16/07/19, 18:50 - Zain Asif: If that's the case, you lot were his most recently contacted friends. Which would mean it is also possible that Siddharth was being controlled for the last three years by some other entity
16/07/19, 18:50 - Bobby Dixit: fuckkkkk now it all makes sense
16/07/19, 18:52 - Zain Asif: Since a lack characteristic responses would tip us off, quitting the group was an obvious choice. Also, it was a warning we could have heeded🤔
16/07/19, 18:54 - Bobby Dixit: yeah but as people were pushing that murderer to join the group he joined
16/07/19, 18:55 - Bobby Dixit: to throw off the suspicion but as time passed he realized that he can slowly slide away, and left the group without any suspision
16/07/19, 18:56 - Bobby Dixit: what if Paresh and Kacho murdered him and build the perfect cover 😵😵😵
16/07/19, 19:01 - Zain Asif: And then threw the body out a window like Kacho's laptop
16/07/19, 19:02 - Bobby Dixit: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
16/07/19, 19:17 - Sebin cherotha: Fond memories
16/07/19, 19:31 - Bobby Dixit: <Media omitted>
16/07/19, 19:31 - Bobby Dixit: Does this mean modi wont come to murder me anymore 🤔
16/07/19, 19:36 - Manoj M: maybe if you share your ITR details and sign a small declaration for me, I can help you find that.
16/07/19, 19:40 - Amit Agrawal: I also got the same 🤔🙂

26/08/19, 09:12 - Rohit Raj: Guys, I am getting engaged on 26th of October. It is going to be a very small and simple ceremony back in my hometown in Bihar (Bhagalpur). Not a grand event or something.

It would be great if you guys can make it. 



In DK’s words :
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages
As most of you'll know, Swaroopa and I are planning on getting engaged. The ceremony will be held on 26th October at Bhagalpur in Bihar. (The city is famous for being the backdrop of Gangajal movie) 
Wherever you are on the globe please do schlep your way to Bhagalpur especially since its an occassion for all of us to get together and we're not sure if anyone is getting engaged or married soon enough. 
Hope to see you guys there and when you guys do come don't run your mouth like DK does or you'll will get halalofyed.

02/10/19, 12:23 - D K: I wish your save at that match was better than this.
02/10/19, 12:26 - Manoj M: Hahaha.. Dude dk can forget how you let the ball just roll away between your legs. While attempting to save 😁
02/10/19, 12:43 - Zain Asif: Fuck that, the kick I remember is when I hit Manoj in the head with my knee. He was on my team
02/10/19, 13:41 - Manoj M: 😄
02/10/19, 14:58 - Zain Asif: Apparently not. I find myself uncertain. Not sure if it was Manoj or Sid
02/10/19, 14:59 - D K: Dude if you had kneed Sid, you wouldn't be texting us now.
02/10/19, 15:00 - Zain Asif: Nah, it was accidental and in the middle of a game
02/10/19, 15:00 - Zain Asif: He wouldn't do much
02/10/19, 15:01 - Zain Asif: Besides, he'd have been sort of disoriented at the time, having just been kneed in the head by me
02/10/19, 15:02 - D K: You have a history of bad body blows to wingmates
02/10/19, 15:03 - Zain Asif: I distinctly remember it being a scuffle to save a goal, all three of us defending at the time. Sid was the keeper
02/10/19, 15:03 - Zain Asif: Correction. Sid does. Ask @17209993062
02/10/19, 16:22 - Manoj M: Between us, I remember the two of us colliding head-on and i bounced a few meters off 😄
02/10/19, 16:22 - Manoj M: Laws of physics experience 😁
02/10/19, 16:36 - D K: Dude colliding with Zain doesn't always follow CoLM. I'm proof.
02/10/19, 16:36 - Manoj M: CoLM?
02/10/19, 16:36 - D K: Conservation of Linear Momentum 😱🙄
02/10/19, 16:38 - Manoj M: Chutiye..
02/10/19, 16:39 - Manoj M: You have a CoM issue bro
02/10/19, 16:39 - Manoj M: So its beyond CoLM 😄

24/10/19, 21:02 - D K removed Rohit Raj
24/10/19, 21:02 - D K: Hi
So since its Rohit's engagement and he's the first one to be from the wing, I was wondering if we could all contribute money and gift him something. Mallus from our batch generally have some tradition of gifting something. Can we
- align on a gift
- nominate a PMU kinda SPOC to collect cash
- purchase and transport
Thoughts ?
24/10/19, 21:05 - Bobby Dixit: SPOC😂
24/10/19, 21:05 - Bobby Dixit: In
24/10/19, 21:05 - D K: Haan man lingo is very consultingy
24/10/19, 21:05 - D K: Ok 2 in. Others ?
24/10/19, 21:06 - Zain Asif: What in helheim is an SPOC?
24/10/19, 21:06 - D K: Single Point of Contact
24/10/19, 21:06 - Zain Asif: Also, I love how you gave him the heads up before kicking him
24/10/19, 21:06 - D K: How did I ?
24/10/19, 21:07 - D K: I kicked him out first
24/10/19, 21:07 - Zain Asif: I'm in too, by the wat
24/10/19, 21:07 - Bobby Dixit: Sarcasm chut
24/10/19, 21:07 - D K: 3 in.
24/10/19, 21:07 - D K: Others ?
24/10/19, 21:07 - D K: Also start spitting out gift ideas
24/10/19, 21:08 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
24/10/19, 21:08 - Zain Asif: We'll be giving him an actual proper gift, right? Not some gag gift
24/10/19, 21:08 - Vishal Karve: In.
24/10/19, 21:09 - D K: Strange
24/10/19, 21:09 - D K: Come up with something na
24/10/19, 21:09 - Bobby Dixit: I was actually thinking to give a gag gift
24/10/19, 21:10 - D K: Engagement can be semi gag
24/10/19, 21:10 - Bobby Dixit: 😛
24/10/19, 21:10 - Zain Asif: See that's why I asked
24/10/19, 21:10 - Vishal Karve: We could do both . But don't reveal the actual gift until later 😁
24/10/19, 21:10 - D K: 4 in.
24/10/19, 21:10 - Zain Asif: In that case, a gag should suffice
24/10/19, 21:10 - D K: Others ?
24/10/19, 21:10 - Zain Asif: _Pulp fiction intensifies_
24/10/19, 21:10 - D K: Ok so ideas for gag gifts ?
24/10/19, 21:11 - Bobby Dixit: 🤔 need to be related to bihar
24/10/19, 21:11 - Bobby Dixit: and short hight
24/10/19, 21:11 - Amit Agrawal: In
24/10/19, 21:11 - D K: Dude
24/10/19, 21:11 - D K: Not an omni
24/10/19, 21:11 - D K: 5 in.
24/10/19, 21:11 - Bobby Dixit: 😛
24/10/19, 21:12 - Zain Asif: Dammit an omni's too expensive
24/10/19, 21:12 - D K: 8 to go
24/10/19, 21:12 - Bobby Dixit: 😂
24/10/19, 21:13 - D K: Lets reserve omni for Ranjeet
24/10/19, 21:13 - Bobby Dixit: ahh that true
24/10/19, 21:13 - Bobby Dixit: hi which team he likes in football, manu?
24/10/19, 21:13 - D K: Manu 🤔😂😂
24/10/19, 21:14 - Zain Asif: High heeled men's shoes? Our vice principal from school used to wear those
24/10/19, 21:14 - D K: Yuck. What a bad way to intimidate kids
24/10/19, 21:14 - D K: Tch tch.
24/10/19, 21:14 - Bobby Dixit: 😂
24/10/19, 21:14 - Zain Asif: I know this because I fell asleep on the basketball court and woke up to the sight
24/10/19, 21:14 - Bobby Dixit: not a bad idea
24/10/19, 21:15 - D K: Ok search for brands and products.
24/10/19, 21:16 - Zain Asif: I beg to differ. This particular idea is rather elegant, actually. It serves as both a proper gift and a gag gift, if the pair of shoes in question is a good pair of shoes that just happens to have high heels
24/10/19, 21:17 - D K: No man idea for gift is good
24/10/19, 21:17 - D K: Its a sucky teacher idea
24/10/19, 21:18 - Zain Asif: Oops, I misread that as imitate. Sorry, vice and intimidate do not go well together in a sentence
24/10/19, 22:09 - D K: 5 were in. Rest 8. C'mon lets get the ball rollinh

23/12/19, 22:19 - Ranjeet Kumar: Old Monk Trivia:


Some believe that Ved Rattan Mohan met "Gumnami baba" few times during this period and he named his creation after Gumnami baba, who was an old monk and believed to be as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose by a group of Netaji enthusiasts and researchers, though there is no particular proof behind this. This doctrine also supports the fact that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose never died out of the plane crash and came back to India as a monk and lived a spiritual life in disguise.

We have decided to start this new chapter from the place where it all started. So the marriage ceremony would take place at Bokaro Steel City (Jharkhand).

Letting you all know well in advance so that all of you can plan accordingly.

There would be a reception party back at my hometown as well on 13th and I would wish that you all be there as well.

03/04/20, 21:20 - D K: Can some CS IT soul translate to English
03/04/20, 21:22 - Ranjeet Kumar: Not a bad idea.
03/04/20, 21:26 - Manoj M: Why does that sound like English to me already 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/04/20, 21:28 - D K: Koi matlab samjaho yaar
03/04/20, 21:31 - Amit Agrawal: English hi toh hain
03/04/20, 21:32 - Amit Agrawal: Could be bad if all samples in pool are positive
03/04/20, 21:32 - D K: ARRR
03/04/20, 21:32 - D K: This is some DSA right?
03/04/20, 21:32 - Amit Agrawal: Binary search
03/04/20, 21:33 - Amit Agrawal: 16 people ka sample ko mix karke test karenge 
If negative then all negative
03/04/20, 21:33 - Amit Agrawal: If positive 
They will divide in 2 groups of 8 each 
And test again
03/04/20, 21:33 - Amit Agrawal: And continue in similar fashion
03/04/20, 21:34 - Zain Asif: So it reduces the number of required testing kits
03/04/20, 21:34 - Manoj M: Bhai it was also there in numerical methods.

Math course 3.
03/04/20, 21:34 - Amit Agrawal: In randomized input yes 
But if maximum people in pool are positive it might actually increase it
03/04/20, 21:35 - Amit Agrawal: Let's say all 16 are positive 
Then
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 +16 test need to be done
03/04/20, 21:35 - D K: tIRRcal didn't have Numerical Methods
03/04/20, 21:36 - D K: I think all departments didn't even get differential equations
03/04/20, 21:36 - Amit Agrawal: Maybe from the test data they have it might have the pattern in which more people are negative 
Then yes it will decrease overall tests
03/04/20, 21:36 - Manoj M: True.
03/04/20, 21:36 - Amit Agrawal: Binary search was taught in 2nd  sem dk
03/04/20, 21:36 - D K: And now my Masters apps are stuck
03/04/20, 21:37 - D K: DD mila tha Deepak Prabhu mein
03/04/20, 21:37 - Amit Agrawal: Haha
03/04/20, 21:37 - D K: I used to copy Chalisgaonkar's codes from batch 1
03/04/20, 21:37 - Amit Agrawal: Hmm
03/04/20, 22:06 - Ajay sathya: Only more than 95% of your samples should be negative to get that kind of speed up! 😛
03/04/20, 22:07 - D K: I heard. Been digging up info on this method
03/04/20, 22:07 - D K: Would be possible in some states

05/05/20, 19:34 - Ajay sathya: Moreover, that just reminded me of the creepy moment when you kept mumbling "where is my sue?" Till I realized you meant shoe. 😝
05/05/20, 19:34 - D K: I can imagine Ajay saying it in that Bangy way
05/05/20, 19:34 - D K: Lul

06/05/20, 22:55 - Zain Asif: Is zoom objectively better?
06/05/20, 22:55 - D K: This is the only place in the world I hear and can still use the N word
06/05/20, 22:55 - Zain Asif: That's because you apparently hang out with a bunch of bitch ass niggers outside of this group
06/05/20, 22:56 - Zain Asif: Also, I take full blame. I use the word far too frequently
06/05/20, 23:04 - D K: Ya well
06/05/20, 23:04 - D K: occupational hazard
06/05/20, 23:49 - Manoj M: Yes.

06/05/20, 23:50 - Manoj M: But the question is, who has zoom paid version.

07/05/20, 12:43 - Zain Asif: Oh yeah, I'd meant to ask, how does this work? Does the call happen on the browser or something?
07/05/20, 12:48 - Ranjeet Kumar: You can connect via mobile as well as PC/Laptop.

We can have a trial run. 😅
07/05/20, 12:48 - Zain Asif: Seems fair
07/05/20, 12:49 - Zain Asif: I'll have to use mobile, since my pc doesn't have a webcam

10/05/20, 12:25 - D K: Its alive
10/05/20, 13:16 - Sebin cherotha: I'm still shocked this actually happened
10/05/20, 13:16 - Angad: Yes I am too
10/05/20, 13:16 - Amit Agrawal: Ranjeet did you close the meeting or it just happened to reach time limit ?
10/05/20, 13:16 - Ranjeet Kumar: I closed.
10/05/20, 13:17 - Ranjeet Kumar: Surprisingly there was no time limit for the meeting.

10/05/20, 13:18 - Manoj M: 😂
10/05/20, 13:18 - Amit Agrawal: 😂
10/05/20, 13:19 - Manoj M: It was nice to see y'all and realize you're all still alive on this planet.

10/05/20, 13:19 - Amit Agrawal: Did anyone login from office laptop?
Maybe they had corporate account?

10/05/20, 13:21 - Manoj M: 😂
10/05/20, 13:23 - Ranjeet Kumar: I didn't It still says i have basic version. 

And the emailID i used is also the proxy one. So they don't have any hold on my Credit Cards as well. 


I guess we should Thank Zoom for this. Or may be a month later, when i get billed, you can thank me then.
10/05/20, 13:23 - Amit Agrawal: Haha 😂
10/05/20, 14:21 - Bobby Dixit: I think it was me 😋
10/05/20, 15:32 - Ajay sathya: Wtf! Everyone that could grow a beard has grown one! 😂

Authorities have reserved rooms in 18 hotels, lodges and six hostels for the mandated two-week quarantine.
10/05/20, 17:14 - D K: Saw this in the news
10/05/20, 17:15 - D K: If by any chance of Zain's predictions on our wing doors are left and anyone is placed there is going to get one mother of a fright
10/05/20, 17:15 - Zain Asif: Nah, nothing had plague on it
10/05/20, 17:16 - D K: Still
10/05/20, 17:16 - D K: Its spooky to outsiders
10/05/20, 17:16 - D K: Back cancer
10/05/20, 17:16 - D K: Skin cancer
10/05/20, 17:17 - D K: And whatever you put on Juju and my door
14/05/20, 17:18 - Ranjeet Kumar: <Media omitted>
14/05/20, 17:19 - Amit Agrawal: Damn that is a cold way to fire people 😞😞
14/05/20, 17:20 - Bobby Dixit: 😂
14/05/20, 17:20 - Manoj M: True. but it was cooking up for sometime, if you were following ubers numbers
14/05/20, 17:20 - Bobby Dixit: fucker imagine those people who couldn't even ask a question on why they are let of details etc
14/05/20, 17:20 - Amit Agrawal: Yes

14/05/20, 17:21 - Manoj M: airbnb had 1.9k
14/05/20, 17:21 - Amit Agrawal: Ya around 1900 last week
14/05/20, 17:23 - Manoj M: but the way they went about that, although it had some backlash, the founder was appreciated for the approach. Very thoughtful message and way to let go off people.
14/05/20, 17:24 - Manoj M: https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/
14/05/20, 17:24 - Bobby Dixit: yeah a lot
14/05/20, 17:27 - Amit Agrawal: Maximum customer support people have been fired as per Forbes news
14/05/20, 17:27 - Amit Agrawal: Uber
14/05/20, 17:36 - Manoj M: They're always the first to go down
14/05/20, 17:36 - Manoj M: Observed that at blackbuck as well
14/05/20, 18:51 - Vishal Karve: Dude those were Uber call operators
14/05/20, 18:52 - Vishal Karve: they will fire low performance engineers first
14/05/20, 19:12 - Ranjeet Kumar: Ohh Sorry to hear that.
14/05/20, 19:32 - Bobby Dixit: This message was deleted
14/05/20, 19:40 - Vishal Karve: Abey saale 😜 new joinees haven't had performance evaluation yet
14/05/20, 19:41 - Ranjeet Kumar: So it's a case of null and 0 then. 😂
14/05/20, 19:41 - Manoj M: phew. bal bal bach gaya lounda :p
14/05/20, 19:43 - Amit Agrawal: But they were telling you to watch tutorials on customer support as well 

Now you can do both jobs as customer support people are fired 😂
14/05/20, 19:44 - Ranjeet Kumar: So when our Uber Driver is lost in finding location, we will keep Vishal's number handy. 😂
14/05/20, 19:44 - Amit Agrawal: Yes 😝😂
15/05/20, 09:15 - Amit Agrawal: Happy birthday Vishal 🥳🍾

19/05/20, 15:16 - Rohit Raj: 😅😂
19/05/20, 15:17 - Zain Asif: Wait, do you need to meet a score requirement to post or have committed too much evil?
19/05/20, 15:17 - Vishal Karve: Pretty sure it's hot potential. It got 4 upvotes within a second before the bot took it down
19/05/20, 15:17 - Vishal Karve: Need karma
19/05/20, 15:18 - Vishal Karve: oh I mean yes
19/05/20, 15:20 - Zain Asif: I'm not really familiar with the karma system. I'd seen a similar thing way back, but that was only for users that had gotten repeated downvotes/reports. I remember wondering how one would recover from that situation if they couldn't post anything
19/05/20, 15:21 - Vishal Karve: New users need to build up either time or karma points
19/05/20, 15:21 - Vishal Karve: Make a new account and just lurk and comment on hot stuff
19/05/20, 15:22 - Vishal Karve: Hot comment is easy karma
19/05/20, 15:22 - Zain Asif: Ah, that sucks... but I guess it makes sense in a _lurk moar, newfag!_ kind of way
19/05/20, 15:23 - Vishal Karve: they just want to prevent ad spam.. this is a good way
19/05/20, 15:25 - Zain Asif: Can new users browse and upvote fresh posts? I remember there being a required minimum of whatever the equivalent of karma was to browse the new posts, essentially moderating the content. Interestingly enough, that's where you can really make upvotes on a hot comment, since it can get there first
19/05/20, 15:31 - Vishal Karve: I just made a new account, I can comment on hot posts and upvote
19/05/20, 15:31 - Vishal Karve: Even new posts
19/05/20, 15:36 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
19/05/20, 15:47 - Vishal Karve: Heheh 😂😂
19/05/20, 15:48 - Zain Asif: Dude's 12, though, so it can't be obvious... gotta kick his ass several times and slip one of these in every so often
20/05/20, 14:36 - Vishal Karve: Yo did you guys also hear that load boom sound? In Bangalore
20/05/20, 14:37 - Vishal Karve: *loud
20/05/20, 14:40 - Amit Agrawal: Nope
20/05/20, 14:41 - Vishal Karve: It's trending everywhere.. apparently heard by people as far as e City and hsr
20/05/20, 14:41 - Vishal Karve: even I heard it
20/05/20, 14:42 - Vishal Karve: https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/heard-loud-boom-bengaluru-officials-are-investigating-what-it-was-124924?amp&__twitter_impression=true

22/05/20, 08:21 - D K: I've used both Dell and HP and Dell's worked better for me. Unless your gaming then maybe Asus
22/05/20, 12:11 - Ranjeet Kumar: Get a Good PC Set Up in that price. With two screens. 😂
22/05/20, 13:05 - Arun Chutiya: With curved screen monitors, Amazon's selling them pretty cheap rn
22/05/20, 13:37 - Ranjeet Kumar: Yeah Ordered Samsung's 24Inch Curved Monitor.

10K.
22/05/20, 14:51 - Ranjeet Kumar: <Media omitted>
22/05/20, 16:39 - D K: We spoke to one of our beneficiaries who is 7th month pregnant and comes from a low income background just to check on her. And she told us, "madam main dua karti hoon ki atleast Eid main mujhe chicken biriyani khane ko mile" as she couldn't afford any non-vegetarian food since the lock-down. And another mother said that she tells her children to keep roza (fasting) so that they can have one full meal atleast in the end of the day.
This stayed with me - we are sufficiently privileged that we can afford whatever we want to eat but many families out there aren't. So, please share this within your contacts and donate whatever you can.
I assure you, 100% of the funds received would be going to these families. It takes just Rs.350/- for one meal for this Eid, it's their festival and they deserve to celebrate even in these times of pandemic.

23/05/20, 08:38 - Manoj M: No idea
23/05/20, 08:59 - Zain Asif: Just write the bloody toefl or whatever... it's easy as fuck. We won't get the requisite proof without some policy change or major hoop jumping. If I remember correctly such a policy was brought up, but not for our curriculum
23/05/20, 08:59 - D K: Really?
23/05/20, 08:59 - D K: I remember there was an inspection
23/05/20, 09:00 - Zain Asif: If it's english proficeincy you want, just write toefl/ielts, whichever is more suitable. Both are ridiculously easy to score the requisite cutoffs in
23/05/20, 09:04 - Zain Asif: That was for NITK specifically, that accreditation stuff... what I was talking about was specifically about english proficiency requirements for course completion in the IITs and NITs
23/05/20, 09:40 - D K: Oh ok

12/06/20, 13:31 - Amit Agrawal: You could be free but need to coordinate with these US people and Ajay
12/06/20, 13:32 - D K: yup
12/06/20, 13:32 - Zain Asif: Start whenever, call ne when it's happening. I'll wake up as long as it isn't like 10 or something... should be okay after 12
12/06/20, 13:33 - Manoj M: true. I was just putting it out for reference in case you folks were considering some other time of the day
12/06/20, 13:38 - Zain Asif: 1200 1300 IST makes the most sense. It'll be early for Ajay... however, if the US crowd is okay with staying up (read: if they haven't changed drastically since college) we could make it a tad easier for Ajay by delaying it a little
12/06/20, 13:40 - Zain Asif: We'll have it relatively easy either way - late morning/early afternoon. Yes this is coming from the same guy that was cribbing about it being too early 5 minutes ago
12/06/20, 15:04 - Ajay sathya: 12 IST is fine! I'll just have to wake up for once before 8:30. 😅
12/06/20, 15:36 - Zain Asif: Well, shit... so much for my last resort🤷🏻‍♂

29/07/20, 20:20 - Amit Agrawal: Ya something like that
29/07/20, 20:21 - Zain Asif: Without separate campuses, I presume... I'd imagine that'd be a signifant infrastructure cost
29/07/20, 20:30 - D K: Yup
29/07/20, 20:32 - Zain Asif: So what exactly is different, then?
29/07/20, 20:41 - Amit Agrawal: They have proposed difference in course content
29/07/20, 20:48 - Sebin cherotha: Huge mistake. Arts education is worthless.
29/07/20, 20:49 - D K: Not Art as in fine art but humanities and social sciences
29/07/20, 20:49 - D K: Especially economics
29/07/20, 20:49 - Sebin cherotha: Even more worthless. And Social science is a math field now
29/07/20, 20:50 - D K: Ya in the Indian education parlance social sciences was under Arts
29/07/20, 20:51 - Zain Asif: <Media omitted>
29/07/20, 20:52 - Zain Asif: Not gonna lie, I wouldn't have minded a course in logic or philosophy as extra credit or something
29/07/20, 20:52 - Sebin cherotha: No what I mean is that only people doing actual work in those fields are guys with stats backgrounds(dubious in the case of social science which just CIA and commie propaganda)
29/07/20, 20:53 - Zain Asif: Social science is largely bullshit
29/07/20, 20:53 - Ranjeet Kumar: Yeah. 

And for those who didn't get this chance in their school, should be taught as a training at work places. 😅
29/07/20, 20:53 - Sebin cherotha: Logic is for fags, nobody can actually use it real life
29/07/20, 20:53 - Zain Asif: It's like an SJW farm or something
29/07/20, 20:54 - Zain Asif: It's probably gonna be one big circlejerk of a class. Philosophy in partucualr
29/07/20, 20:54 - Manoj M: There are schools in bangalore already which has something similar.

My mentors daughter who wrote here 10th boards, had cooking/culinary science as a course 😅
29/07/20, 20:54 - Sebin cherotha: Not the real stuff. I'm not joking the field of social science was literally created.by the CIA
29/07/20, 20:55 - Sebin cherotha: Zain we went to Josephs. You can circle jerk without philosophy
29/07/20, 20:55 - Zain Asif: Ah, the students of social science that I knew, from the Humanities department were super sjwish, I figured that was because of their liberal arts degrees
29/07/20, 20:56 - Zain Asif: True enough... this would simply be a justified case
29/07/20, 20:59 - Sebin cherotha: Your talking about India right. Literally American influence peddling. The old Indian left are literal commies. This all a push to undermine them
29/07/20, 21:00 - Sebin cherotha: *is
29/07/20, 21:02 - D K: No man
29/07/20, 21:02 - D K: Haan yes stats
29/07/20, 21:02 - D K: I agree we need Logic
29/07/20, 21:02 - D K: Apparently under the British it was a subject before the SSC/CBSE era kicked in pre 1960
29/07/20, 21:04 - Zain Asif: Yeah, my great uncle was a proper commie
29/07/20, 21:05 - D K: Wait so what you guys are discussing is curriculum
29/07/20, 21:05 - D K: Thats the next step
29/07/20, 21:05 - D K: Right now NEP only defines structure and policy
29/07/20, 21:05 - D K: Which at least 30,000 feet in the air seems a +ve delta
29/07/20, 21:05 - D K: Lol like most Mallus?
29/07/20, 21:06 - Sebin cherotha: The only thing Indian kids need is reading and writing courses because they fucking suck at it. Other than that they should keep doing whatever they are doing
29/07/20, 21:06 - D K: Thats elem and middle bro
29/07/20, 21:06 - D K: And they need math too
29/07/20, 21:07 - Sebin cherotha: They are already doing math right.
29/07/20, 21:08 - Zain Asif: The school curriculum isn't too bad if taught properly, at least, for ICSE. Obviously, any pertinent updates such as in science and the like need to be applied. College though, could use a bump up
29/07/20, 21:10 - Sebin cherotha: @917795791689 similar things happened in other counties. The reason I'm so suspicious is that this is coming along side increased India/US collaboration like the google deal and shit
29/07/20, 21:11 - D K: Naa
29/07/20, 21:11 - Sebin cherotha: End result is a Walmart in every Indian town
29/07/20, 21:11 - D K: Not even close
29/07/20, 21:11 - Sebin cherotha: Relative to US
29/07/20, 21:11 - D K: Very very very small fraction sees that
29/07/20, 21:12 - D K: Thats another geopolitical conundrum to deal with
29/07/20, 21:12 - D K: So net net your saying that India shouldn't ape the US education system?
29/07/20, 21:13 - D K: In the PISA global test India  is 2nd last across the globe- Math in particular is tatts
29/07/20, 21:13 - Sebin cherotha: Yes not the US public school system. Rich kids here all go to STEM schools and shit
29/07/20, 21:13 - D K: Hmm
29/07/20, 21:13 - Sebin cherotha: They learn math and Mandarin
29/07/20, 21:14 - D K: The private sector is trying to invade rich schools to stimulate STEM learning after Grade 7
29/07/20, 21:14 - D K: But accessibility to beyond the top 1-2% of the economic strata won't happen
29/07/20, 21:15 - Zain Asif: Byjus?
29/07/20, 21:15 - Sebin cherotha: That is the eternal curse of India right
29/07/20, 21:17 - Zain Asif: Wait for piracy to kick in and fix that. Those that want to learn can do so, since most of these are just lessons and not qualified/certified courses.
We'll basically have piracy for paid content or something like nptel, but at the school level
29/07/20, 21:21 - Sebin cherotha: Lol, everyone just keep pirating porn and manga. 99.9 % of the population has to be forced to learn. And even then its hopeless in many cases like yours truly
29/07/20, 21:36 - D K: Them and a ton of others coming in
29/07/20, 21:37 - D K: Hmm
29/07/20, 21:37 - D K: Thats a long long debate
29/07/20, 21:37 - D K: Arey bro
29/07/20, 21:37 - D K: Torrent ke liye people need stable internet and compatible devices
29/07/20, 21:38 - D K: Then whether paid or pirated ka question comes
29/07/20, 21:38 - D K: This is the 1st fighter
29/07/20, 21:52 - Zain Asif: That's what friends are for
29/07/20, 21:53 - Zain Asif: But yeah, unless you are actually interested in learning, you're not gonna bother pirating study material... My case was that for those that do want to learn, there is a way
