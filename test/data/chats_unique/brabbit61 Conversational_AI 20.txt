19/10/2019, 22:54 - Jenit Jain: Damn and dcc?
20/10/2019, 04:41 - Arusha Ellias: Now 🌝
20/10/2019, 05:10 - Jenit Jain: Gg
20/10/2019, 05:42 - Arusha Ellias: How's it going fam
20/10/2019, 08:17 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:17 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:18 - Arusha Ellias: What's going on
20/10/2019, 08:28 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:38 - Jenit Jain: So what's happening in fig a is that after wxa there's a rxa in p2, and we know that rxa will always follow wxa so that's why there's an arrow. 
Then wxb follows rxa, so rxb in p3 follows wxb. But rxa in p4 is independent of the other processes so we can say it's getting it's value from p1's wxa. And the rxb in p4 can follow.  But there's nothing for rxa in p3 because after rxb in p3, we know rxa can't happen (since x=b not a)
20/10/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: And in the figb,
Since there is no reading between writes in p1 and p2 we can say they are happening concurrently
20/10/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: Hence p4 first a and then b
20/10/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: And p3 first reads b then a
20/10/2019, 08:40 - Jenit Jain: Hence figb is casually consistent and a isnt
20/10/2019, 08:43 - Arusha Ellias: So basically you can read from whatever process you want
20/10/2019, 08:44 - Arusha Ellias: Provided you're following the order in your process
20/10/2019, 08:50 - Jenit Jain: Yes
20/10/2019, 08:54 - Arusha Ellias: In monotonic reads you have to show the propogation
20/10/2019, 08:55 - Jenit Jain: Bro I barely remember the chapter that I studied. Send ss otherwise you're just using words I have heard of but don't remember
20/10/2019, 08:55 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:58 - Jenit Jain: In fig a the wsx1 is acknowledged in p2 while wsx2
20/10/2019, 08:58 - Arusha Ellias: Ha so you have to show the propagation no?
20/10/2019, 08:58 - Jenit Jain: Draw arrows everywhere bro :p
20/10/2019, 22:05 - Arusha Ellias: How's it going fam
