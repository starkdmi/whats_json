12/9/20, 10:56 am - Jake Patrick: How are you guys going with assignment 1?
12/9/20, 11:12 am - Jordan O'Meara: Im still stuck on the project idea. I just have no idea.
12/9/20, 11:14 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Morning all
12/9/20, 11:15 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Yea i’ve started on assignment 1, but not to say that im 100% on top of it all
12/9/20, 11:16 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m going to be finishing of the weekly investigative submission first and then focus on the assignment
12/9/20, 11:16 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m doing a interactive nursery rhyme
12/9/20, 11:16 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Not sure if that’ll work
12/9/20, 11:30 am - Jake Patrick: I’ve completed most of the assignment 1 stuff except the project idea and my personality test discussion....I’m worried that I’ll fall behind on the other stuff while stressing about this!
12/9/20, 11:30 am - Jake Patrick: I think we’ll be right as long as we answer the questions
12/9/20, 11:30 am - Jake Patrick: And I think a nursery rhyme is a good idea Sneha
12/9/20, 11:32 am - Jake Patrick: Is everybody doing intro to programming as well?
12/9/20, 11:33 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Sorry my bad got confused for a second. Yea doing both intro to IT and intro to programming
12/9/20, 11:33 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Haven’t started the assignment 1 yet. But I come from a psychology background and im also leaning towards a personality test
12/9/20, 11:53 am - Murray Nesteroff: I’ve done my personal profile and gonna finish off the other stuff this weekend fingers crossed. No idea yet about the project idea lol.

I’m doing prog as well 👍
12/9/20, 12:54 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: luckily i  completed Assignment 1 PDF documentation. now i need to start create webpages and GitHub push and all

12/9/20, 12:57 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Dont worry , Jac... its okey for slow and steady. we will do our best in this weekend 💪
15/9/20, 2:15 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Hows everyone going?
Im still really struggling for a project idea. Especially one I can write 1000 words about 😬
15/9/20, 2:26 pm - Jake Patrick: Hey Jordan, I found it easier once I set out my sections, It’s not so daunting when you just have to write 100 words here and there.
15/9/20, 2:29 pm - Jake Patrick: I also just smashed out dot points and expanded on them to get the word count
15/9/20, 2:57 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah that's true. Planning to have the content done by tonight. So ill give that a shot
15/9/20, 3:00 pm - Jake Patrick: Yeah that’s my aim too, good luck man
15/9/20, 3:07 pm - Jordan O'Meara: You too
16/9/20, 3:54 am - Jordan O'Meara: Done and submitted. If you guys need any help let me know
16/9/20, 3:54 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey jordan
16/9/20, 3:55 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Good on you
16/9/20, 3:55 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Im working on it now as well
16/9/20, 3:55 am - Sneha Sathpathy: A bit confused though
16/9/20, 3:55 am - Jordan O'Meara: Anything I can help you with?
16/9/20, 3:56 am - Sneha Sathpathy: So what do we do with the html pages we create through notepad
16/9/20, 3:56 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Are we meant to then upload it onto github
16/9/20, 3:57 am - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah so I just watched one of the videos Anthony put up. And he walks you though it.

Ill find the link
16/9/20, 3:57 am - Jordan O'Meara: https://tinyurl.com/githubtutes
16/9/20, 3:58 am - Jordan O'Meara: The second video.
16/9/20, 3:58 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Oh thanks
16/9/20, 3:58 am - Jordan O'Meara: One tip.
Make sure any of the HTML files you upload are all lower-case in the file name
16/9/20, 3:58 am - Jordan O'Meara: I have a few capitals and nothing worked until I fixed it
16/9/20, 3:58 am - Sneha Sathpathy: What did you end up deciding on the project idea
16/9/20, 3:59 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Ah ok
16/9/20, 3:59 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Cool
16/9/20, 3:59 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks for the heads up 😊
16/9/20, 4:00 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Im thinking of a app like airtasker, except that people can also advertise their skill set, instead of people just posting jobs they want done
16/9/20, 4:00 am - Jordan O'Meara: Thats really cool.
16/9/20, 4:01 am - Jordan O'Meara: I ended up doing an app to stop procrastination by having another random user tell you to do it so that you are accountable to somebody ha
16/9/20, 4:01 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Like for example programming tutors can advertise their skill set and set their own starting prices as well
16/9/20, 4:01 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Haha love it
16/9/20, 4:02 am - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah that's a good idea
16/9/20, 4:01 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I think i would need that
16/9/20, 4:02 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Alright thanks. Have a nice morning
16/9/20, 4:02 am - Sneha Sathpathy: 😊
16/9/20, 4:03 am - Jordan O'Meara: Thanks. I'm gonna try get some sleep. Planning to do my intro to programming assignment tomorrow. Gonna be a long day ha
16/9/20, 4:03 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I start work at 8am 😅
16/9/20, 4:03 am - Jordan O'Meara: Oof
16/9/20, 4:03 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Good luck with it. Let us know how you go with that one
16/9/20, 4:03 am - Jordan O'Meara: Luckily a day off for me
16/9/20, 4:04 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Enjoy
16/9/20, 2:12 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Hi all - I finished preparing assignment PDF , webpages and all - needs to upload the files to GitHub 🙌
16/9/20, 2:21 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Jordan , Sneha , Jacob , Murray and Ben... let’s finish this task on or before Friday 🙏🏼
16/9/20, 2:22 pm - Jordan O'Meara: If anyone needs help with github or submitting. Just ask. Happy to help if you're unsure
16/9/20, 2:27 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jordan
16/9/20, 2:31 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: I definitely will ask
16/9/20, 3:55 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks guys. Hopefully finish mine tonight
16/9/20, 4:00 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: What information did you include or exclude on the website
16/9/20, 4:00 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Did you create a webpage for project idea
16/9/20, 4:00 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Or just put that information on the pdf
16/9/20, 4:02 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah everything on the website. I did separate pages for everything and linked between them. But I believe you could just do one full page.

I was a bit confused cause i was under the impression the pdf should have everything on it.

But I double checked it Anthony and all you need is name. Student number and links to github and github pages.

Everythjbg else is on the website
16/9/20, 4:03 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok great
16/9/20, 4:03 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks 😊
16/9/20, 4:13 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Well done Sneha
16/9/20, 4:13 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: <Media omitted>
16/9/20, 4:17 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yay thanks 😄
16/9/20, 4:55 pm - Jake Patrick: Hey guys I just finished work, good job with the assignments everybody! I finished my PDF yesterday too and then worked through the github video, so now I just need to transfer my info to HTML and upload
16/9/20, 4:55 pm - Jake Patrick: I should be able to get it done by Friday but I haven’t even thought about the programming assignment yet!
16/9/20, 4:56 pm - Jake Patrick: I have Saturday, Sunday and Monday off work so should be alright
16/9/20, 4:58 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Don’t worry Jake I’m in the same boat! Should have it don’t by Friday the can think about programming on the weekend haha.

Its always fun trying to sneak in uni work around my job! But I’m sure I’m not the only one.

Great job guys!
16/9/20, 4:59 pm - Murray Nesteroff: I think by the time we get to the group assignment we will all be pros
16/9/20, 4:59 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Definitely
16/9/20, 5:17 pm - Jake Patrick: Yeah we got this!
16/9/20, 5:49 pm - Jake Patrick: I just read back a bit, Jordan are you sure about not including the assignment content on the PDF? I was under the impression that everything goes on both
16/9/20, 5:50 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I thought that too. But Anthony said you don't need to.

I might include it just in case though
16/9/20, 5:51 pm - Jake Patrick: <Media omitted>
16/9/20, 5:52 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah maybe will do both then
16/9/20, 5:53 pm - Jake Patrick: I think he mentioned there is like a comment section where you need to upload the doc and to include those details there
16/9/20, 5:53 pm - Jake Patrick: If that makes sense
17/9/20, 1:26 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Hi guys, pls help,
We just wanna push all html file to GitHub and mentions the links in PDF, isn’t it?
17/9/20, 1:26 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Or do we need to design webpages through GitHub?
17/9/20, 1:27 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: I did all my html coding via notepad only. It’s working perfectly
17/9/20, 1:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey Raj, i’ve done the same. Just using notepad. I think it should be fine to upload that onto Github
17/9/20, 1:29 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Sneha 🙏🏼 I got made 🤣
17/9/20, 1:29 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah as long as it's all on github and works then you're all good
17/9/20, 1:32 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jordan. I managed to upload the files , everything on GitHub. 🤝🤝
18/9/20, 12:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey guys, im stuck. For some weird reason my css file is not being recognised
18/9/20, 12:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m seeing a error message
18/9/20, 12:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
18/9/20, 12:50 am - Jordan O'Meara: Can't help you there. I kept it simple and stuck to HTML.
18/9/20, 12:51 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Lol might be have to end up doing that
18/9/20, 12:51 am - Jake Patrick: Yeah I just did HTML as well sorry!
18/9/20, 12:51 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Creating too many dramas this way it seems
18/9/20, 12:51 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks guys
18/9/20, 12:52 am - Jake Patrick: I just finished my HTML then and uploaded to GitHub it feels good!
18/9/20, 12:53 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Good stuff 😊
18/9/20, 12:53 am - Jordan O'Meara: Woo. Nice to get through it
18/9/20, 11:55 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Wow the HTML stuff took longer than I thought. Finally submitted. :)
18/9/20, 11:55 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Congrats!
18/9/20, 11:56 pm - Jake Patrick: Nice, good work!
18/9/20, 11:58 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Great job 👏👏
19/9/20, 12:05 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I submitted both assignments... haa hooo
19/9/20, 12:07 am - Jake Patrick: Well done Raj, I’m going to submit my IT one and then work on my programming one, I have sat, sun and mon free to do it!
19/9/20, 12:08 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Awesome, Jacob
19/9/20, 12:21 am - Murray Nesteroff: Well don’t mate!
19/9/20, 12:22 am - Murray Nesteroff: I’m the same as Jake haha. I’m gonna worry about starting prog tomorrow lol
19/9/20, 12:22 am - Jake Patrick: Yeah hopefully it’s enough time!
19/9/20, 12:24 am - Murray Nesteroff: Yea nah we’ll be right 🙏
19/9/20, 1:00 am - Rajaneesh Nair: You guys are really genius... wont take much time to finish tasks ... I take plenty of time to finish these tasks ..
19/9/20, 1:01 am - Jordan O'Meara: Oof programming is taking some time. I was gonna stay up and get it done now but might do it in the morning before work.
19/9/20, 1:01 am - Jordan O'Meara: Just gotta do the user guide parr
19/9/20, 1:01 am - Jordan O'Meara: Part
19/9/20, 1:02 am - Rajaneesh Nair: spending minimum of 5-6 hrs to catch up your speed!
19/9/20, 1:03 am - Jake Patrick: How long do you reckon you spent on it so far Jordan?
19/9/20, 1:06 am - Rajaneesh Nair: <Media omitted>
19/9/20, 1:08 am - Jake Patrick: Haha I will feel like that after this weekend!!
19/9/20, 1:09 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Ha ha 🤣
19/9/20, 1:09 am - Jordan O'Meara: I know I've definitely spent over 5 or 6 hrs I think.
But most of that was figuring things out and trying things. I could probably redo it in one hour.
Actually I don't know if I will take long to do the user guide I might aswell do it now.
Im working all weekend so I should try get as much done as I can
19/9/20, 1:09 am - Jordan O'Meara: I haven't done the modules for either subject yet.

Or the IIE for programming.
Assignments have been the priority
19/9/20, 1:10 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Wow.. Good one Jordan 👏
19/9/20, 1:10 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Same here Jordan
19/9/20, 1:11 am - Jake Patrick: Yeah fair enough! I think I’ll do the iie quickly first because I’m not really up with if statements
19/9/20, 1:12 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Jacob, in planning to search some YouTube videos for tips and tricks
19/9/20, 1:13 am - Jake Patrick: Good idea Raj I’ll do that
19/9/20, 1:13 am - Jake Patrick: I ordered the text book too but it hasn’t arrived
19/9/20, 1:13 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Java’s eating my brain 🤩
19/9/20, 1:13 am - Jake Patrick: Haha
19/9/20, 1:13 am - Jordan O'Meara: If statements are pretty straight forward once you get used to it.

Just copy and paste an if statement and then change things.

Thats what I did
19/9/20, 1:14 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Oh Jordan... that’s awesome... will save time
19/9/20, 1:14 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I got the book yesterday
19/9/20, 1:15 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I’ll try that
19/9/20, 1:15 am - Jake Patrick: Yeah cool.....did you take all the inputs at once and then out put a story? Or is it like question/answer, new question/answer
19/9/20, 1:15 am - Jordan O'Meara: I've found that just playing around with things in Java has helped me a lot
19/9/20, 1:15 am - Jordan O'Meara: I did like a question and answer type thing
19/9/20, 1:15 am - Jordan O'Meara: Like ask for a name and an age and then printed those things in a sentence
19/9/20, 1:16 am - Jake Patrick: Oh yeah cool that’s how I was hoping to make mine too
19/9/20, 1:16 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Yes 🙂
19/9/20, 1:17 am - Jake Patrick: Well I’m keen to get started tomorrow, so I’m off to sleep, goodnight guys
19/9/20, 1:18 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Good night, Jacob, Jordan  and all ... enjoy your weekend 😊
19/9/20, 1:19 am - Jordan O'Meara: Night all
19/9/20, 10:22 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Morning guys, just read the chain of messages. Good on you Muzzyn for finally getting it submitted. I was meant to finish of last night but I got too exhausted and fell asleep 😅 back onto it this morning i guess
19/9/20, 10:23 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Good morning Sneha... 🤣 same here. Finished all activities yesterday itself and waken up just now 😃
19/9/20, 10:23 am - Rajaneesh Nair: <Media omitted>
19/9/20, 10:25 am - Sneha Sathpathy: 🤣🤣 glad to know i have someone on the same boat as me
19/9/20, 10:27 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I have plenty of time -21 covid19 cases reported in my office and clossed since April !

19/9/20, 10:28 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Keep going
19/9/20, 12:42 pm - Jake Patrick: Does anybody know what the GTerm method “clear” is?
19/9/20, 12:43 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Gt.clear;()
19/9/20, 12:43 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Gt.clear(); I mean
19/9/20, 12:44 pm - Jake Patrick: What does it do though?
19/9/20, 12:44 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Clears the page basicallt
19/9/20, 12:44 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Makes it a blank page
19/9/20, 12:44 pm - Jake Patrick: Oh right, thanks!
19/9/20, 12:49 pm - Jake Patrick: That made everything so much better
19/9/20, 12:49 pm - Jordan O'Meara: 👍
20/9/20, 3:03 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Hi guys ,
Hopefully you had a wonderful weekends and submitted all assignments and IEE03
20/9/20, 3:12 pm - Jake Patrick: Thanks Raj, still working on the programming stuff here! Submitted IT assignment this morning and im still having fun with the programming assignment...almost done the code and then need to do justifications and user guide
20/9/20, 3:13 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Superb, Jacob.. 👏👏 let us know if you need any assistance
20/9/20, 3:13 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: 🤝
20/9/20, 3:14 pm - Jake Patrick: Thankyou!
20/9/20, 3:21 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Nice job Jake! Once you know the coding it’s fun haha. I’m the same just justification and guide left 👌
20/9/20, 3:27 pm - Jake Patrick: Yeah cheers! Good job to you too...Im just struggling to put an image in... I did gt.addImageIcon(“alien.jpg”); and I put alien.jpg in the source folder but then when I run it it just display a white screen!
20/9/20, 3:27 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Try src/alien.jpg
20/9/20, 3:28 pm - Murray Nesteroff: (“src/alien.jpg”)
20/9/20, 3:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Good on you guys. I haven’t been able to complete everything yet. My kids have been a handful. But weekends are like that at our house
20/9/20, 3:28 pm - Jake Patrick: Genius! Thanks muz!
20/9/20, 3:29 pm - Murray Nesteroff: I had the same problem haha. Was doing my head in
20/9/20, 3:29 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Must be stressful!
20/9/20, 3:30 pm - Jake Patrick: That’s tough Sneha, do you still work full time as well?
20/9/20, 3:30 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Hi Muz 🤝
20/9/20, 3:30 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: 😂 yes. Full time work.
20/9/20, 3:30 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: How did you guys go with the IIE03
20/9/20, 3:31 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: We can understand, Sneha . It’s stressful but you are managing it perfectly 👏👏
20/9/20, 3:31 pm - Jake Patrick: Crikey! Wow what a good effort
20/9/20, 3:32 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Same here, Jac ... struggled a lot but found so much fun
20/9/20, 3:32 pm - Jake Patrick: Yeah I’m really enjoying it!
20/9/20, 3:33 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Good on you guys 👌⭐️
20/9/20, 3:33 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Great stuff
20/9/20, 3:36 pm - Jake Patrick: Does anyone know a way to gt.clear everything except your image? So like the writing changes but the image remains?
20/9/20, 3:36 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Nah I’m not sure. Only way I can think is maybe run the same code again after the clear?
20/9/20, 3:37 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Maybe as a work around lol. There’s probably a nicer way to do it haha
20/9/20, 3:38 pm - Jake Patrick: Yeah that’s probably the only option now isn’t it cause we haven’t been taught Another way
20/9/20, 3:38 pm - Jake Patrick: I’ll just add it after each gt.clear
20/9/20, 8:54 pm - Jake Patrick: Hey Muz....according to the assignment doc we should not include folder names when adding images....just use the file name....so you need to drag and drop the image straight to the main project folder and then you can just use the file name
20/9/20, 9:01 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Ohhh
20/9/20, 9:01 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Good spot! I’ll sort that out. Thank you!
20/9/20, 9:02 pm - Jake Patrick: No worries!
20/9/20, 9:10 pm - Murray Nesteroff: All fixed. Thanks again for the save haha.
20/9/20, 9:11 pm - Jake Patrick: No worries, you helped me get an image in there in the first place!
21/9/20, 11:33 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Morning guys, can you please help me out. I struggled to upload my files on github yesterday.
21/9/20, 11:55 am - Jake Patrick: Hey Sneha what went wrong?
21/9/20, 11:57 am - Jake Patrick: I have GitHub linked to my atom notepad and uploaded it all through there, so I mayb be able to help if you are doing it that way, but I’m not really sure how to do it via the website
21/9/20, 12:02 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Hey Sneha, in one of these videos (I think it’s the shorter one) Andrew goes through the process. I was confused at first as well but when he goes through it it’s actually quite straight forward. Pretty much drag and drop.
21/9/20, 4:09 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey so sorry got caught up at work
21/9/20, 4:10 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ve created the repository and dragged my files into that folder
21/9/20, 4:10 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: But i dont dont know what i need to do next
21/9/20, 4:12 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Have you watched the videos muz linked above?
21/9/20, 4:12 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I think so
21/9/20, 4:12 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: There were a couple of videos
21/9/20, 4:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m at work now so not being able to see them but i’ll go home and check them all out again
21/9/20, 4:13 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah go through them when you can. I think it will help
21/9/20, 4:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks Jordan
21/9/20, 4:29 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Also just an FYI, Gayan made an announcement and the due date has been moved to next Monday.

21/9/20, 5:27 pm - Jake Patrick: You know I was wondering that too Jordan, I think Ben is not here
21/9/20, 5:28 pm - Ben Saar: Actually damn good timing in the message there Jake.
Sorry for being MIA all, WhatsApp was not something my phone showed me notifications for as I used it for old work stuff.

21/9/20, 5:32 pm - Jake Patrick: Oh cool
21/9/20, 5:33 pm - Jake Patrick: I’m finding the justifications a bit tricky
21/9/20, 5:33 pm - Jake Patrick: Like working out what code goes with what
21/9/20, 5:33 pm - Jake Patrick: My program runs perfectly but it’s a bit messy
21/9/20, 5:37 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah
Mines the same.
Im pretty bad at the justifications but I figure if I just make sure it all works it doesn't matter if a lose a few points for bad justification

6/10/20, 11:29 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I almost finished that 🙁
6/10/20, 11:29 am - Jake Patrick: yes, it's a lot of work for one person to do 3 topics Raj

6/10/20, 11:33 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I was talking about robotics and machine learning
6/10/20, 11:34 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Autonomous vehicle is yours now 🤣
6/10/20, 11:35 am - Ben Saar: I've been working on the cloud solutions, servers one as well as I mentioned. How many did we actually need in this field though, it was only the 4, right?

6/10/20, 11:36 am - Jake Patrick: yes we need 4 Ben
6/10/20, 11:36 am - Ben Saar: Yeah thought so, have we gone overboard with Raj being a madman/beast?
6/10/20, 11:36 am - Ben Saar: Haha
6/10/20, 11:36 am - Jake Patrick: so Sneha has one, Ben has one, Raj has 3 but has given me one

6/10/20, 9:25 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah same haha
6/10/20, 9:26 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Which i knew would happen.
But presentation is only 10% so I focused on the rest first
6/10/20, 9:26 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Great job guys. We’ve got a talented bunch
6/10/20, 9:27 pm - Jake Patrick: yeah i know, me too....the programming assignment was looming then too

6/10/20, 11:22 pm - Jake Patrick: Hey Raj, I just went through your ML report and fixed up the grammar a bit and changed a few words here and there. Can you please look at it and see if I changed anything important? Especially the third dot point, I may have changed the meaning because I didn't really understand it. You are a good writer!
7/10/20, 8:26 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Awesome... now it’s looks so good . Thank you Jacob 🙂
7/10/20, 8:55 am - Jake Patrick: My pleasure 😊

7/10/20, 5:44 pm - Ben Saar: Feedback is surprisingly detailed though, which is nice to see! Seems as though the markers actually read through everything which is a positive haha
7/10/20, 5:57 pm - Jake Patrick: hey that's great Ben, good on you. Yeah the feedback was actually pretty useful! Good work on the presentation, I wish I had a bit more time to make mine a bit nicer
7/10/20, 6:00 pm - Jake Patrick: How did everybody go with referencing?

Tonight and tomorrow I'm gonna be pretty stuck but after that I'm totally free like Thursday and Friday arvo, plus most of the weekend. I'm happy get the Website together for example :)
13/10/20, 8:20 pm - Murray Nesteroff: No worries Ben. I think you had the highest score for presentation if I remember correct haha. Would be awesome if you could have a go at the website.

I had a look at the interview part seem simple to do the actual interview. There is a document with questions which are pretty good.

Sneha did you want to do your boss? I am more than happy to interview my brother. I feel like I haven’t done enough so far haha.
13/10/20, 8:21 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Also I am actually on leave next week so the more I can contribute before Friday the better.
13/10/20, 8:22 pm - Jordan O'Meara: No stress you've done more than me. I am so behind on everything. Work has been insane the last few weeks.
13/10/20, 9:06 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Hey guys I created a new word doco with interview questions. I added a few extra. Have a look when you can and add or remove what you like :).

13/10/20, 9:16 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I think one of the requirements this time around is to have the CSS file seperate

14/10/20, 12:12 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I have a habit of squinting in photos
14/10/20, 12:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: You know the funniest thing was at work we were testing the facial recognition app and everyone’s biggest fear was what they would look like 😂
14/10/20, 12:14 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣
14/10/20, 12:14 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Haha
14/10/20, 12:14 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: I have millions of phots worth nothing
14/10/20, 12:14 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: 🌞
14/10/20, 12:15 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Oh and there were so many complaints that people’s faces were not getting recognised by the app after COVID... since they gained a whole lot of weight 🤣
14/10/20, 12:17 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: 🤣🤣
14/10/20, 12:19 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Haha yeah. Thats another issue. I've put on a tonne of weight in the last few months. So my more recent photos I don't want to use.
But the majority of the photos I have from when I was doing well weight wise are photos of me at the gym covered in sweat haha.
14/10/20, 12:19 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: 😂😂 im in the same boat. Victorians im sure are dieing for gyms to reopen
14/10/20, 12:20 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Very much so
14/10/20, 12:20 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Jordan, can you share some of your weight through cloud computing or some other technologies. I’m just 47kg only 🤣
14/10/20, 12:20 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: We are now “privileged” to go out of the house for exercise for 2 hours
14/10/20, 12:20 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: 😂😂😂
14/10/20, 12:20 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: What’s your secret raj
14/10/20, 12:21 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: I don’t know . I’m just like Bonsai tree since childhood. No growth 😂
14/10/20, 12:21 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Haha. Wow I've literally put on 27kgs since march.
After losing 35kg since the previous june(-ish)
14/10/20, 12:22 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: I’m jealous 😌
14/10/20, 12:23 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Just eat really bad and do no exercise it'll happen eventually
14/10/20, 12:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hahah im jealous of you raj. Im exactly the same as jordan. Was doing training every morning. Got super fit and then after covid it’s just been down hill
14/10/20, 12:23 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Oh man. I eat like a cow now since Covid season . Nothing happening

14/10/20, 9:27 pm - Jake Patrick: Thanks muz! I dunno 15 minutes is a long time, I reckon that’s great
14/10/20, 9:28 pm - Jake Patrick: I can’t see anything on the assignment instructions that say it should be a certain length
14/10/20, 9:32 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Scratch that. The recording file is corrupt have to do it again haha
14/10/20, 9:33 pm - Jake Patrick: Oh no!

20/10/20, 6:30 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Homepage still needs work
20/10/20, 6:32 am - Jordan O'Meara: Looks great. Is it on github yet? I can work on it while you sleep today if you want

20/10/20, 6:47 am - Sneha Sathpathy: So sorry guys bombarding you with messages 😀
20/10/20, 6:47 am - Jordan O'Meara: Jake posted a github repo on teams. If you go to that you should be able to just upload everything to that I think.
20/10/20, 6:47 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok great
20/10/20, 6:47 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks jordan
20/10/20, 6:48 am - Ben Saar: I'll get the reflection done after work, and as for images I'll have a look and see what I can add into the teams file. Only thing I can think of are few images of the inspirations.
20/10/20, 6:48 am - Ben Saar: So an image of Senua, and maybe an Alice in Wonderland.
20/10/20, 6:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: All good
20/10/20, 6:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m going to head out for work in an hour
20/10/20, 6:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll try my best to get everything uploaded before i go
20/10/20, 6:50 am - Jordan O'Meara: And thanks for sending the messages now so I actually have some motivation to get out of bed instead of going back to sleep ha. Last two nights I've fallen asleep at 8pm when my daughter went to bed and then ended up overstepping. My sleep has been all over the place for weeks for some reason
20/10/20, 6:50 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Hahah
20/10/20, 6:50 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I watched Ozark
20/10/20, 6:50 am - Sneha Sathpathy: That was my inspiration
20/10/20, 6:51 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I think I finished one season
20/10/20, 6:52 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok silly question guys
20/10/20, 6:52 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I have forgotten how to upload the docs on repository
20/10/20, 6:52 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Can you guys please help
20/10/20, 6:53 am - Jordan O'Meara: Gimme a sec to look. Its been a while
20/10/20, 6:53 am - Sneha Sathpathy: 😊 thanks
20/10/20, 6:54 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Im such a idiot
20/10/20, 6:55 am - Jordan O'Meara: Okay so go to the repo and it should have a button with 3 dots at the top right? Click on that and it should say upload files.
20/10/20, 6:55 am - Sneha Sathpathy: It would have helped if i was signed in
20/10/20, 6:55 am - Sneha Sathpathy: 😂😂😂
20/10/20, 6:55 am - Sneha Sathpathy: It says thougg uploads are disabled
20/10/20, 6:56 am - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
20/10/20, 6:56 am - Jordan O'Meara: Mmmm maybe Jake has to do something to allow it.
20/10/20, 6:56 am - Jordan O'Meara: How about make a folder on teams and upload it to there and I'll see what I can do
20/10/20, 6:56 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I reckon he’s got to give access to the other team members to upload things
20/10/20, 6:57 am - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah maybe. 
Put it all in a folder on teams and I'll see what I can do
20/10/20, 6:57 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Let me try
20/10/20, 7:21 am - Jordan O'Meara: Let me know how you go
20/10/20, 7:21 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Ive uploaded whatever i have completed.
20/10/20, 7:22 am - Jordan O'Meara: Awesome ill have a look soon and see if I can get it onto github
20/10/20, 7:22 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks 😊
20/10/20, 7:22 am - Jordan O'Meara: Go sleep
20/10/20, 7:23 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Lol got to go to work
20/10/20, 7:48 am - Jordan O'Meara: How do you survive ha
20/10/20, 7:49 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Switch my brain of thinking about it 😁

20/10/20, 8:00 am - Jake Patrick: Sneha whats your email address for GitHub?
20/10/20, 8:02 am - Jake Patrick: Or username
20/10/20, 8:05 am - Jake Patrick: I found it I think. I actually found two for you, I sent an invite to both so you should have to accept the invite and then have access to the repo
20/10/20, 8:05 am - Jake Patrick: Can everyone post their usernames and I will send invites
20/10/20, 8:08 am - Sneha Sathpathy: s3871459@student.rmit.edu.au
20/10/20, 8:09 am - Jake Patrick: Log in to GitHub and see if you have an invite sneha!
20/10/20, 8:09 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Just on the way to work. Give me an hour or so and i’ll have a look
20/10/20, 8:09 am - Jake Patrick: I think I need usernames, not emails, but I found yours cause you have a photo
20/10/20, 8:10 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I think mine’s snehasathpathy
20/10/20, 8:10 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok cool 😊
20/10/20, 8:10 am - Jake Patrick: No probs, I will be at work then so hopefully you will be able to upload and then others will be able to see it
20/10/20, 8:11 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks jake
20/10/20, 8:11 am - Jake Patrick: If you can send your username in the next half our or so jordan then you can have access too

20/10/20, 8:12 am - Jake Patrick: Thanks for your effort sneha I can’t believe you stayed up all night and then went to work!
20/10/20, 8:12 am - Sneha Sathpathy: We’ve got sufficient time
20/10/20, 8:13 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Na all good. daytime is hard for me and im a night owl anyway 😄
20/10/20, 8:14 am - Jake Patrick: Well good luck today and I hope there is a good coffee machine at work!
20/10/20, 8:38 am - Jordan O'Meara: Mines TheOtherJord
20/10/20, 8:49 am - Jake Patrick: cool, pretty sure i've found everybody except for murray so let me know if you can/can't get it

20/10/20, 9:06 am - Jordan O'Meara: Check you're email you signed up to github with. Invite will be there
20/10/20, 9:21 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Looks so beautiful 😍
20/10/20, 9:28 am - Jordan O'Meara: Currently uploading
20/10/20, 9:31 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I got invitation - thank you Jordan and Jacob 🙏🏼
20/10/20, 9:32 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Hope you find difficulties to type my full name 😃
20/10/20, 9:33 am - Rajaneesh Nair: I’m sick and tired with my name- it’s bloody long -
20/10/20, 9:34 am - Jordan O'Meara: Id love to change my name. Having an apostrophe in it is frustrating. Especially when it comes to IT stuff.

My sisters work email somehow has an apostrophe in it. It only works on their server and if she has to use it anywhere else it won't accept it
20/10/20, 9:38 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Oh... I though I am the only person had trouble with name...  my name has three parts- carries my patents name too

1) Rajaneesh (given name)
2)Sankaran Nair( my dad’s name)
3)Sukumarai Amma( mother’s name)
🤪
My brother carries my parents name and grand father’s name too. It’s look like a metro train
20/10/20, 9:40 am - Jordan O'Meara: Haha i like your name. I am a big fan of South Asian names. They always sound so cool
20/10/20, 9:42 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you so Jordan 😍
20/10/20, 2:21 pm - Murray Nesteroff: Hey guys sorry have been in and out of reception this week. I’ll try and fix up my pic a little later when I get back to the hotel.

Sorry again about the poorly timed week away guys.

Let me know if anything else I need to fix up.
20/10/20, 2:22 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I can try fix the pic for you later if I get a chance
20/10/20, 2:48 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Picture format is fixed.
20/10/20, 2:49 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks guys
20/10/20, 2:49 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey jordan can you push to create the website
20/10/20, 2:50 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I cant remember exactly how to do it
20/10/20, 2:50 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
20/10/20, 2:51 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I think maybe Jake needs to do it cause it's his repo
20/10/20, 2:51 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ah ok
20/10/20, 2:51 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Makes sense
20/10/20, 2:53 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Hi sneha, what you think, my photo formate is ok or do i need to upload another on?
20/10/20, 2:53 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey raj
20/10/20, 2:54 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yours is perfectly fine 😊👍
20/10/20, 2:54 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Superb. thank you, Sneha...
20/10/20, 2:56 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Murray's photo is uploaded and good to go.
Added to about page aswell.


Also I've just posted on teams about the Contribution form. If everyone wants to look and decide how we are splitting
20/10/20, 2:56 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey can some of you edit the pdf. For example- project idea has “i would want” etc
20/10/20, 2:56 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks jordan
20/10/20, 2:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Also we need to have look into referencing and cross check that format is consistent throughout and that each section has two references
20/10/20, 3:00 pm - Jordan O'Meara: References look pretty solid i think
20/10/20, 3:02 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Someone just check that the referencing style is consistent
20/10/20, 3:04 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ill double check.

And so pdf-wise ill go through and change all the I's to theys etc
20/10/20, 3:04 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Then should probably combine all the different pages into one
20/10/20, 3:06 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Actually... Do we need to include our individual project ideas from A1 or is it just Ben's new one that we include.
Or will we include them on separate pages to be safe?
20/10/20, 3:12 pm - Ben Saar: As far as I'm aware, just the one I revised, as that was the "decided upon" project idea we are going with.
20/10/20, 3:13 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Okay cool so no point editing the rest
20/10/20, 3:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yup that’s
20/10/20, 3:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Right
20/10/20, 3:13 pm - Ben Saar: Nope, I have left the project under its own file atm, as I wasn't sure if it would be great just throwing it into the draft page with everything else haha
20/10/20, 3:14 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Im just transferring the info for project idea
20/10/20, 3:14 pm - Ben Saar: Did anyone have a chance to go through it btw?
20/10/20, 3:14 pm - Ben Saar: Okie
20/10/20, 3:14 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: If there could be some pics or videos would be great for us to add on
20/10/20, 3:14 pm - Ben Saar: I'll have a look for some relevant picture ideas
20/10/20, 3:15 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks ben 😊
20/10/20, 3:16 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I had a read. Great job
20/10/20, 3:17 pm - Ben Saar: Awesome, anything to add curiously? It is a bit over 1500 words, but I wasn't sure if we wanted more depth anywhere atm
20/10/20, 3:19 pm - Jordan O'Meara: What are we going with for team name?
20/10/20, 3:20 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Nah i think that should be fine. You did well
20/10/20, 3:20 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Just some pics or maybe a graphical diagram to show the flow would ace it
20/10/20, 3:21 pm - Ben Saar: No clue Jordan ahahaha

And for now I was just thinking of some pics of inspirations. Graphical diagrams can be for Assessment 3 I feel
20/10/20, 3:21 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Whatever you feel comfortable with 😊
20/10/20, 3:22 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Im gonna go through and combine all of the different docs we have into one to be the main pdf if that's cool?
20/10/20, 3:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Perfect
20/10/20, 3:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: That would just avoid updating any changes
20/10/20, 3:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks so much for doing that jordan
20/10/20, 3:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Really appreciate it
20/10/20, 3:24 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Also there is ben’s reflection we need to update
20/10/20, 3:24 pm - Ben Saar: My bad, I added it late haha
20/10/20, 3:24 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Lol all good
20/10/20, 3:25 pm - Ben Saar: Where should I put the images Sneha? Just in the images tab on Teams?
20/10/20, 3:26 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: If you could put it in the images folder thanks ben
20/10/20, 3:27 pm - Ben Saar: Easy, the image of Senua has a reference already, which I may need to add to our thing, and the Joker one I'll create one
20/10/20, 3:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok cool
20/10/20, 3:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Also can you get two references for the project idea section
20/10/20, 3:28 pm - Ben Saar: Yeah I'm grabbing my original ones real quick
20/10/20, 3:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: ⭐️
20/10/20, 3:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Legend
20/10/20, 3:30 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Also reminder for everyone if you haven't already.
Sparkplus needs to be done
20/10/20, 3:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yes that’s me
20/10/20, 3:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks jordan
20/10/20, 3:31 pm - Ben Saar: Same hahaha
20/10/20, 3:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Far out so much to do 😅
20/10/20, 3:32 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Sorry guys, I got a job after 7 months in a bubble wrap making company.and I’m doing the orientation program 😩 sleepy and boring
20/10/20, 3:32 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Just a lot of little things. You guys have the bulk of it done
20/10/20, 3:33 pm - Jordan O'Meara: We have til tomorrow night yeah?
20/10/20, 3:34 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you for your efforts.. I’m bit scared to touch GitHub work , I don’t want to make a mess😂
20/10/20, 3:36 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Especially on this final moments..
20/10/20, 3:43 pm - Ben Saar: Sorry Sneha, I ended u padding references as you were copying them I think hahaha
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Ben Saar: But I just added those 3 to match what I added as examples in the project idea
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: No issues at all. Thank you so much
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ive added the references
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: The images
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Is there a order
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: And where specifically do they need to be inserted
20/10/20, 3:44 pm - Ben Saar: No particular order on the images, but alphabetical for referencing is all I know haha
20/10/20, 3:45 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: This section is nearly done
20/10/20, 3:45 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Now just adding the images
20/10/20, 3:45 pm - Ben Saar: They are all referencing the inspirations, so at least the Joker image and Fight Club should be near there.
The Senua one can be later on to split it up, as it fits under the game mechanics more due to being directly from one itself
20/10/20, 3:45 pm - Ben Saar: Amazing
20/10/20, 4:03 pm - Jordan O'Meara: @61424441545 do you have the image files of the screen shots of your ideal job. For some reason they aren't showing up in the doc
20/10/20, 4:07 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Yes . I’ll add it again in the folder
20/10/20, 4:08 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: It’s in my google drive - give me 10 minutes. I’ll upload
20/10/20, 4:08 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: 🙏🏼
20/10/20, 4:10 pm - Ben Saar: Sparkplus done here... What an odd system for feedback
20/10/20, 4:12 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Jordan, uploaded three images now in Teams
20/10/20, 4:13 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: It is ...
20/10/20, 4:22 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Project ideas is now done. Ready to be uploaded onto github
20/10/20, 4:22 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ve uploaded it onto teams
20/10/20, 4:30 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok group reflections is also now ready with the updates added. I’ve uploaded the lastest copy on teams
20/10/20, 4:30 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah spark plus is odd
20/10/20, 4:30 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Thanks raj
20/10/20, 4:30 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Great work sneha
20/10/20, 4:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok im going to go zone out for a bit. Be back a bit later and finish the rest

20/10/20, 5:28 pm - Jake Patrick: I like your name too Raj, it's unique so it was no trouble to find you! my partner is Chilean and they have similar format to you I think when they carry both parents' names
20/10/20, 5:31 pm - Jordan O'Meara: When you get the chance Jake can you set up github pages for the repo?
20/10/20, 5:32 pm - Jake Patrick: yep ill do that now
20/10/20, 5:32 pm - Jake Patrick: did everyone get access okay?
20/10/20, 5:34 pm - Jake Patrick: Ben, did you get an invite or did I get the wrong BenSaar?
20/10/20, 5:39 pm - Rajaneesh Nair: Thank you Jacob for the invitation.. 🤝🙂
20/10/20, 5:53 pm - Ben Saar: I may not have checked my GitHub haha, give me a minute
20/10/20, 5:55 pm - Ben Saar: Wait, it was an invite in GitHub, right?
20/10/20, 5:56 pm - Jake Patrick: yeah, but not sure if you got an email notification or not
20/10/20, 5:56 pm - Ben Saar: Wrong account id say, BenSaaar is me. Somebody somehow already had BenSaar
20/10/20, 6:04 pm - Jake Patrick: gotcha
20/10/20, 6:05 pm - Jake Patrick: im having trouble setting up pages, keep getting 404
20/10/20, 6:05 pm - Ben Saar: Good ol' GitHub
20/10/20, 6:32 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah just wait it will work eventually

20/10/20, 6:52 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Sorry guys got a bit of a headache. Im going to lie down for a few hours. Finish the remaining tonight.
20/10/20, 6:52 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: What do i need to put in the IT Work - interview section
20/10/20, 6:52 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Do we have a pic of the person interview maybe
20/10/20, 6:53 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Or can we put a audio recording of the interview
20/10/20, 7:33 pm - Jordan O'Meara: If say put the whole transcript and a link to record at the top
20/10/20, 7:41 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: On html?
20/10/20, 7:47 pm - Jake Patrick: <Media omitted>
20/10/20, 7:48 pm - Jake Patrick: It’s doing my head in

20/10/20, 7:56 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ve got 3 sections left to complete:

Ideal Jobs
Industry Data
IT Work

I had put a seperate section for references. But i think that wont be necessary given that we have sufficient
20/10/20, 7:56 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Maybe that page can be put for something else
20/10/20, 7:57 pm - Jake Patrick: as in we need to convert those to HTML still?
20/10/20, 7:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yes . Input the data

20/10/20, 8:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Not sure sorry

20/10/20, 8:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Oh i used notepad++

20/10/20, 9:18 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: All of the ideal job images are under images

20/10/20, 9:32 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Not sure
20/10/20, 9:32 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: But its in the other draft doc
20/10/20, 9:32 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: You could just save that
20/10/20, 9:32 pm - Jake Patrick: that's cool, i'll start with what we have here
20/10/20, 9:33 pm - Jake Patrick: oh yep of course
20/10/20, 9:54 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Jake can you also push through so we get the URL link. Only you have access i think
20/10/20, 9:54 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: That will give a indication of what its looking like
20/10/20, 9:57 pm - Jake Patrick: hang on, im just having a github fight
20/10/20, 9:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Haha
20/10/20, 9:57 pm - Jake Patrick: trying to pull from my editor
20/10/20, 9:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
20/10/20, 9:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Try these steps
20/10/20, 9:58 pm - Jake Patrick: yeah i did that earlier and it still says error 404 when you click it. Jordan says we just need to wait
20/10/20, 9:58 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: The docs are already uploaded by jordan
20/10/20, 9:58 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: That’s awkward
20/10/20, 9:58 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Wonder why that’s happening
20/10/20, 9:58 pm - Jake Patrick: https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository/
20/10/20, 9:58 pm - Jake Patrick: thats the link anyway
20/10/20, 9:59 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ya got that
20/10/20, 10:00 pm - Jake Patrick: i just pushed the ideal job files from my browser and now im trying to work out how to pull them to my editor
20/10/20, 10:00 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hmm 🤔 good question
20/10/20, 10:00 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Not unfortunately the expert here
20/10/20, 10:06 pm - Jake Patrick: getting there i think
20/10/20, 10:09 pm - Jake Patrick: ok i think i lost a bunch of work. not ideal
20/10/20, 10:10 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: All Good
20/10/20, 10:10 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Everything is backed up
20/10/20, 10:10 pm - Jake Patrick: yeah except for what i just did and didnt push
20/10/20, 10:10 pm - Jake Patrick: im trying to find it on my computer
20/10/20, 10:11 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ouch
20/10/20, 10:25 pm - Jake Patrick: got it, phew!

21/10/20, 12:38 am - Jake Patrick: night Sneha, thanks for your efforts
21/10/20, 12:38 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Same to you 😊
21/10/20, 12:39 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Im a still a bit confused about the IT work one
21/10/20, 12:39 am - Jake Patrick: ill have a look, maybe i can use one of the other pages as a template
21/10/20, 12:40 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Ive got the template saved already
21/10/20, 12:40 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll just put it on teams if you want
21/10/20, 12:40 am - Jake Patrick: yeah do that, then it will be good to get it done now
21/10/20, 12:40 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I think we insert the recording and transcript
21/10/20, 12:40 am - Jake Patrick: so we can just finalise tomorrow night
21/10/20, 12:41 am - Jake Patrick: yeah not sure how to do the recording but ill have a go
21/10/20, 12:46 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Yup I’ve uploaded it now in the html folder
21/10/20, 12:47 am - Jake Patrick: thanks yep, got it!
21/10/20, 12:47 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks 😊
21/10/20, 12:48 am - Jake Patrick: no worries, have a good sleep!
21/10/20, 12:54 am - Jordan O'Meara: I will have the pdf done by tomorrow afternoon.
I fell asleep early and umhave woken up with a migraine so there's a good chance ill be having a sleep in
21/10/20, 12:56 am - Jake Patrick: no dramas Jordan rest well, hope you feel better tomorrow. I will be at work tomorrow too, i'm just doing what i can now before i crash out and then hopefully we can finish the rest in the evening
21/10/20, 2:29 am - Jake Patrick: IT Work is done, it's very basic and could probably use a bit of prettying  and a check/edit but the transcipt is there and the audio is working.
21/10/20, 8:03 am - Jake Patrick: Also I think we need to do 400 words of group reflection in addition to our individual work. I will do it today after work unless someone gets a chance today
21/10/20, 8:23 am - Jake Patrick: Also, pages is still showing error. Not sure why I just change ‘Index.html’ to ‘index.html’ so let’s see if that does anything if anyone has any ideas please let me know
21/10/20, 8:23 am - Jake Patrick: I’ll be back around 5-6 tonight
21/10/20, 8:34 am - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah that will help. I think its more case sensitive on github I think
21/10/20, 8:35 am - Jordan O'Meara: Ill have a look when I get on
21/10/20, 8:35 am - Jake Patrick: here's the link again in case anybody wants to check it during the day https://jake-patrick.github.io/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository/
21/10/20, 8:39 am - Jake Patrick: repo link if tht helps https://github.com/Jake-Patrick/IIT-Assignment-2-Group-Work-Repository.git
21/10/20, 9:22 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Has the css file been uploaded
21/10/20, 9:23 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Without the css file it wont work
21/10/20, 9:52 am - Jordan O'Meara: Could be another case sensitive thing
21/10/20, 10:25 am - Jordan O'Meara: Ill check over all the file names and stuff in a minute.
I remember with a1 I had a bunch of stuff that would work fine on my computer but wouldn't work at all on github and it was entirely the fact that some things were capitalised
21/10/20, 10:50 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Should i try from my account
21/10/20, 10:51 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m working from home today 😁 so i can look at things
21/10/20, 11:13 am - Jordan O'Meara: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 11:20 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Font needs to be changed
21/10/20, 11:20 am - Sneha Sathpathy: And i thinking spacing
21/10/20, 11:21 am - Sneha Sathpathy: It looks different when its up on the website that’s why i wanted to see it
21/10/20, 11:21 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks jordan 😊
21/10/20, 11:23 am - Jordan O'Meara: I've also fixed some stuff on the about page. Resized images slightly si they aren't as squished.

For some reason rajs picture wouldn't work but i fixed that.
21/10/20, 11:24 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Great job
21/10/20, 11:25 am - Rajaneesh Nair: Wow.. looks stunning, Sneha and Jordan 🤝🤝
21/10/20, 11:47 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Jordan couple of things need to be changed. There is the references tab in the code. That needs to be removed as we no longer need a seperate section for references
21/10/20, 11:48 am - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll go in and change that
21/10/20, 11:49 am - Jordan O'Meara: Yep. Cool im currently changing the in-text links to hyperlinks
21/10/20, 11:50 am - Sneha Sathpathy: We need to check that there are 9 pages: index, team profile, behavioural test results, Ideal jobs, industry data, IT work, IT technologies, Project Ideas, Group Reflection
21/10/20, 11:50 am - Sneha Sathpathy: Great
21/10/20, 12:06 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Can somebody test the links on the behavioural test page.

I've got two of them that won't load the page yet if you go to the exact website they lead to they just don't work
21/10/20, 12:08 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Where do i do that
21/10/20, 12:09 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Hey jordan i just noticed you changed the name Index.html to index.html. Make sure you change that on all the other pages otherwise it wont connect
21/10/20, 12:09 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Can you push it and make it as a website so that i can see whether its flowing smoothly
21/10/20, 12:11 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah it should be all good.
21/10/20, 12:11 pm - Jordan O'Meara: The index name was the issue earlier. Case sensitive stuff.
21/10/20, 12:11 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok cool
21/10/20, 12:12 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Project idea page should be up and running in a sec
21/10/20, 12:12 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: This section on all the pages need the Index.html changed
21/10/20, 12:14 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yep doing that now
21/10/20, 12:16 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Should all be done.
21/10/20, 12:17 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks 😊
21/10/20, 12:17 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Might just have to wait for it a bit cause seems to be linking to Index at this stage
21/10/20, 12:18 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Also on the ideal jobs page the white background bit doesn't seem to work.. any idea how to fix that?
21/10/20, 12:19 pm - Jordan O'Meara: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:19 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: It seems like the code has been changed
21/10/20, 12:21 pm - Jordan O'Meara: All I did was resize the images slightly. But I think it was like that before I did it
21/10/20, 12:21 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: No all good
21/10/20, 12:21 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:21 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Woo
21/10/20, 12:21 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: It should be looking like this
21/10/20, 12:22 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: What should be do
21/10/20, 12:22 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: It seems somewhere one slight code might be out
21/10/20, 12:22 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: As the same thing has happened on the home page
21/10/20, 12:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll just send some screenshots to give an idea of what it should all have looked like
21/10/20, 12:23 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Home page looks fine to me...
21/10/20, 12:23 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:24 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:24 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:24 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:24 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Is only the jobs page. Ill have a look and see what is different
21/10/20, 12:25 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: IT work I hadn’t touched on but the format was set
21/10/20, 12:25 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:25 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:26 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:26 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: References - needs to be deleted
21/10/20, 12:31 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yep. Thats on my list
21/10/20, 12:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Im here if you need
21/10/20, 12:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Just need to make some changes on the cyber security section
21/10/20, 12:35 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I don't understand why that white bit isn't working for ideal jobs.
Its identical code wise to the version on teams and thats working fine..
21/10/20, 12:35 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Let me have a look
21/10/20, 12:37 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Where is the file located
21/10/20, 12:38 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Github. Ideal Jobs.html
21/10/20, 12:38 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok thanks
21/10/20, 12:40 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Also is there an image file for "run after job.jpg" for industry data page?
21/10/20, 12:40 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yup
21/10/20, 12:40 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Need that uploaded to github
21/10/20, 12:41 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Found it dw
21/10/20, 12:41 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:41 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Should be at the bottom
21/10/20, 12:43 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Could this be the issue for ideal jobs: two images
21/10/20, 12:43 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 12:43 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yep got it going..

Not sure... shouldn't be
21/10/20, 12:44 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Its hard for me as i cant see properly what happens when i make a change
21/10/20, 12:45 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah you've gotta wait a few minutes for it to work.

Do we have a page for IT technologies anywhere?
21/10/20, 12:45 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yup I do
21/10/20, 12:45 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: But i just have to make some changes on the contend of cyber security
21/10/20, 12:45 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Should i add it first and then send it
21/10/20, 12:46 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Okay cool that's the only one left to get onto github
21/10/20, 12:46 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah finish it up first
21/10/20, 12:46 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ill try figure it the ideal jobs thing
21/10/20, 12:47 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Im on the same page
21/10/20, 12:48 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I have a feeling the section dividers have been changed
21/10/20, 12:48 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: That’s why its doing that
21/10/20, 12:49 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’m going to copy the code on my notes and have a look
21/10/20, 12:49 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Then upload a revised version
21/10/20, 12:51 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yup the coding has gone off
21/10/20, 12:51 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Thats a good idea
21/10/20, 12:51 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: And the text formatting has changed
21/10/20, 12:51 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Leave it to me
21/10/20, 12:51 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll fix it
21/10/20, 12:52 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll leave spaces where the images have to be inserted so that we aren’t double dipping
21/10/20, 12:57 pm - Jordan O'Meara: The references link has been removed from all current pages
21/10/20, 12:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Great
21/10/20, 12:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks
21/10/20, 1:14 pm - Jordan O'Meara: And pdf is basically ready to go.
Just need to copy and paste a few changes from the final site once its all done.
21/10/20, 1:15 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Gonna take a break and then I'll work on the "tools" stuff.

Links to meetings etc.
21/10/20, 1:15 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I still have to upload the IT technologies
21/10/20, 1:15 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: And im working on the Ideal job
21/10/20, 1:15 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks jordan
21/10/20, 1:16 pm - Jordan O'Meara: All good.
21/10/20, 1:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok so this has got to do with the name change from Index.html to index.html
21/10/20, 1:31 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: It’s not being able to comprehend the connect
21/10/20, 1:32 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Because the css file  recognises Index rather than index
21/10/20, 1:33 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ahhhh. Weird... thats odd
21/10/20, 1:33 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Cause yeah it needs to be index or the main page won't work
21/10/20, 1:33 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: So basically i’ll change it from my end here
21/10/20, 1:34 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ok cool hopefully it works
21/10/20, 1:34 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll upload the index again
21/10/20, 1:34 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Funny thing is
21/10/20, 1:34 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: It shouldn’t have needed to be changed
21/10/20, 1:35 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: As it was already in lower case
21/10/20, 1:35 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Code is weird like that sometimes. Reminds me of some of the issues im having in programming
21/10/20, 1:35 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I just went to change the file name and its all in lower case
21/10/20, 1:36 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: 😅
21/10/20, 1:37 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Sorry by bad it was a different file
21/10/20, 1:37 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Weird.. worst case scenario. We leave it and potentially lose one point?
21/10/20, 1:37 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll upload it again
21/10/20, 1:53 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ok ive uploaded the revised index file
21/10/20, 2:02 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Jordan i cant figure out why ideal jobs - formatting keeps breaking. I think it may be to do with the images
21/10/20, 2:03 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Very strange. Leave it for now.
Might just try re do the whole page
21/10/20, 2:03 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ redoing the page
21/10/20, 2:03 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I will leave the part with the images
21/10/20, 2:03 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Okay cool
21/10/20, 2:05 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I have a slight suspicion it’s because the images added later are pretty big
21/10/20, 2:06 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: So it cant handle the dimensions
21/10/20, 2:21 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ahhh.
I might resize the images separately and upload new versions then
21/10/20, 2:22 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Do a version without the images and I'll re do them and see if it works
21/10/20, 2:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Sorry left my phone in the other room
21/10/20, 2:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I was going to say the same thing
21/10/20, 2:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: So basically css file has the formatting at 800px
21/10/20, 2:28 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: And the images were quite big
21/10/20, 2:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Which is my i think it was breaking the format
21/10/20, 2:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll upload the file of ideal jobs up til there wasn’t any issues
21/10/20, 2:29 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Jordan please can you have a look
21/10/20, 2:33 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ill look into it
21/10/20, 2:34 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I think i got it
21/10/20, 2:35 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Each image had a border
21/10/20, 2:35 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Oh?
21/10/20, 2:35 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yup so when for example jake put in two pics that would have broken the formatt
21/10/20, 2:36 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Give me a bit longer. I’ll try from my side to put in most of the data and you can put in the images
21/10/20, 2:40 pm - Jordan O'Meara: All good.
21/10/20, 2:41 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Jordan the border was definitely the issue 😊
21/10/20, 2:55 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Oh cool. I was about to say.
We have 9hrs to go to get this done. So if we can't fix it then let's concentrate on getting the rest done
21/10/20, 2:56 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: 😅
21/10/20, 2:56 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Nearly done. Its all fine
21/10/20, 2:57 pm - Jordan O'Meara: 👍
21/10/20, 2:57 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Just insert the images where its missing but other than that its looking good
21/10/20, 3:00 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Okay cool.
21/10/20, 3:01 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Let me know when it's on github and I'll have a look
21/10/20, 3:02 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I’ll put it on teams in a min

21/10/20, 4:41 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Thanks champ
21/10/20, 4:42 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I was going to say the same
21/10/20, 4:42 pm - Jordan O'Meara: I did very little for the last few weeks and you guys smashed up out. I wouldn't feel comfortable having the same percentage as you guys
21/10/20, 4:43 pm - Jordan O'Meara: It looks like a big drop but split amongst 5 others its not much
21/10/20, 4:43 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Lol 😂 put that in the notes.
21/10/20, 4:45 pm - Ben Saar: As long as you're happy, I'll download it and sign now
21/10/20, 4:46 pm - Jordan O'Meara: 👍
21/10/20, 4:46 pm - Jordan O'Meara: And we did check that only 1 member needs to submit yeah?

21/10/20, 4:49 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Awesome
21/10/20, 4:51 pm - Ben Saar: I go to use the sign feature within Adobe and the entire document breaks on me lol
21/10/20, 4:51 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Strange I just opened in my browser and it worked
21/10/20, 4:51 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Try that
21/10/20, 4:52 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Other option is people can send me a picture of their signature and I can try copy it? If that's not too dodgy for you
21/10/20, 4:54 pm - Ben Saar: That worked fine in the browser. I was trying to use Adobe readers actual signifier function
21/10/20, 4:54 pm - Ben Saar: It didn't like that haha
21/10/20, 4:54 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Cool. As long as everyone gets it done before later tonight

21/10/20, 5:35 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yep got both on the go.

We didn't really keep as much track of the meeting agendas as we should have.

But I'm gonna try bulk it up as much as possible.

But it is only 5 points for that whole side of things so if its not perfect it'll be one or two points.
21/10/20, 5:37 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Meeting agenda is easy to make
21/10/20, 5:37 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Reaching home
21/10/20, 5:37 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah I'm just gonna go through and write down what was said basically
21/10/20, 5:37 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Great
21/10/20, 5:38 pm - Jake Patrick: Wonderful.
21/10/20, 5:38 pm - Jake Patrick: Should I write the group reflection or has somebody done that too?
21/10/20, 5:39 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Yea jake if you could please
21/10/20, 5:42 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yes that's the one thing I think.
Maybe mention that we should have maybe got on github earlier
21/10/20, 5:51 pm - Jake Patrick: Yep sure, it’s a good point! Seems like we underestimated the task
21/10/20, 5:59 pm - Jake Patrick: So Ill be working on reflections, spark feedback and anything else that is needing attention still?
21/10/20, 5:59 pm - Jake Patrick: Thanks for your work today sneha and Jordan and sorry if I broke stuff in your code sneha!
21/10/20, 6:00 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Maybe just have a look through the website and make sure nothing is broken

21/10/20, 6:13 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Strange
21/10/20, 6:13 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Not sure how or why the images are off centre though...

Could be a css thing.

Cause all the image parts were basically copy and paste from the two that are centred
21/10/20, 6:14 pm - Jordan O'Meara: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 6:14 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: I know what’s up with the images
21/10/20, 6:15 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: The have to be coded on the top section

21/10/20, 6:32 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: The images need to be within the <div id=“main”>
21/10/20, 6:33 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: That will center the image
21/10/20, 6:36 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ah
21/10/20, 6:41 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Done
21/10/20, 6:42 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Awesome 😎

21/10/20, 6:43 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Im terrible with fonts so im not making a choice on that

21/10/20, 7:02 pm - Jake Patrick: No, I’m doing the group reflection still, so go ahead
21/10/20, 7:03 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: No worries
21/10/20, 7:03 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Can someone just give me dates when we had meetings

21/10/20, 7:06 pm - Jordan O'Meara: We don't have a recording for one soo?
21/10/20, 7:06 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: We didn’t have that many official meetings as we so regularly
21/10/20, 7:06 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Ah ok
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Jake Patrick: Should we supplement it with our WhatsApp chat?
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah. Yeah I'm gonna put this in once we are done
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Absolutely
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Jake Patrick: We will do better next time with teams
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Jake Patrick: I’m including all that in the reflections
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: As we have constantly been on contact through whatsapp
21/10/20, 7:09 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Great
21/10/20, 7:10 pm - Jake Patrick: Any other key points you want me to address that wasn’t in your individual reflections?
21/10/20, 7:10 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Probably a good idea for us to have a read through the criteria and stuff to check if we've missed anything
21/10/20, 7:10 pm - Sneha Sathpathy: Maybe a line or two that we didn’t have that many formal meetings as we collaborated and constantly kept up-to-date with tasks on WhatsApp
21/10/20, 7:11 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Yeah that's smart
21/10/20, 7:11 pm - Jake Patrick: Yep nice
21/10/20, 7:13 pm - Jordan O'Meara: Ok. I think once the group reflection is done.
And on there. All I have to do is put this convo into the pdf and we are done? Basically
21/10/20, 7:13 pm - Jake Patrick: Beauty
21/10/20, 7:14 pm - Jake Patrick: I’ll read through the instructions after I finish typing
21/10/20, 7:14 pm - Jordan O'Meara: What ill do is upload the whats app stuff to the github and then link to it in the pdf.
21/10/20, 7:14 pm - Jake Patrick: Did we get the it tools section and include everybody’s individual assignment 1 websites?
