5/27/20, 14:37 - AI Derek: TAGCROWD. 

What is it? 

A word cloud program that visualizes text based on the FREQUENCY of words used. 

It‚Äôs the closest we can get to keywording in order to pass ATS. 

How? 

1. Save your ATS compliant resume as Master Resume.
2. Copy/paste into tagcrowd field and press VISUALIZE.
3. Take screenshot of Master Resume tagcrowd and save to Desktop. 

Then for ALL future job applications: 

1. Copy/paste full job description into tagcrowd field and press VISUALIZE.
2. Compare JD visualization to Desktop saved visualization of Master Resume and tweak by add or removing words accordingly. 
3. Send tweaked resume for that specific role. 

Remember: tagcrowd is based on FREQUENCY so some common sense is needed. 

You don‚Äôt need several resumes! 
You just need one that is very heavily focused on Core Competencies and Achievements plus.....


TAGCROWD! 

Link to the program in the comments below, and it‚Äôs FREE! 

I have never shared this tip on LinkedIn 
before, only with clients. 
So use it and share it please. 

Together we can beat ATS! 

*ATS= Applicant Tracking System

5/29/20, 17:10 - ·∏Ñj: Great
5/29/20, 17:10 - AI Derek: Boot camps, data science programs, and online courses tend to focus on training algorithms (which is great!) but they rarely discuss deploying models. Below is a series of 8 articles about ML deployment in production - my reading list for June!

Why it matters: We are moving to a place where doing machine learning means also being able to deploy models into production. This is a lengthy process with lots of pitfalls.

What you'll learn: You won't become an ML engineer just by reading articles but this will help you identify potential weaknesses or gaps you need to address if that's your desired path.

1. What does "deploy" mean? https://lnkd.in/dU8RN8K

6/2/20, 07:49 - AI Derek: So @233554349393 I spoke to Adwoa and she accepted the role
6/2/20, 07:49 - AI Derek: I am of the view that in order for people to succeed in this challenging environment, young people will have to cultivate and imbibe the habit of continuous learning in addition to identifying opportunities.

I have the passion for learning different skills all the time and some how, these skills always contribute to my career journey. Now, I can confidently say I am VERSATILE and people agree with me. 

I hold a Bsc. Agricultural Science degree, a postgraduate diploma in project management and I am currently in my final year MPhil Agricultural Extension. I have worked in the agricultural space for three years and i have gained valuable experience in the areas of entrepreneurship, project management and technology dissemination as a result. I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant where I gathered the skill of research and quick adaptability to changing processes and trends.

Now I am happily a part of Notitia AI team with:

1. A passion for collaborating with people to solve problems from my agricultural field experience. 

2. The administration of training programs in AI for people using communication as a tool from my project management knowledge.

3. The ability to learn and adapt to changing processes and trends in Technology from my research background.

Cofounder and CEO 

When I started in data science,  I had virtually no experience and I was stuck in a number of materials while studying for my master‚Äôs degree in Management Information Systems with no career prospects. 
I struggled to break into the field for months and was just as frustrated as anybody else.
With a lot of hard work, persistence, and experimentation, I was finally able to prove those people wrong, crack the code, and land my first job in the field.

I developed my data science job search strategies over time and eventually became a known name in Data science in Ghana as one of the young people helping students particularly to find interest in Data science opportunities. Along the way mentored and guided hundreds of aspiring data scientists across all levels especially in our universities.

Once I made the transition into data science, I knew I had to share my knowledge to help others start do the same and even do better . It became my mission to help others succeed where I struggled. I worked with number of students on campuses through Ethical AI club and it‚Äôs been fantastic.
With both job seeker and hiring manager perspectives in mind, I worked tirelessly to distill my years of knowledge into the battle-tested Notitia intelligent platform . And since its inception in COVID-19 era in 2020, Notitia platform is positioned to helping aspiring data scientists from my homeland Ghana and the African continent at large to get jobs and develop faster on it.
I believe that it shouldn't be so difficult for curious, hardworking, committed people like you to find a job that you love, and that's why I started Notitia Intelligent Mentoring Program- so that you don't have to go through months or years of heartache like I did or others so that you can have an exciting, fulfilling career and live the life you‚Äôve been dreaming of.

Data science Superpower: Actuarial studies, Strategic thinking, project management and commitment to implementing  ideas.
Favorite Algorithm: Deep Q Reinforcement Learning: I believe that this algorithm has potential to help is leverage the the true machine learning concept.

#1 Favorite Book: Better Angels of our Nature by Steven Pinker 

Motivated By: Constant learning. I strive to be the best I possibly can be so I can make lasting, positive impacts in domains like softwares and Acturial studies 

When not working you are: Reading, chatting and doing Disk Jockeying 
Favorite Movie character: Jack Ryan from Tom Clancy‚Äôs books.

7/14/20, 18:27 - Alex Notitia: Sure.
7/14/20, 18:36 - Alex Notitia: Done.
7/14/20, 18:36 - AI Derek: Nice
7/14/20, 18:37 - AI Derek: When they are almost done with their mentoring program then we roll out the payment part for them to continue
7/14/20, 18:38 - ·∏Ñj: oh okay
7/14/20, 18:41 - ·∏Ñj: @233243319300 how far with the Africa AI Accelerator? Will we take part?
7/14/20, 18:54 - AI Derek: No please
7/14/20, 18:54 - AI Derek: We can look for others once we gain traction
7/14/20, 18:55 - ·∏Ñj: oh okay
7/14/20, 18:55 - AI Derek: @233504782862 and @233249435529 we‚Äôve got to work on this app for taxi drivers in Ghana
7/14/20, 18:55 - AI Derek: And it should be powered by ML
7/14/20, 18:56 - ·∏Ñj: Oh okay
7/14/20, 18:55 - AI Derek: I‚Äôve discussed this with @233554349393 but we can make it more interesting if we are able to think through it
7/14/20, 18:56 - AI Derek: It‚Äôs also going to be an Uber like app 

But we are interested in the security of passengers
7/14/20, 18:57 - AI Derek: So assuming you go to tech junction to pick a taxi going to campus all you need to do is to open your app and make sure you input the taxi car number and your destination on it
7/14/20, 18:58 - AI Derek: And also if you take dropping or stop a taxi anywhere you make sure you input the car number and your destination on it
7/14/20, 18:58 - AI Derek: This is to ensure your own security and to prevent cases of missing items and even robbery by some taxi drivers
7/14/20, 18:59 - AI Derek: The driver will also have his app to get notifications of passengers who onboard his or her car
7/14/20, 18:59 - AI Derek: What do you think?
7/14/20, 18:59 - ·∏Ñj: interesting
7/14/20, 18:59 - AI Derek: It‚Äôs not for charging as in the case of Uber and others
7/14/20, 18:59 - AI Derek: We are interested in Security first
7/14/20, 19:00 - AI Derek: For drivers they can have dashboards that has information on their daily routines and how to maximize their work efficiently
7/14/20, 19:00 - AI Derek: For this I can get a Reinforcement Learning model to do that
7/14/20, 19:01 - AI Derek: By using maps drivers can locate places they can get passengers and where to pass to get them
7/14/20, 19:02 - ·∏Ñj: is there a way we can get a dataset of taxis in ghana corresponding to the car number and driver detail so we use computer vision in the app for users to just scan the plates instead of having to input the car number? for location we can use the geolocation handlers
7/14/20, 19:03 - ·∏Ñj: sure
7/14/20, 19:03 - ·∏Ñj: awesome
7/14/20, 19:10 - AI Derek: I‚Äôll find it

7/30/20, 16:53 - Norbert Notitia: Same as we're doing.
7/30/20, 16:55 - ·∏Ñj: Yeah. But it's relatively quite new and now looking for a team of mentors and all
7/30/20, 16:55 - Norbert Notitia: Yeahhh
7/30/20, 16:55 - ·∏Ñj: We can easily win this space through publicizing our brand
7/30/20, 16:56 - ·∏Ñj: More active social media engagements and pushing our name out there and we'll easily overshadow them
7/30/20, 16:57 - ·∏Ñj: We can also make certain preparations and incentives for our mentees and make our program more desirable than it is now
7/30/20, 17:12 - Norbert Notitia: We're strongly positioned.
7/30/20, 17:12 - Norbert Notitia: We just need to make our first cohort work
7/30/20, 17:16 - ·∏Ñj: Exactly
7/30/20, 17:17 - AI Derek: Oh yh
7/30/20, 17:17 - AI Derek: Everything is set
7/30/20, 17:18 - AI Derek: We should communicate with the students that mentoring officially start on August 1
7/30/20, 17:18 - Norbert Notitia: Sure. We need the timetable.
7/30/20, 17:18 - Norbert Notitia: Share a schedule with them.
7/30/20, 17:19 - Norbert Notitia: @233504782862 can we jump on something
7/30/20, 17:19 - AI Derek: Just break this down and share
7/30/20, 17:19 - ·∏Ñj: Sure
7/30/20, 17:40 - Norbert Notitia: Derek we need a template for some of the things. Like creating a data science career path. So even before they start
7/30/20, 17:42 - Norbert Notitia: Jerry can we work on a needs assessment form where we can assess their needs before the program kickstarts
7/30/20, 17:43 - Norbert Notitia: We need to know their strength weekends, where they want to get to in their data science careers and how we can help them get there
7/30/20, 17:43 - Norbert Notitia: what their expectations are
7/30/20, 17:43 - Norbert Notitia: what tools resources and expertise they will require
7/30/20, 17:45 - Norbert Notitia: If we can create a form and make it available form them to undertake on the platform maybe today. So we can profile them based on their needs and how best to support them throughout the data science journey
7/30/20, 17:48 - ·∏Ñj: sure i'll work on a form tonight
7/30/20, 17:48 - Norbert Notitia: Awesome

7/30/20, 19:36 - Norbert Notitia: Sure.
7/30/20, 19:56 - Alex Notitia: Well, much update hasn't occurred at the core of the dashboard design.
Am compiling a list of features which would be great for us to have on the dashboard.
Once we have some funds available, we can go on and implement those features.
We would have to depend on external tools to fill in the blanks for now.
7/30/20, 22:34 - Norbert Notitia: Cool. How much is needed to do this.
7/30/20, 23:58 - ·∏Ñj: hello guys

7/31/20, 06:42 - Norbert Notitia: Awesome. We need the agile part in the curriculum
7/31/20, 09:39 - ·∏Ñj: Good morning team

7/31/20, 09:45 - AI Derek: Hi all,
 
Hope you are doing well.

We have come up with a new and updated version of the 12 Weeks of Data Science, a study plan, covering everything from basics of Data Science to core concepts, to its applications.
 
This study plan will not only help you learn data science methodically but also help you create a social profile in Data Science communities. In the next 12 weeks, you will work on multiple projects, build a strong Data Science portfolio, have a strong network of Data Science Professionals.
 
YOU will be getting free access to this. 
Please expect us to begin the program with you officially from August 1st, 2020.

We will continue to give you updates on when and we will be having our sessions.

Happy Learning,

Notitia AI
