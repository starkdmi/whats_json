4/29/19, 11:07 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Ya cool
4/29/19, 2:25 PM - Jenit Jain: in uniform search algo, we check if it is a goal state if that is the node that we'll expand next (as it is in the start of the priority queue). We can keep expanding a node continuously down the tree without expanding the other children of the root if the path cost to those children is too high compared to the current node right?
4/29/19, 2:25 PM - Jenit Jain: its not like bfs in which you have to go the sibling before expanding the children right?
4/29/19, 2:26 PM - Sannidhi Cs: We can expand either the children or the siblings of the nose
4/29/19, 2:26 PM - Sannidhi Cs: *node
4/29/19, 2:26 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Depending on which has the lower cost
4/29/19, 2:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool

4/29/19, 4:58 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah, but idk what they mean when they say that stuff "specifies" no intrinsic properties. Does it mean the same thing?
4/29/19, 4:58 PM - Jenit Jain: yeah exactly the definition is the problem
4/29/19, 4:58 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah
4/29/19, 4:58 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Idek what kind of q they will ask from this chap dude
4/29/19, 4:58 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Gotta see old papers
4/29/19, 4:59 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Things is not even defined btw
4/29/19, 5:01 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 5:07 PM - Jenit Jain: we dont have that proving
4/29/19, 5:07 PM - Jenit Jain: havent seen it tho
4/29/19, 5:07 PM - Jenit Jain: they might expect us to like just write about it
4/29/19, 5:07 PM - Jenit Jain: theres a para on optimality of A*
4/29/19, 5:44 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 5:44 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Try this
4/29/19, 5:46 PM - Jenit Jain: okay
4/29/19, 5:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 5:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 5:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 5:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 5:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I'm getting some diff ans for dfs and uniform cost
4/29/19, 5:55 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Bro even a* I have no clue what she's done
4/29/19, 5:56 PM - Jenit Jain: wait for 10
4/29/19, 5:56 PM - Jenit Jain: i'll do and then we'll check
4/29/19, 5:56 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Cool cool
4/29/19, 6:09 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That arrow points from C to F btw
4/29/19, 6:10 PM - Jenit Jain: dfs is also s a g1
4/29/19, 6:11 PM - Sannidhi Cs: But it says dont take the one that loops
4/29/19, 6:12 PM - Jenit Jain: i think its written in the text book that we use explored states so that it doesnt go in infinite loop
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That's for graph search right
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: so when it goes back to A, no other node will be traversed from that A noed
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I guess this is tree search?
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: how is all this diff
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: What do u mean
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Actually in tree search
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: It gets stuck in that loop
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh
4/29/19, 6:14 PM - Jenit Jain: wait divya is confirming
4/29/19, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: okay yeah so according to graph search it should be s a g1
4/29/19, 6:16 PM - Jenit Jain: why are you getting A* diff
4/29/19, 6:18 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah got the same
4/29/19, 6:18 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Took the arrow wrong
4/29/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: so if they havent specified which one (tree or graph ) then do we just assume it to be graph ?
4/29/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: dude if the path cost from S A G1 was less than S A B C G2 then we would consider the first sequence only right?
4/29/19, 6:24 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ok uniform cost also I got the same thing
4/29/19, 6:24 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Looks like no?
4/29/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: haan exactly because i remember he always drew the explored states on the side
4/29/19, 6:25 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yup
4/29/19, 6:25 PM - Sannidhi Cs: So only dfs we're not sure of now
4/29/19, 6:26 PM - Jenit Jain: also in A* algo, once we find a final state, we expand the other frontiers also till the value till that node is greater than the goal state so see if there are more optimal parts
4/29/19, 6:26 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yaa but that's because he solved only uniform cost and a* in class 😂
4/29/19, 6:26 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yep
4/29/19, 6:26 PM - Jenit Jain: bro how is this person even connecting A and C. there is no direct link in the graph
4/29/19, 6:27 PM - Jenit Jain: its a decent assumption so only graph based algos
4/29/19, 6:27 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That's whattt
4/29/19, 6:27 PM - Jenit Jain: eh fuck it
4/29/19, 6:27 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Let's see what divya says
4/29/19, 6:27 PM - Jenit Jain: our dfs is correct
4/29/19, 6:28 PM - Jenit Jain: i didnt send her the question
4/29/19, 6:28 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ohh
4/29/19, 6:28 PM - Jenit Jain: wait i'll ask the dfs
4/29/19, 6:28 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ya ask ask
4/29/19, 6:28 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Because the textbook does not tell us what to do when there's a loop
4/29/19, 6:29 PM - Sannidhi Cs: But for bfs we keep that explored state right
4/29/19, 6:29 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Graph based
4/29/19, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: yes yes
4/29/19, 6:43 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 6:46 PM - Jenit Jain: This is toh 8 puzzle problem
4/29/19, 6:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude in the paper it's written missing info may be assumed according
4/29/19, 6:46 PM - Jenit Jain: So just mention explored states are used
4/29/19, 6:51 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Hmm ok
4/29/19, 6:52 PM - Sannidhi Cs: What do we write under time complexity for each depth?
4/29/19, 6:52 PM - Sannidhi Cs: It's not the asymptotic one right
4/29/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: That only we have to write no
4/29/19, 7:04 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Howw
4/29/19, 7:04 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Asymptotic is when u have infinite modes
4/29/19, 7:04 PM - Sannidhi Cs: *nodes
4/29/19, 7:05 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 7:05 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 7:05 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Same for 2c
4/29/19, 7:05 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Check please 🙈
4/29/19, 7:11 PM - Jenit Jain: This seems right
4/29/19, 7:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Time complexity part ido
4/29/19, 7:12 PM - Jenit Jain: This is I'll check
4/29/19, 7:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Everything is right but what's that 62 thing
4/29/19, 7:28 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That's in case nodes are tested during expansion
4/29/19, 7:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha then yeah sort
4/29/19, 7:29 PM - Jenit Jain: No what plan
4/29/19, 7:30 PM - Sannidhi Cs: How much are u done with?
4/29/19, 7:31 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I did half of 14
4/29/19, 7:31 PM - Jenit Jain: 2 3 12 13 14
4/29/19, 7:32 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll do the rest from divyas notes
4/29/19, 7:48 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ohh why not do the textbook?
4/29/19, 7:49 PM - Jenit Jain: I know those things decent enough
4/29/19, 7:49 PM - Jenit Jain: And Divya reads the text and writes extra notes
4/29/19, 7:49 PM - Jenit Jain: She said it's fine 😂
4/29/19, 7:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ohh 😂😂
4/29/19, 9:13 PM - Jenit Jain: We don't have algos no
4/29/19, 9:21 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Dont think so
4/29/19, 10:09 PM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 10:09 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Dude
4/29/19, 10:09 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Why aren't the values of alpha and beta being passed down the tree?
4/29/19, 10:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah they aren't updating properly
4/29/19, 10:36 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah the scheme is completely wrong 😂
4/29/19, 11:15 PM - Jenit Jain: In objects and categories what does the rectangle and the double rectangle represent
4/30/19, 2:13 AM - Sannidhi Cs: I think double rectangle is for binary relations..
4/30/19, 2:14 AM - Sannidhi Cs: But both are used when the relations apply to individual objects and not categories
4/30/19, 5:48 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Bro we have agent programs?!
4/30/19, 6:40 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
4/30/19, 6:40 AM - Sannidhi Cs: What rule did they use here?
4/30/19, 7:40 AM - Jenit Jain: There's no retune rule as such
4/30/19, 7:40 AM - Jenit Jain: Just normalise so that there probabilities add to 1
4/30/19, 8:00 AM - Sannidhi Cs: How does P(cavity,toothache,catch) = <0.108,0.016>
4/30/19, 8:00 AM - Sannidhi Cs: It should be just 0.108?
4/30/19, 8:08 AM - Jenit Jain: The second probability is for ~ cavitiy
4/30/19, 8:09 AM - Jenit Jain: We include that too to get both the probabilities in a vector format
4/30/19, 8:09 AM - Jenit Jain: They are fusing the above 2 equations
4/30/19, 8:09 AM - Jenit Jain: Also did you even sleep wth
4/30/19, 8:19 AM - Jenit Jain: Also in the water jug problem, you just try to get the answer through intuition through the graph right
4/30/19, 8:29 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah ik
4/30/19, 8:30 AM - Sannidhi Cs: But I thought joint probability gives only one value wtf
4/30/19, 8:30 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Ya lol on and off
4/30/19, 8:30 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Yes there are many solutions
4/30/19, 8:30 AM - Jenit Jain: Man I'll read it again and see. Think if you don't form a vector also it should be fine
4/30/19, 8:31 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Ok cool
4/30/19, 8:31 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Also did u do completeness of resolution and all?!
4/30/19, 8:31 AM - Jenit Jain: Wtf is this
4/30/19, 8:45 AM - Sannidhi Cs: So proof shit
4/30/19, 8:45 AM - Sannidhi Cs: I hope they dont ask all that
4/30/19, 8:46 AM - Sannidhi Cs: *some
4/30/19, 8:51 AM - Jenit Jain: Fuck proofs
4/30/19, 1:17 PM - Jenit Jain: in proof by refutation you prove kb ^ ~ a is a nullset by being false
4/30/19, 1:18 PM - Jenit Jain: and in proof by resolution, you just apply the formula till you get the required 'a' right
4/30/19, 1:28 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I think both are the same?
4/30/19, 1:28 PM - Jenit Jain: No no
4/30/19, 1:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Also Turing test is acting humanly no
4/30/19, 1:46 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yes
4/30/19, 5:11 PM - Jenit Jain: How was it 🙈🙈🙈
4/30/19, 5:29 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Decent
4/30/19, 5:29 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yours?
4/30/19, 5:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell actually da
4/30/19, 5:31 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Actually only, I did one small mistake in alpha beta
4/30/19, 5:31 PM - Sannidhi Cs: And graph part idk
4/30/19, 5:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Same
4/30/19, 5:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Same
4/30/19, 5:32 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ya I pruned one extra
4/30/19, 5:32 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I'm sure of all except dfs
4/30/19, 5:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you get 3 SA G1 and 1 S C G2
4/30/19, 5:50 PM - Sannidhi Cs: How 2?
4/30/19, 7:16 PM - Jenit Jain: You wrote all S A G1?
4/30/19, 7:39 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I didnt get this. Cause u have to trace according to alphabet order
4/30/19, 7:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: First one I got cost 14
4/30/19, 7:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Second 11
4/30/19, 7:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Bfs
4/30/19, 7:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ucs
4/30/19, 7:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Dfs I did tree and graph, graph I got 25
4/30/19, 7:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Last one was 14 I think
4/30/19, 8:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't know
4/30/19, 8:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Eh it's ovet
4/30/19, 8:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Studying ml today?
4/30/19, 8:55 PM - Sannidhi Cs: No dude tomorrow only
4/30/19, 8:55 PM - Sannidhi Cs: U?
4/30/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Duh
4/30/19, 9:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: 😂
4/30/19, 9:13 PM - Sannidhi Cs: There's a looot tho
5/1/19, 12:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Problem for tomorrow
5/1/19, 9:31 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
5/1/19, 9:32 AM - Jenit Jain: It's too early for this arghhh
5/1/19, 9:32 AM - Jenit Jain: But anyay
5/1/19, 9:33 AM - Jenit Jain: You have to do -(log0.5/log2)
5/1/19, 9:34 AM - Sannidhi Cs: You're saying for the conversion to base 10 thing?
5/1/19, 9:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Yeah basically
5/1/19, 9:34 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Bro I entered base 2 only on my calci
5/1/19, 9:34 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Oh wait
5/1/19, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Doesnt this imply log of 0.5 to the base 2 too?
5/1/19, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Rhetorical
5/1/19, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes it does
5/1/19, 9:35 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Got it 🙈
5/1/19, 9:36 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah lol just started
5/1/19, 9:36 AM - Sannidhi Cs: I think I'll do second sessional syllabus today
5/1/19, 2:27 PM - Sannidhi Cs: How much done?
5/1/19, 2:28 PM - Jenit Jain: 0
5/1/19, 2:28 PM - Jenit Jain: You!
5/1/19, 2:29 PM - Sannidhi Cs: 😂😂
5/1/19, 2:30 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I did decision trees 😂
5/1/19, 2:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Woowwww😂
5/1/19, 2:30 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yep
5/1/19, 2:30 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I finally finished this at 1 in the afternoon 😂
5/1/19, 2:31 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm just Netflixing
5/1/19, 2:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Can't fuck around for maths ha
5/1/19, 2:33 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Why we're kinda done studying no
5/1/19, 2:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Sessional 1
5/1/19, 2:39 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Eh
5/1/19, 2:39 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That will take only 1 day da
5/1/19, 2:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: But ok we need to study
5/1/19, 2:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Let's go the library on the first day atleast 😂
5/1/19, 2:40 PM - Sannidhi Cs: If we sit by ourselves we'll chill like how we're chilling now 😂
5/1/19, 2:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude honestly I'm very concerned about maths since only 26
5/1/19, 2:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Please both days library needed
5/1/19, 2:43 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Ok ok 😂
5/1/19, 2:43 PM - Sannidhi Cs: But I think if we study properly we can actually cover syllabus in one day
5/1/19, 2:43 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Let's try
5/1/19, 2:43 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Next day we can solve extra q from textbooks and all
5/1/19, 2:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes yes everything tbu
5/2/19, 12:03 AM - Jenit Jain: How much did you do
5/2/19, 6:09 AM - Sannidhi Cs: I did 9, 2, 7, 15
5/2/19, 6:28 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Wbu
5/2/19, 8:44 AM - Jenit Jain: 15
5/2/19, 8:45 AM - Jenit Jain: I started doing 14th and wasn't u derstanding anything and wasted a lot of time and then I realized I was doing edition 2 not 3
5/2/19, 8:45 AM - Jenit Jain: Rip
5/2/19, 8:54 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Ooohh fuckkk
5/2/19, 8:54 AM - Sannidhi Cs: I was about to do that too
5/2/19, 9:21 AM - Jenit Jain: Are you doing the solved questions from the answer booklet after each chapter!
5/2/19, 9:21 AM - Jenit Jain: ?*
5/2/19, 9:51 AM - Sannidhi Cs: We have to, pakka it will come 🙈
5/2/19, 9:52 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
5/2/19, 9:52 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
5/2/19, 9:52 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Listen most of the stuff in these papers is out of syllabus right?!
5/2/19, 9:55 AM - Jenit Jain: 2b 3c 4a
5/2/19, 9:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Might be out
5/2/19, 10:05 AM - Sannidhi Cs: 2c 4b 3a 3b?
5/2/19, 2:43 PM - Jenit Jain: 4b also not there
5/2/19, 2:51 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Do we have k nearest neighbor?
5/2/19, 2:51 PM - Jenit Jain: i think so
5/2/19, 5:03 PM - Sannidhi Cs: No not there
5/2/19, 5:15 PM - Jenit Jain: cool greatt
5/3/19, 12:04 AM - Jenit Jain: Did you solve any papers
5/3/19, 12:04 AM - Jenit Jain: And did you see all the solved exercises?
5/3/19, 12:51 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 12:51 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 12:51 AM - Sannidhi Cs: <Media omitted>
5/3/19, 12:52 AM - Sannidhi Cs: No dude, will do that in the morning
5/3/19, 12:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Coming early?
5/3/19, 12:48 PM - Sannidhi Cs: No lol
5/3/19, 5:19 PM - Jenit Jain: Humidity no?
5/3/19, 5:42 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Dont know
5/3/19, 5:42 PM - Sannidhi Cs: On what basis did u select humidity?
5/3/19, 5:42 PM - Sannidhi Cs: U calculated information gain and all?
5/3/19, 5:47 PM - Jenit Jain: No I just calculated entropy and selected the lesser one
5/3/19, 5:47 PM - Jenit Jain: That's how you do it
5/3/19, 5:47 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't know if this another method because I don't even know what this is
5/3/19, 6:00 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That's not how u do it
5/3/19, 6:01 PM - Sannidhi Cs: This is how u select
5/3/19, 6:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you get humidity
5/3/19, 6:01 PM - Sannidhi Cs: See same thing has been asked here also
5/3/19, 6:02 PM - Sannidhi Cs: I left this q thinking it was not of syllabus
5/3/19, 6:07 PM - Jenit Jain: LOL
5/3/19, 6:41 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah lol but I calculated the split entropies
5/3/19, 6:41 PM - Sannidhi Cs: So I should get around 3 marks
5/3/19, 6:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Arre you the lesser one is the answer
5/3/19, 6:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Huh?
5/3/19, 6:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: That's not how u do it bro
5/3/19, 6:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: U calculate the entropy of the result
5/3/19, 6:49 PM - Sannidhi Cs: And subtract the entropies after splitting from this
5/3/19, 6:51 PM - Jenit Jain: It's done
5/3/19, 6:52 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Yes lol
5/3/19, 6:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Tomorrow morning 8 library
5/3/19, 6:52 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Math next 😭😭😭
5/3/19, 6:53 PM - Sannidhi Cs: Library opens at 9 j think :/
5/3/19, 6:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Let's by 1
5/3/19, 6:53 PM - Jenit Jain: 😂🙈
5/3/19, 6:53 PM - Sannidhi Cs: 1 in the afternoon uh?
5/3/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: You decide I'll come
5/11/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
5/12/19, 8:58 AM - Sannidhi Cs: 😭😂
5/12/19, 8:58 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Thanks 😂😂
5/12/19, 8:58 AM - Sannidhi Cs: How u been? How's your vacay
5/12/19, 8:58 AM - Jenit Jain: The absolute worst.
5/12/19, 8:59 AM - Jenit Jain: No internship plus after my sister left I basically live at a old age home
5/12/19, 8:59 AM - Jenit Jain: What about you 😂
5/12/19, 8:59 AM - Jenit Jain: Starts tomorrow right?
5/12/19, 9:03 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Ohhh fuckk 🙈🙈
5/12/19, 9:03 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Yeah tomorrow, so today I'm gonna check into this hotel
5/12/19, 9:03 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Courtyard Marriott. They're providing accommodation for a week
5/12/19, 9:04 AM - Sannidhi Cs: First 2 days orientation.

7/9/19, 11:07 AM - Sannidhi Cs: ok lol i thought nikita was good 😂🙈

7/20/19, 12:33 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Yesss
7/20/19, 11:11 AM - Sannidhi Cs: Hello! I'm happy to share that i will also be heading for my masters this year! I had to be hush about it until I got my visa to not affect my chances of continuing work at Microsoft if I didnt - but i got it yday, so i can finally share the news with you all! 
I got acceptances into MS CIS at the University of Pennsylvania, MS CS w/ a data science specialization at USC, and Connective Media Cornell Tech which results in a dual degree of MS Information Systems from Cornell University and MS Information Science from Technion. I was the most excited about Connective media - it lets me specialize in data science, work on problems with companies and build products from the ground up through the two years. My excitement must have shown since Cornell University gave me a partial scholarship too, and that sealed my decision of picking Cornell Tech. 

Also happy to share that last December I had the chance to go to PACLIC, Hong Kong to present a paper on NLP work I did during my 8th sem. This paper has recently been published by ACL!

If any of you are planning on doing your Masters, or want to explore NLP some more, I'm always open to help! 😊
