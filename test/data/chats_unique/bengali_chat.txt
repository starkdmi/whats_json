[03/03/18, 5:59:41 PM] Deeptish: That a large part of adult life
[03/03/18, 5:59:58 PM] Deeptish: Is graduating from the mean to the median?
[03/03/18, 6:00:05 PM] Deeptish: 😝
[03/03/18, 6:28:59 PM] Nirmal Roy: What does that mean🤣
[03/03/18, 6:32:55 PM] Deeptish: Means that the mean was an overrated measure
[03/03/18, 6:33:25 PM] Deeptish: In the real world data is so highly skewed
[03/03/18, 6:33:50 PM] Deeptish: The median gives you a much better feel
[03/03/18, 6:39:05 PM] Nirmal Roy: Always. Mean is a mean bitch. Or transform your data. Or fucking get rid of those outliers. World should be normal and normally distributed
[03/03/18, 6:45:11 PM] Deeptish: Amen

[03/03/18, 7:52:59 PM] Prasid: On a football group, when nirmal uses a box plot to sentiment analysis about general sentiment regarding players, instead of commenting and debating on the results, everyone starts oragsming at the plot/graph
[03/03/18, 7:53:09 PM] Prasid: That is data science for you 😛
[03/03/18, 7:53:53 PM] Deeptish: Haha
[03/03/18, 7:54:10 PM] Prasid: It's too cool for everyone

[03/03/18, 7:54:52 PM] Deeptish: So that's the thing
[03/03/18, 7:55:10 PM] Deeptish: Every time I see people debating on the group over stats
[03/03/18, 7:55:26 PM] Deeptish: I think all you really need is the raw data yourself
[03/03/18, 7:55:39 PM] Deeptish: And you can really shut people up
[03/03/18, 7:55:45 PM] Prasid: Yeah. 😂😂
[03/03/18, 7:56:18 PM] Prasid: People probably saw some cool well visualised graph and went bonkers over it without digging deep into its interpretation
[03/03/18, 7:56:43 PM] Deeptish: To be fair I don't think most people have ever seen a box plot
[03/03/18, 7:57:03 PM] Prasid: Shetai. Looks like capacitors
[03/03/18, 7:57:22 PM] Prasid: In a power diagram

[03/03/18, 8:09:23 PM] Deeptish: Working on a new tool
[03/03/18, 8:09:26 PM] Deeptish: Bibhotsho
[03/03/18, 8:09:30 PM] Deeptish: Looker bole
[03/03/18, 8:11:28 PM] Prasid: Also I realised , when you cluster data based on the median and not the mean, you get a much better cluster quality, which is robust towards outliers.
[03/03/18, 8:11:32 PM] Prasid: But it's NP hard.
[03/03/18, 8:11:32 PM] Prasid: Hence slow.
[03/03/18, 8:11:48 PM] Prasid: What's the tool
[03/03/18, 8:15:17 PM] Deeptish: Looker
[03/03/18, 8:15:36 PM] Prasid: Oh I though you meant the tool is a looker

[03/03/18, 8:16:38 PM] Nirmal Roy: Coursera helps
[03/03/18, 8:16:56 PM] Nirmal Roy: With data science but the real deal lies in the book
[03/03/18, 8:17:09 PM] Nirmal Roy: If we are talking about statistics and not just tools
[03/03/18, 8:17:18 PM] Deeptish: Hmm
[03/03/18, 8:17:21 PM] Deeptish: And experience
[03/03/18, 8:17:37 PM] Nirmal Roy: Yep

[03/03/18, 8:17:54 PM] Nirmal Roy: Which you develop through experience
[03/03/18, 8:18:08 PM] Nirmal Roy: You cannot do random tests on non normal data
[03/03/18, 8:18:19 PM] Nirmal Roy: Transform it , play with it
[03/03/18, 8:18:24 PM] Deeptish: Tools are necessary

[12/03/18, 9:08:36 AM] Prasid: Report?
[12/03/18, 9:08:38 AM] Sourav Sanyal: What is semi supervised ?
[12/03/18, 9:08:46 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Some are labelled ?
[12/03/18, 9:08:49 AM] Prasid: Je ja Khushi bolche
[12/03/18, 9:08:50 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Others are not ?
[12/03/18, 9:09:00 AM] Nirmal Roy: yep
[12/03/18, 9:09:05 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Ooo repost sorry
[12/03/18, 9:09:09 AM] Nirmal Roy: when labeling is costly.
[12/03/18, 9:09:11 AM] Prasid: Bootstrapping
[12/03/18, 9:09:15 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Okay
[12/03/18, 9:09:18 AM] Nirmal Roy: you label few data
[12/03/18, 9:09:31 AM] Nirmal Roy: and use the unlabel data (somehow) for training
[12/03/18, 9:09:45 AM] Prasid: NLP te lage
[12/03/18, 9:09:51 AM] Nirmal Roy: to get a reliable estimate of test
[12/03/18, 9:09:55 AM] Prasid: To learn grammar
[12/03/18, 9:09:59 AM] Prasid: Contexts
[12/03/18, 9:10:04 AM] Nirmal Roy: oshob kata

[12/03/18, 9:10:12 AM] Prasid: Tale dabi ta ki
[12/03/18, 9:10:18 AM] Prasid: Bootstrapping toh baniehi
[12/03/18, 9:10:21 AM] Nirmal Roy: learner
[12/03/18, 9:10:27 AM] Prasid: Where we used the few labelled data
[12/03/18, 9:10:34 AM] Sourav Sanyal: http://koniku.com/
[12/03/18, 9:10:45 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Check this out
[12/03/18, 9:10:48 AM] Nirmal Roy: how did you label the unlabelled training data ?
[12/03/18, 9:10:52 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Bionic chip e
[12/03/18, 9:10:52 AM] Nirmal Roy: just asking
[12/03/18, 9:10:58 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Actual biological neurons
[12/03/18, 9:11:03 AM] Sourav Sanyal: For deep learning
[12/03/18, 9:11:06 AM] Prasid: We learned grammar from the labelled data
[12/03/18, 9:11:07 AM] Nirmal Roy: i am trying to come up with an algorithm
[12/03/18, 9:11:17 AM] Nirmal Roy: arrey bara ki bhabe
[12/03/18, 9:11:18 AM] Prasid: And used the related context information to label some more.
[12/03/18, 9:11:21 AM] Prasid: Kept doing this.
[12/03/18, 9:11:29 AM] Nirmal Roy: what was the algorithm of your learner
[12/03/18, 9:11:35 AM] Prasid: Bootstrapping.
[12/03/18, 9:11:39 AM] Nirmal Roy: or did you use it as a blackbox ?
[12/03/18, 9:12:16 AM] Nirmal Roy: 🙄

[12/03/18, 9:13:38 AM] Prasid: Reinforcement learning?
[12/03/18, 9:13:41 AM] Nirmal Roy: for semi supervised
[12/03/18, 9:13:46 AM] Nirmal Roy: nope
[12/03/18, 9:14:05 AM] Sourav Sanyal: What a boring paper
[12/03/18, 9:14:08 AM] Nirmal Roy: like EM-ing, graph based, co-learning
[12/03/18, 9:14:12 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Only 2 graphs ?
[12/03/18, 9:14:13 AM] Nirmal Roy: etc etc
[12/03/18, 9:14:22 AM] Sourav Sanyal: In a 12 page paper !
[12/03/18, 9:14:30 AM] Sourav Sanyal: No schematics
[12/03/18, 9:14:34 AM] Nirmal Roy: i have implemented EM-ing and graph based
[12/03/18, 9:14:50 AM] Nirmal Roy: but ekta idea ache nijer otao korte chai
[12/03/18, 9:15:12 AM] Prasid: Acha are you talking about the learner teacher paradigm
[12/03/18, 9:15:23 AM] Prasid: Teacher provides some unsolved examples.
[12/03/18, 9:15:31 AM] Prasid: Learner figures out what the label is.
[12/03/18, 9:15:35 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Just butting in
[12/03/18, 9:16:01 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Are you taking about label independent training ?
[12/03/18, 9:17:16 AM] Prasid: Acha
[12/03/18, 9:17:21 AM] Nirmal Roy: kishob bolche
[12/03/18, 9:17:24 AM] Prasid: Before doing some learning.
[12/03/18, 9:17:29 AM] Prasid: You can use the unlabeled data
[12/03/18, 9:17:36 AM] Prasid: To understand more about the dataset.
[12/03/18, 9:17:43 AM] Prasid: And make better prediction

[12/03/18, 9:18:10 AM] Nirmal Roy: yep
[12/03/18, 9:18:17 AM] Prasid: You try to better understand P(D)
[12/03/18, 9:18:32 AM] Nirmal Roy: to better estimate the posterior
[12/03/18, 9:18:34 AM] Nirmal Roy: basically
[12/03/18, 9:18:35 AM] Prasid: Yeab
[12/03/18, 9:18:47 AM] Prasid: Sklearn e ache dekhchi
[12/03/18, 9:18:52 AM] Nirmal Roy: hain
[12/03/18, 9:18:54 AM] Nirmal Roy: but
[12/03/18, 9:19:01 AM] Prasid: But I haven't studied this.
[12/03/18, 9:19:01 AM] Nirmal Roy: nije baniechi matlab e :P
[12/03/18, 9:19:11 AM] Nirmal Roy: hain very advanced MAchine Learning
[12/03/18, 9:19:22 AM] Nirmal Roy: but very important
[12/03/18, 9:19:35 AM] Nirmal Roy: in real world
[12/03/18, 9:19:48 AM] Prasid: Acha I have a question
[12/03/18, 9:19:50 AM] Prasid: Unrelated.
[12/03/18, 9:20:00 AM] Prasid: Do you know about graph clustering?
[12/03/18, 9:20:07 AM] Nirmal Roy: art gallery ja
[12/03/18, 9:20:10 AM] Prasid: Spectral clustering.
[12/03/18, 9:20:11 AM] Sourav Sanyal: I have a question
[12/03/18, 9:20:17 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Do you use tensor flow ?
[12/03/18, 9:20:26 AM] Sourav Sanyal: For your computations ?
[12/03/18, 9:20:30 AM] Nirmal Roy: tensor flow is good for deep learning
[12/03/18, 9:20:37 AM] Nirmal Roy: machine learning e we use our brain
[12/03/18, 9:20:37 AM] Nirmal Roy: :P
[12/03/18, 9:20:42 AM] Nirmal Roy: no libaries required
[12/03/18, 9:20:45 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Ki kotha
[12/03/18, 9:20:46 AM] Prasid: I have used it for a basic network.
[12/03/18, 9:20:46 AM] Nirmal Roy: you can code everything in an hour
[12/03/18, 9:21:19 AM] Prasid: Yeah. I noticed the same thing. Plus you can code up suited to your need.
[12/03/18, 9:21:50 AM] Prasid: Ebar bol. Spectral clustering janish?
[12/03/18, 9:22:35 AM] Prasid: Anyway na janleo jay ashena. Suppose I have a social network graph. And I try to find influential nodes. Does it seem intuitively wiser to cluster the graph and then find nodes in them.
[12/03/18, 9:23:47 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Graph e nodes ki ar edges ki ?
[12/03/18, 9:23:57 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Nodes are neurons ki ?
[12/03/18, 9:24:11 AM] Prasid: You can model anything as a graph.
[12/03/18, 9:24:14 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Ha
[12/03/18, 9:24:19 AM] Prasid: For me. Each person is a node
[12/03/18, 9:24:23 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Tor example tay ki jigges korchi
[12/03/18, 9:24:29 AM] Prasid: And if they are friends on Facebook, that's an edge.
[12/03/18, 9:24:33 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Okay
[12/03/18, 9:25:10 AM] Sourav Sanyal: So influentual nodes are nodes which have more edges connected ?
[12/03/18, 9:25:23 AM] Prasid: Well that's just one of the properties.
[12/03/18, 9:25:36 AM] Prasid: Basically if there's a as company and they want to invest
[12/03/18, 9:25:43 AM] Prasid: *ad company.
[12/03/18, 9:25:51 AM] Prasid: Who should the pay to share their posts.
[12/03/18, 9:26:02 AM] Prasid: So that the add reaches max people.
[12/03/18, 9:26:08 AM] Prasid: *ad
[12/03/18, 9:26:22 AM] Prasid: So it's the node which has a subsequently longer connected chain of nodes.
[12/03/18, 9:26:52 AM] Sourav Sanyal: So you traverse a graph and try to encounter as many "influentual" nodes as possible ?
[12/03/18, 9:27:01 AM] Prasid: Yeah
[12/03/18, 9:27:10 AM] Prasid: Also you don't consider overlaps.
[12/03/18, 9:27:17 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Okay
[12/03/18, 9:27:22 AM] Sourav Sanyal: DAG
[12/03/18, 9:27:28 AM] Prasid: Eg. Shah rukh khan and Gauri khan at both influential.
[12/03/18, 9:27:34 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Direct Acyclic Graphs
[12/03/18, 9:27:39 AM] Sourav Sanyal: *Directed
[12/03/18, 9:27:42 AM] Prasid: But they will likely influence the same set of people.
[12/03/18, 9:27:46 AM] Prasid: You'll not choose both.
[12/03/18, 9:27:51 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Oooh
[12/03/18, 9:27:53 AM] Sourav Sanyal: Achcha

[12/03/18, 9:34:09 AM] Prasid: Ebar bol
[12/03/18, 9:34:14 AM] Prasid: Should I cluster the graph.
[12/03/18, 9:34:46 AM] Prasid: And if I do, then whole finding max influence node, should I keep.count of number of edges that go outside the cluster.
[12/03/18, 9:34:51 AM] Prasid: *while
[12/03/18, 9:35:08 AM] Nirmal Roy: there are a lot of network metrices
[12/03/18, 9:35:16 AM] Nirmal Roy: that tell you if a node is influential
[12/03/18, 9:35:25 AM] Prasid: For now
[12/03/18, 9:35:32 AM] Prasid: I just have connections
[12/03/18, 9:35:35 AM] Prasid: Nothing else.
[12/03/18, 9:35:37 AM] Nirmal Roy: it is one of the basics of network
[12/03/18, 9:35:44 AM] Nirmal Roy: you just need Adjacency matrix

[12/03/18, 9:36:22 AM] Prasid: Of influence.
[12/03/18, 9:36:23 AM] Nirmal Roy: take ego(second degree), clustering coefficient, betweennees, closenes centrality
[12/03/18, 9:36:32 AM] Nirmal Roy: all these metrices tell you if a node is important or not
[12/03/18, 9:36:35 AM] Prasid: Ha ego niechi

I was stunned and petrified they said they see me passing by everday they seemed a bit drunk one of them pushed me agaonst a wall, instanly groped and tugged onto my jeans i couldn't manage anything. I. i could manage a squeal. The other guy said he was gonna fuck the shit outta me. luckily 3-4 people were passing through, probably college students they just shouted like "ei ekhane ki hochhe?" I started crying those 2 guys ran off i broke down. one of them helped me up and walked me outside. helped me get an auto even. i can't even type straight. sorry to bother you like this.

[16/06/18, 7:59:22 PM] Prasid: I can't explain in words. You have to see Bengali art films for that.
[16/06/18, 7:59:28 PM] Nirmal Roy: lol
[16/06/18, 7:59:36 PM] Deeptish: Which is why the greatest thinkers of that time were bengali
[16/06/18, 7:59:39 PM] Nirmal Roy: i think Bombay is too in that sense
[16/06/18, 7:59:46 PM] Nirmal Roy: lot of Brtiish influence
[16/06/18, 7:59:47 PM] Prasid: Watch Anjan Dutta
[16/06/18, 7:59:49 PM] Deeptish: Now all that's left is the colonial hangover
[16/06/18, 7:59:54 PM] Prasid: Trying his best to look British and speak
[16/06/18, 7:59:59 PM] Deeptish: True
[16/06/18, 8:00:02 PM] Deeptish: Ports
[16/06/18, 8:00:04 PM] Deeptish: Borders
[16/06/18, 8:00:10 PM] Nirmal Roy: Anjan Dutta is not your averrage bengali tbh
[16/06/18, 8:00:23 PM] Nirmal Roy: he studied in a boarding school for starters
[16/06/18, 8:00:25 PM] Deeptish: Most of the action in geography and science
[16/06/18, 8:00:26 PM] Nirmal Roy: in darjeeling
[16/06/18, 8:00:26 PM] Prasid: Well but definitely the upstate ones
[16/06/18, 8:00:34 PM] Deeptish: Takes place at interfaces
[16/06/18, 8:00:38 PM] Prasid: The one who have the means to be British, be British
[16/06/18, 8:00:38 PM] Deeptish: Or borders
[16/06/18, 8:00:43 PM] Prasid: Others fantasize
[16/06/18, 8:01:10 PM] Deeptish: All that is mostly gone now
[16/06/18, 8:01:15 PM] Nirmal Roy: anjan dutta's films doesn't represent average bengali thinking
[16/06/18, 8:01:29 PM] Deeptish: Almost all of the people who saw the British directly are dead now
[16/06/18, 8:01:37 PM] Deeptish: +1
[16/06/18, 8:01:46 PM] Prasid: There's a lot of British stuff we inherently respect. Example: people who have cars driven by chauffeur s in white are deemed respectable
[16/06/18, 8:01:58 PM] Deeptish: No longer
[16/06/18, 8:01:58 PM] Nirmal Roy: that;s true everywhere
[16/06/18, 8:02:06 PM] Prasid: Not true everywhere
[16/06/18, 8:02:06 PM] Deeptish: That mentality's changed
[16/06/18, 8:02:18 PM] Nirmal Roy: go anywhere and have a chauffeur you will earn people's respect
[16/06/18, 8:02:18 PM] Prasid: This intense fascination of English language
[16/06/18, 8:02:23 PM] Prasid: And being really good at it.
[16/06/18, 8:02:27 PM] Deeptish: Tui akhon driver wala gari dekhle bolbi chutiya
[16/06/18, 8:02:36 PM] Nirmal Roy: +1
[16/06/18, 8:02:37 PM] Deeptish: But that's necessary
[16/06/18, 8:02:39 PM] Prasid: I know it's changing
[16/06/18, 8:02:57 PM] Prasid: Nexessary to know the language
[16/06/18, 8:03:05 PM] Prasid: Not necessary to be a good writer
[16/06/18, 8:03:12 PM] Deeptish: Know it as well as you can
[16/06/18, 8:03:13 PM] Nirmal Roy: good writer
[16/06/18, 8:03:20 PM] Nirmal Roy: has got nothing to do with British influecne
[16/06/18, 8:03:27 PM] Prasid: I think it does
[16/06/18, 8:03:34 PM] Nirmal Roy: bengalis write better in bengali
[16/06/18, 8:03:35 PM] Deeptish: Good writing is pleasing in any language
[16/06/18, 8:03:43 PM] Nirmal Roy: +1
[16/06/18, 8:03:59 PM] Prasid: I'm saying bengalis picked up better English than the rest
[16/06/18, 8:04:07 PM] Prasid: That has to do with the capital being here
[16/06/18, 8:04:08 PM] Deeptish: Of course
[16/06/18, 8:04:15 PM] Nirmal Roy: yep
[16/06/18, 8:04:16 PM] Deeptish: Of course it did
[16/06/18, 8:04:20 PM] Deeptish: Ke re bhai
[16/06/18, 8:04:33 PM] Nirmal Roy: but doesn't say anything about bengalis fantasising about british way of life
[16/06/18, 8:04:40 PM] Deeptish: More British people were in kolkata
[16/06/18, 8:04:46 PM] Deeptish: Han anywhere else in india
[16/06/18, 8:05:00 PM] Prasid: It does. Not for our gen
[16/06/18, 8:05:01 PM] Nirmal Roy: there's difference between habits you pick up as a direct influence
[16/06/18, 8:05:09 PM] Prasid: But our previous gen , definitely
[16/06/18, 8:05:11 PM] Deeptish: How is that not relevant to people picking up English
[16/06/18, 8:05:25 PM] Nirmal Roy: even my parents gen, i dont see any thing remotely british with my parent
[16/06/18, 8:05:44 PM] Prasid: I think if you take a person from a previous gen and ask where would you wanna go, London, Paris, NyC, etc, they would choose london
[16/06/18, 8:05:58 PM] Prasid: And same with mamatas fascination with London
[16/06/18, 8:06:07 PM] Prasid: And other stuff which I can't articulate right now
[16/06/18, 8:06:12 PM] Prasid: But it's a pattern
[16/06/18, 8:06:41 PM] Prasid: Ask your dad which foreign city he wants to visit first and let me know
[16/06/18, 8:06:50 PM] Nirmal Roy: lol
[16/06/18, 8:06:52 PM] Prasid: Don't get him biased. Ask neutrally
[16/06/18, 8:06:55 PM] Nirmal Roy: Paris
[16/06/18, 8:07:04 PM] Prasid: Jihesh kore bol
[16/06/18, 8:07:07 PM] Deeptish: In my parents I see a heavy mixture of influences.both convent educated but very Bangali middle class.not enticed enough by English education to not enroll their child in a state board school.there.will always be hybrids of influence.
[16/06/18, 8:07:08 PM] Nirmal Roy: New York
[16/06/18, 8:07:14 PM] Nirmal Roy: we have had this discussion long ago
[16/06/18, 8:07:15 PM] Prasid: Give him a few options which includes london
[16/06/18, 8:07:33 PM] Prasid: True
[16/06/18, 8:07:39 PM] Prasid: Okay I was wrong
[16/06/18, 8:07:47 PM] Prasid: Not talking about the avg bengali
[16/06/18, 8:07:58 PM] Prasid: But yeah, English medium educated
[16/06/18, 8:08:00 PM] Prasid: Bengalis
[16/06/18, 8:08:03 PM] Prasid: Obviously.
[16/06/18, 8:08:06 PM] Nirmal Roy: we dont know high end Mumbaikars
[16/06/18, 8:08:09 PM] Nirmal Roy: or Delhities
[16/06/18, 8:08:16 PM] Nirmal Roy: maybe it's the same there
[16/06/18, 8:08:17 PM] Deeptish: You could not have asked a statistically significant number of people.even if you did you could not have stratified the sample correctly.
[16/06/18, 8:08:39 PM] Nirmal Roy: All of India likes the British
[16/06/18, 8:08:43 PM] Nirmal Roy: they came and ruled us
[16/06/18, 8:08:50 PM] Prasid: Incorrect
[16/06/18, 8:08:53 PM] Nirmal Roy: we were in awe of them for 200 bloody years
[16/06/18, 8:08:55 PM] Prasid: We like them more
[16/06/18, 8:09:00 PM] Deeptish: And to the general indian
[16/06/18, 8:09:10 PM] Deeptish: Middle class
[16/06/18, 8:09:12 PM] Nirmal Roy: they showed us stuff we never imagined
[16/06/18, 8:09:27 PM] Deeptish: It wasn't nearly as bad a time as the history books tried to show us.
[16/06/18, 8:09:27 PM] Nirmal Roy: all middle class Indian wants to go 'London'
[16/06/18, 8:09:35 PM] Nirmal Roy: absolutely
[16/06/18, 8:09:46 PM] Prasid: Lol
[16/06/18, 8:09:46 PM] Nirmal Roy: it was brillirant
[16/06/18, 8:09:51 PM] Deeptish: It was horrible for the lower class masses
[16/06/18, 8:10:00 PM] Prasid: Then it was horrible
[16/06/18, 8:10:01 PM] Nirmal Roy: Railway, Sanitation, City extension, Trams
[16/06/18, 8:10:07 PM] Deeptish: And that's why the ultimate champion
[16/06/18, 8:10:11 PM] Deeptish: Was Gandhi
[16/06/18, 8:10:18 PM] Deeptish: Absolutely
[16/06/18, 8:10:26 PM] Deeptish: But then tell me
[16/06/18, 8:10:32 PM] Deeptish: How is it any better now?
[16/06/18, 8:10:38 PM] Nirmal Roy: Hahaha
[16/06/18, 8:10:49 PM] Nirmal Roy: I think it's worse now
[16/06/18, 8:10:54 PM] Nirmal Roy: Since people are suffering
[16/06/18, 8:11:00 PM] Deeptish: Who knows
[16/06/18, 8:11:06 PM] Deeptish: Might be
[16/06/18, 8:11:20 PM] Prasid: Because the lower classes have food clothing and shelter
[16/06/18, 8:11:41 PM] Deeptish: Not true
[16/06/18, 8:11:51 PM] Prasid: Iz tru
[16/06/18, 8:12:06 PM] Nirmal Roy: I think many people still lack the basic amenities needed in today's world
[16/06/18, 8:12:21 PM] Nirmal Roy: Anyway
[16/06/18, 8:12:23 PM] Nirmal Roy: That's different
[16/06/18, 8:12:27 PM] Nirmal Roy: Argument I guess
[16/06/18, 8:13:08 PM] Nirmal Roy: I believe London has this image of being a culture hub
[16/06/18, 8:13:24 PM] Nirmal Roy: And that's why Mamata and co talk about it
[16/06/18, 8:13:48 PM] Nirmal Roy: Because of our affinity towards good culture, which has got nothing to do with British rule I believe
[16/06/18, 8:13:51 PM] Deeptish: Soft power term ta shunechish?
[16/06/18, 8:14:02 PM] Nirmal Roy: Soft boobs shunechi
[16/06/18, 8:14:14 PM] Deeptish: What we're discussing right now
[16/06/18, 8:14:22 PM] Deeptish: It's called soft power
[16/06/18, 8:14:37 PM] Deeptish: The influence of a culture over other cultures
[16/06/18, 8:14:47 PM] Deeptish: USA right now
[16/06/18, 8:15:02 PM] Deeptish: Is the country with the highest soft power by faaar
[16/06/18, 8:15:08 PM] Deeptish: A century back
[16/06/18, 8:15:15 PM] Deeptish: It was Britain
[16/06/18, 8:15:31 PM] Deeptish: USA achieved it through media and the internet
[16/06/18, 8:15:41 PM] Deeptish: England through colonization
[16/06/18, 8:15:50 PM] Nirmal Roy: And Hollywood bro
[16/06/18, 8:15:54 PM] Nirmal Roy: The American dream
[16/06/18, 8:16:01 PM] Deeptish: Media
[16/06/18, 8:16:01 PM] Nirmal Roy: Yeah media
[16/06/18, 8:16:27 PM] Nirmal Roy: They made us believe they helped win the world war
[16/06/18, 8:16:30 PM] Nirmal Roy: 😂
[16/06/18, 8:17:14 PM] Deeptish: USA bhalo desh
[16/06/18, 8:17:19 PM] Deeptish: By and large
[16/06/18, 8:17:36 PM] Deeptish: Has its incentive system right
[16/06/18, 8:17:37 PM] Nirmal Roy: Byapok for education
[16/06/18, 8:17:44 PM] Nirmal Roy: And for the rich
[16/06/18, 8:17:56 PM] Deeptish: Haha
[16/06/18, 8:18:04 PM] Deeptish: I see where this is going
[16/06/18, 8:18:07 PM] Deeptish: 😂
[16/06/18, 8:18:25 PM] Deeptish: The European socialist structure got through to you
[16/06/18, 8:18:31 PM] Deeptish: Speaks to you
[16/06/18, 8:18:51 PM] Deeptish: And it should
[16/06/18, 8:19:02 PM] Deeptish: When it works it does seem like the ideal system
[16/06/18, 8:19:21 PM] Nirmal Roy: Didn't get you
[16/06/18, 8:19:24 PM] Nirmal Roy: Isn't that true
[16/06/18, 8:19:27 PM] Nirmal Roy: ?
[16/06/18, 8:19:43 PM] Deeptish: I don't know
[16/06/18, 8:19:50 PM] Deeptish: If it's true
[16/06/18, 8:19:56 PM] Deeptish: To me it seems ideal
[16/06/18, 8:19:58 PM] Nirmal Roy: I am awestruck by the lack of difference between the rich and the poor
[16/06/18, 8:20:08 PM] Nirmal Roy: In habit and life style
[16/06/18, 8:20:17 PM] Deeptish: There are people who oppose it
[16/06/18, 8:20:30 PM] Deeptish: But I think it's awesome to hear about
[16/06/18, 8:20:30 PM] Nirmal Roy: Maybe the rich has a stable and owns a few horse😂
[16/06/18, 8:20:31 PM] Nirmal Roy: Horses
[16/06/18, 8:20:59 PM] Deeptish: They say in the long run
[16/06/18, 8:21:07 PM] Deeptish: It hampers productivity
[16/06/18, 8:21:22 PM] Prasid: Bhai ekhaneo kono difference nei
[16/06/18, 8:21:25 PM] Nirmal Roy: Which?
[16/06/18, 8:21:25 PM] Prasid: Between rich and poor
[16/06/18, 8:21:33 PM] Deeptish: By reducing incentives for being outstanding
[16/06/18, 8:21:34 PM] Prasid: That's any developed country
[16/06/18, 8:21:40 PM] Deeptish: At something
[16/06/18, 8:22:03 PM] Prasid: Absolutely
[16/06/18, 8:22:11 PM] Deeptish: The Gini index for the American economy disagrees
[16/06/18, 8:22:35 PM] Deeptish: Measure disparity
[16/06/18, 8:22:43 PM] Deeptish: Measures
[16/06/18, 8:23:32 PM] Nirmal Roy: Mhm
[16/06/18, 8:24:00 PM] Deeptish: Europe e income disparity lower
[16/06/18, 8:24:20 PM] Deeptish: But income itself is lower
[16/06/18, 8:24:58 PM] Deeptish: Now which is better depends entirely on your philosophy of life
[16/06/18, 8:25:15 PM] Prasid: Ha otai. Ekhane base is high and rich is shit rich like beyond imagination but even the poor are not disgruntled.
[16/06/18, 8:26:03 PM] Deeptish: The poor will always be disgruntled if you constantly shove it in their faces what it would be like to be super rich.
[16/06/18, 8:26:29 PM] Deeptish: At that point it ceases to be a problem related to your absolute wealth
[16/06/18, 8:27:01 PM] Prasid: But it's not
[16/06/18, 8:27:06 PM] Deeptish: You think in relation to the people who are rich and you start thinking of those as your needs rather than your wants
[16/06/18, 8:27:56 PM] Prasid: Not everyone does that
[16/06/18, 8:28:18 PM] Deeptish: Not everyone does anything
[16/06/18, 8:28:32 PM] Deeptish: Talking about most people

[16/06/18, 8:36:52 PM] Prasid: Sometimes we want consent and not the actual thing
[16/06/18, 8:37:03 PM] Deeptish: Yup

[27/06/18, 12:26:34 AM] Prasid: Maybe clubs have control
[27/06/18, 12:26:38 AM] Prasid: Since they own the player
[27/06/18, 12:26:41 AM] Prasid: Janina
[27/06/18, 12:26:53 AM] Nirmal Roy: Separate contracts

[27/06/18, 12:30:21 AM] Nirmal Roy: Mane do you seriously think Madrid willl send a letter in an envelope or whatever?
[27/06/18, 12:30:26 AM] Nirmal Roy: 😂
[27/06/18, 12:32:39 AM] Nirmal Roy: Eta hoche drama. Kagoj chire dieche and all.
[27/06/18, 12:37:35 AM] Nirmal Roy: A club can have stuff in their contract which says don't play international matches if you are injured or something
[27/06/18, 12:37:45 AM] Nirmal Roy: But if you sign it no one else to blame
[27/06/18, 12:38:14 AM] Nirmal Roy: He's just pissed at Madrid for selling him after being the MoM in UCL final and getting replaced by James
[27/06/18, 12:40:44 AM] Nirmal Roy: Why did the Argentine coach not say fuck off
[27/06/18, 12:41:01 AM] Prasid: Because it's real Madrid
[27/06/18, 12:41:19 AM] Prasid: Their opinion mattered I guess
[27/06/18, 12:41:49 AM] Nirmal Roy: Not to the extent of benching one of your best player in world cup final even if he was fit
[27/06/18, 12:42:35 AM] Prasid: Hmm
[27/06/18, 12:42:46 AM] Prasid: So di Maria is a sore liar?
[27/06/18, 12:43:26 AM] Nirmal Roy: Or just telling a twisted version of the reality.
[27/06/18, 12:43:50 AM] Prasid: Why
[27/06/18, 12:44:08 AM] Nirmal Roy: Still pissed at Madrid for treating him the way they did

[27/06/18, 12:40:03 AM] Prasid: I think it was more diplomatic pressure by Madrid
[27/06/18, 12:45:19 AM] Nirmal Roy: Specially Latin American footballers
[27/06/18, 12:40:18 AM] Prasid: Which convinced Argentine coach that he was not fit
[27/06/18, 12:40:23 AM] Nirmal Roy: What leverage do they have
[27/06/18, 12:45:33 AM] Nirmal Roy: I am not saying Real Madrid is a holy club.
[27/06/18, 12:40:32 AM] Nirmal Roy: On the Argentine coach?
[27/06/18, 12:46:09 AM] Prasid: Oh they are not
[27/06/18, 12:46:39 AM] Nirmal Roy: I am saying they cannot exercise power like that. Would have hit the headline back then itself. I find it hard to believe Argentina coach 'listened' to real Madrid in a WC final
[27/06/18, 12:46:47 AM] Nirmal Roy: None of the clubs are.
[27/06/18, 12:48:26 AM] Prasid: There are a few like Barcelona 😂

[11/08/18, 11:20:04 AM] Nirmal Roy: hoping that for Giroud too xD

[11/08/18, 11:21:09 AM] Nirmal Roy: we only lost Courtois which is not that big an issue

[11/08/18, 11:23:00 AM] Deeptish: I'd like to see a data driven validation of that

[11/08/18, 11:23:40 AM] Nirmal Roy: the world has to take my word for it
[11/08/18, 11:23:42 AM] Nirmal Roy: :P
[11/08/18, 11:23:58 AM] Deeptish: It doesn't make a difference if your defence is solid I guess
[11/08/18, 11:24:09 AM] Deeptish: Norbore defence hole
[11/08/18, 11:24:17 AM] Deeptish: That might become a factor
[11/08/18, 11:24:25 AM] Nirmal Roy: no what i am saying is
[11/08/18, 11:24:42 AM] Nirmal Roy: the difference in quality between the top 10 keepers in the world now is not that much
[11/08/18, 11:25:09 AM] Nirmal Roy: (maybe because all of they have a good defence infront of them)
[11/08/18, 11:25:25 AM] Deeptish: De gea doesn't
[11/08/18, 11:25:50 AM] Deeptish: Nor did Courtois
[11/08/18, 11:25:53 AM] Deeptish: Last season
[11/08/18, 11:26:00 AM] Nirmal Roy: But there's hardly any difference between Oblak, Navas, Allison, De Gea, Courtois etc

[11/08/18, 11:30:24 AM] Nirmal Roy: ofcourse
[11/08/18, 11:30:34 AM] Nirmal Roy: I am speaking holistically
[11/08/18, 11:30:59 AM] Nirmal Roy: I am saying tomorrow if you exchange De Gea with Oblak United's performance won;'t be affected
[11/08/18, 11:32:00 AM] Deeptish: Hmm
