15/10/20, 10:14 - +91 93695 67255: Yeah I can see that too...it says the exam/quiz ended on October 12 , it's because as per the previous schedule the exam  for Course 66th was about to commence from 12-14 October, but later on due to technical issues the dates were rescheduled and were uploaded to the *IIRS Edusat* website but the same wasn't updated to the *IIRS E Learning Exam Portal* so ASAP they'll uploading the notification for next exam date and update the same to *E Learning Exam Portal* also you would be able to appear in it.
