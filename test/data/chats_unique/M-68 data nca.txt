29/04/21, 12:11 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Yeah sure sure
29/04/21, 12:11 pm - Astitv: We can definetely work on more than one ideas one obviously one at a time
29/04/21, 12:12 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: But for working on even a single idea, we have to come up with a conclusion rightüòÇ
29/04/21, 12:16 pm - Astitv: that's what the discussions are for lmao üòÇ
29/04/21, 12:16 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Gg, let's explore bit more
29/04/21, 12:16 pm - Astitv: yep

29/04/21, 2:22 pm - Bodybuilder: Can apply to image in painting
29/04/21, 2:24 pm - Astitv: can apply to simulate CA's as pixel spaces and use them to embed art styles
29/04/21, 2:24 pm - Astitv: maybe even for representing evolutions in CA structures as motion simulations
29/04/21, 2:25 pm - Bodybuilder: CLIP+ NCA
29/04/21, 2:25 pm - Astitv: yes
29/04/21, 2:25 pm - Astitv: a new way of generating animations
29/04/21, 2:27 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeah
29/04/21, 2:27 pm - Bodybuilder: Alt to GANs
29/04/21, 2:28 pm - Bodybuilder: Non adversarial generation of images
29/04/21, 2:29 pm - Astitv: If we can find a way to embed the evolutionary equations of CA's into NN parameters we can basically train it to simulate any animation we want, similar to single-pixel manifold embedding but more general
29/04/21, 2:29 pm - Astitv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12155.pdf
29/04/21, 2:29 pm - Bodybuilder: I know someone did achieve animations using NCA
29/04/21, 2:30 pm - Astitv: generalized animations? paper?
29/04/21, 2:31 pm - Astitv: this one does image regeneration from single pixels using AEs
29/04/21, 2:31 pm - Bodybuilder: I‚Äôll send when on PC in 30 mins
29/04/21, 2:31 pm - Astitv: cool
29/04/21, 2:31 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeah but the arch is too complex
29/04/21, 2:31 pm - Astitv: worth going through tho can provide insights into what more can be done
29/04/21, 2:32 pm - Bodybuilder: Our idea should be take the fundamental apply it in a novel way.
29/04/21, 2:32 pm - Bodybuilder: 100%
29/04/21, 2:32 pm - Astitv: applications of being able to embed CA evolutions in NNs are too many
29/04/21, 2:33 pm - Bodybuilder: Are there any paper explicitly studying applications of CAs?
29/04/21, 2:33 pm - Astitv: not directly in specific fields usually not involving NNs
29/04/21, 2:34 pm - Bodybuilder: https://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/levin/
29/04/21, 2:34 pm - Astitv: I've added all the links to papers that I've gathered in the doc. Maybe go through them and see if you find anything cool
29/04/21, 2:34 pm - Bodybuilder: Can ask A Morvitzev
29/04/21, 2:34 pm - Astitv: haven't had the chance to go through everything myself

29/04/21, 2:35 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeah
29/04/21, 2:36 pm - Astitv: great
29/04/21, 2:36 pm - Astitv: honestly there are too many
29/04/21, 2:36 pm - Astitv: CAs can also be used as alt function approximators with applications in literally every analytic field imaginable
29/04/21, 2:37 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeah what the most influential ones would be
29/04/21, 2:38 pm - Astitv: üëåüèº
29/04/21, 2:39 pm - Astitv: I'll look for papers using CA's as computation structures in pure maths/cs

29/04/21, 2:46 pm - Bodybuilder: His follow up work
29/04/21, 2:46 pm - Bodybuilder: Would love to do something on these lines
29/04/21, 2:46 pm - Bodybuilder: Just simply grow CAs and analyse
29/04/21, 2:46 pm - Bodybuilder: With massive compute
29/04/21, 2:47 pm - Astitv: talk about applications the whole field of simulations is up for grabs lmao üî•
29/04/21, 2:48 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Woah woah! Can somebody give me gist of what did you discuss? I had class going on
29/04/21, 2:49 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Or else, leave it, I‚Äôd just go through the chats
29/04/21, 2:49 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeahh
29/04/21, 2:49 pm - Bodybuilder: Let‚Äôs do something like this
29/04/21, 2:49 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Exactly!
29/04/21, 2:49 pm - Bodybuilder: It‚Äôll be fun I wanna know the results
29/04/21, 2:50 pm - Bodybuilder: Just read this https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/how-the-humble-slime-mold-helped-physicists-map-the-cosmic-web/

29/04/21, 2:51 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: What the f-!ü§Ø
29/04/21, 2:52 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: There‚Äôs this saying that every small thing is interconnected to a very dimensional thing
29/04/21, 2:52 pm - Astitv: It's literal insanity!
29/04/21, 2:52 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Chaos theory being the simplest example
29/04/21, 2:53 pm - Astitv: @919082216009 let's discuss some possible areas where we could simulate stuff and compare that to real world occurrences like they did
29/04/21, 2:53 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeah
29/04/21, 2:54 pm - Astitv: simplest? lmao ever heard of turbulence? simulate that ü§≠ü§≠üòÇ
29/04/21, 2:54 pm - Bodybuilder: Cool
29/04/21, 2:54 pm - Bodybuilder: Lol
29/04/21, 2:54 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: We can do simulations from the cellular world alongwith simulations from the large scale effects, then we can analyse the similarity patterns in the CAs
29/04/21, 2:54 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Lmaoo
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Simplest in the sense to define the common similarity
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Bodybuilder: Yeah that‚Äôs doable
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Astitv: The best part is we can actually see for ourselves how simple systems give rise to randomness and chaotic behaviour and can even help us understand complexity betetr
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Astitv: better
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Bodybuilder: Optimise for large scale runs on TPUs
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Bodybuilder: Yesssss
29/04/21, 2:55 pm - Astitv: We should pick a real world system to model using CA to simulate
29/04/21, 2:56 pm - Astitv: system(s)
29/04/21, 2:56 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: That‚Äôs what na. We can analyse those patterns, who knows we find out some breakthrough similarity
29/04/21, 2:56 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Yass
29/04/21, 2:56 pm - Astitv: eggjectly
29/04/21, 2:56 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes lets study the article and implementation

29/04/21, 3:05 pm - Bodybuilder: It‚Äôs pretty cheap cmon you study @ Manipal lol
29/04/21, 3:05 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Statistical physicists find inspiration in systems where complex macroscopic behaviour arises from a simple set of underlying microscopic dynamical rules. Living systems obviously belong to this class, and statistical physics has a long history of applications to biological problems. Examples include determination of mutation rates by analysis of mutant number statistics [9, 10], the totally asymmetric exclusion process [11], which was originally proposed as a model for protein production from messenger RNA in biological cells [12], models for noise in gene regulation [13, 14], lattice models of growing populations [15, 16, 17], models for collective flocking and swarming behaviour [18, 19, 20] and non-equilibrium phase transitions in populations of self-propelled "swimmers" [21, 22, 23, 24, 25].
29/04/21, 3:06 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Yeah considering the fact we pay 10 bucks for Netflix even tho I rarely watch it, this seems justified

01/05/21, 7:41 pm - Astitv: isn't this the same source from the paper on distill?
01/05/21, 7:41 pm - Bodybuilder: 'yes
01/05/21, 7:43 pm - Astitv: in the nb they've integrated the js inside python itself na inside a script tag
01/05/21, 7:44 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: In the nb?
01/05/21, 7:44 pm - Bodybuilder: let me see toher implemtation of NFTs interactive
01/05/21, 7:44 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: WebGL?
01/05/21, 7:45 pm - Astitv: yep for the demo

01/05/21, 7:51 pm - Bodybuilder: save the svg and open in code
01/05/21, 7:51 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: They've used P5
01/05/21, 7:52 pm - Bodybuilder: yup we have to use tf.js
01/05/21, 7:52 pm - Astitv: https://www.generativehut.com/post/using-processing-for-music-visualization
01/05/21, 7:53 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: can use p5 too
01/05/21, 7:54 pm - Bodybuilder: wrapper?
01/05/21, 7:54 pm - Bodybuilder: Do we have an interactive implemetnation in p5 for NCA?
01/05/21, 7:55 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Not interactive, but we can make like the ones you sent earlier
01/05/21, 7:55 pm - Astitv: there's basic CA impls not anything generative
01/05/21, 7:56 pm - Astitv: our goal is to make interative NFTs right...
01/05/21, 7:56 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: how do you plan to put interactive ca impls as NFT?
01/05/21, 7:56 pm - Astitv: exactly my question
01/05/21, 7:57 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: there are two ways imo
01/05/21, 7:57 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: 1) Create a model, prettify it and sell it
01/05/21, 7:57 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: 2) Create an API integrate it with a website and sell the website
01/05/21, 7:58 pm - Astitv: are there other examples of interative nfts?
01/05/21, 7:58 pm - Bodybuilder: many
01/05/21, 7:58 pm - Bodybuilder: embed code in svg which runs js on the browser client side
01/05/21, 7:58 pm - Astitv: https://github.com/BeyondNFT/sandbox
01/05/21, 7:58 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: So basically this.
01/05/21, 7:59 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: like the distill's CA one right?
01/05/21, 7:59 pm - Astitv: so basically implement everything in js and sell it using the hosted service
01/05/21, 8:00 pm - Bodybuilder: https://github.com/neelts/svg-app
01/05/21, 8:00 pm - Bodybuilder: entire process https://tarwin.medium.com/hit-et-nunc-advanced-svg-nfts-a6040262f4d5
01/05/21, 8:00 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: How's this going for you @919082216009
01/05/21, 8:01 pm - Bodybuilder: still training
01/05/21, 8:04 pm - Astitv: so what we can do is generate the svg from the model output, embed js in it and turn the svg itself into an nft without the hassle of hosting it
01/05/21, 8:05 pm - Bodybuilder: No embed the tf.js in svg
01/05/21, 8:05 pm - Bodybuilder: Its client side hosted.
01/05/21, 8:06 pm - Astitv: ok so the model itself will be part of the svg
01/05/21, 8:09 pm - Bodybuilder changed the subject from "Neural Cellular Automata" to "NCA NFT"
01/05/21, 8:10 pm - Bodybuilder: yeah we can import weights from gh
01/05/21, 8:11 pm - Bodybuilder: @917903238656 can you try to embed a simple tf.jks using into svg
01/05/21, 8:12 pm - Astitv: is the growing ca model available on tfhub?
01/05/21, 8:12 pm - Astitv: I'm looking into that rn
01/05/21, 8:13 pm - Bodybuilder: I'm running using pretrained wights.
01/05/21, 8:13 pm - Bodybuilder: Gimme a sec
01/05/21, 8:16 pm - Astitv: @919082216009 wanna use magenta js?

01/05/21, 10:57 pm - Bodybuilder: groeing lungs
01/05/21, 11:23 pm - Bodybuilder: Done
01/05/21, 11:24 pm - Bodybuilder: Also fugured out checkpoint selection on our trained model
01/05/21, 11:27 pm - Bodybuilder: https://varun.ca/noise/
01/05/21, 11:31 pm - Astitv: how we gonna export it?
01/05/21, 11:31 pm - Astitv: the interation working?
01/05/21, 11:32 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes baby
01/05/21, 11:32 pm - Bodybuilder: embed the js code in the webGL demo
01/05/21, 11:32 pm - Bodybuilder: Can you test it on thew original code?
01/05/21, 11:33 pm - Bodybuilder: embed in svg
01/05/21, 11:33 pm - Astitv: can't we just copy the original code?
01/05/21, 11:33 pm - Bodybuilder: yeah
01/05/21, 11:33 pm - Bodybuilder: just change the model and data
01/05/21, 11:33 pm - Bodybuilder: checkpoint
01/05/21, 11:35 pm - Astitv: in the wegl demo section they've basically added the necessary js in an Ipython.html instance itself we can just copy paste it and use our model instead of that
01/05/21, 11:35 pm - Bodybuilder: export this part
01/05/21, 11:35 pm - Bodybuilder: TensorFlow.js Demo
01/05/21, 11:35 pm - Astitv: yes I'm talking about that one
01/05/21, 11:36 pm - Bodybuilder: dont worry about anything else just embde the original code and test it then we'll talk?
01/05/21, 11:36 pm - Bodybuilder: lungs on fore
01/05/21, 11:36 pm - Bodybuilder: fire
01/05/21, 11:37 pm - Bodybuilder: wanna see?
01/05/21, 11:37 pm - Astitv: you have the trained model so just use it in the script tag replace the GRAPH_URL with our model
01/05/21, 11:37 pm - Astitv: model's json should work
01/05/21, 11:37 pm - Astitv: YESSSSSSSSS

01/05/21, 11:39 pm - Bodybuilder: its fucking cool thats all lol
01/05/21, 11:39 pm - Astitv: we are regenerating high res images to use as nfts
01/05/21, 11:39 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: lmao I'm suree

02/05/21, 12:04 am - Bodybuilder: Tasks:
1. Embed tf.js code of original notebook to svg and render in drowned
2. Train model on high res image 
3. Mint NFT 
4. Make $$$
02/05/21, 12:05 am - Astitv: The tf.js part is sorted, the actual display part is the problem
02/05/21, 12:06 am - Bodybuilder: Figure it out!
02/05/21, 12:07 am - Bodybuilder: Btw this is unprecedented in the NFT world interactive NCA NFT.
02/05/21, 12:07 am - Astitv: no ü§≠
02/05/21, 12:07 am - Astitv: we don't do precendented shit
02/05/21, 12:07 am - Bodybuilder: Be the pioneer.
02/05/21, 12:07 am - Bodybuilder: Fuck yes
02/05/21, 12:08 am - Bodybuilder: And I‚Äôll push all content and notebooks to GH in some time
02/05/21, 12:09 am - Astitv: let's make a directory structure for storing the model checkpoints for different images
02/05/21, 12:10 am - Bodybuilder: Yes once we train on high res images
02/05/21, 12:10 am - Bodybuilder: Anything else that‚Äôd be cool to train on?
02/05/21, 12:11 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Majnu bhai‚Äôs painting
02/05/21, 12:12 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Geometrical artwork, defined structures using geo.
02/05/21, 12:12 am - Astitv: https://github.com/distillpub/post--growing-ca/blob/master/public/demo.js
02/05/21, 12:12 am - Astitv: @919024235097 check this out
02/05/21, 12:12 am - Astitv: The article at distill uses this to add the model rep
02/05/21, 12:12 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Ek sec
02/05/21, 12:19 am - Bodybuilder: Nice
02/05/21, 12:20 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Looks like there are some missing files or we have to change the dir inside the codebase
02/05/21, 12:22 am - Astitv: Figured it out!!!!
02/05/21, 12:24 am - Bodybuilder: Seriously?!
02/05/21, 12:26 am - Astitv: we can just use the IPython.display.SVG instead of HTML to render and then save the svg. The only problem is we'll have to explicitly write the svg part which none of us knows how to obviously
02/05/21, 12:27 am - Bodybuilder: Demo or didn‚Äôt happen
02/05/21, 12:28 am - Astitv: wut
02/05/21, 12:29 am - Bodybuilder: send an svg showing the functionality?
02/05/21, 12:29 am - Astitv: Wait I'm trying to get the existing code to work as svg
02/05/21, 12:30 am - Bodybuilder: cool cool m here
02/05/21, 12:33 am - Astitv: the last_checkpoint_fn is giving error for me so can't test the code
02/05/21, 12:38 am - Astitv: I'm going to sleep now
02/05/21, 12:41 am - Bodybuilder: gn
02/05/21, 12:43 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: I've got the same collab notebook runnin on my server
02/05/21, 12:43 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: <Media omitted>
02/05/21, 12:43 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Now have to check the html code to see where the changes have to be made
02/05/21, 12:48 am - Astitv: @919024235097 you having this same error?
02/05/21, 12:49 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Didn't check on our model yet
02/05/21, 12:49 am - Astitv: @919082216009 change the group dp to that lung we made
02/05/21, 12:49 am - Astitv: Okk
02/05/21, 12:49 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Oh yes please
02/05/21, 12:50 am - Astitv: I had a solution to making svg using the same code as in the model but couldn't test it due to that error. Will try tomorrow if i get the time
02/05/21, 12:50 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: so basically we have to change the ca.js file in the model, to our model and we're done!
02/05/21, 12:50 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: But first, we need to analyze the ca.js model
02/05/21, 12:51 am - Astitv: Try this if this works then great else I'll try my approach
02/05/21, 12:51 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: the html file is pointing to the demo.js file which is doing nothing but creating a frame for the execution of nca and the ca.js file is the main file where nca is built/exported or whatever
02/05/21, 12:51 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Haan sure
02/05/21, 12:52 am - Bodybuilder: Lol ye s
02/05/21, 12:53 am - Bodybuilder: Good progress I hear
02/05/21, 12:53 am - Bodybuilder: Buying XTZ to mint
02/05/21, 12:54 am - Astitv: ü§ëü§ëü§ë
02/05/21, 1:01 am - Bodybuilder: Alll set!!!
02/05/21, 1:01 am - Bodybuilder: Is tomorrow gonna be the day?!
02/05/21, 1:02 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Hopefullyyy
02/05/21, 1:02 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: <Media omitted>
02/05/21, 1:03 am - Bodybuilder: Yeah can start early tomorrow guys?
02/05/21, 1:03 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: @917903238656 can you analyse this?
02/05/21, 1:03 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: depends on how soon I sleep
02/05/21, 1:03 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: We can for sure
02/05/21, 1:04 am - Astitv: I did didn't find anything to go on
02/05/21, 1:04 am - Bodybuilder: True, solution don't
02/05/21, 1:04 am - Astitv: I got a deadline tomorrow
02/05/21, 1:04 am - Bodybuilder: Yeah I have some other idesa as well to integrate onto this NFT
02/05/21, 1:04 am - Astitv: Need to get that done then will get to this
02/05/21, 1:05 am - Astitv: How about at night tomorrow?
02/05/21, 1:05 am - Bodybuilder: do it now then tomorrow NFT genesis baby
02/05/21, 1:05 am - Bodybuilder: F
02/05/21, 1:05 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: <Media omitted>
02/05/21, 1:05 am - Astitv: Lmoa i would but the notebook isn't working
02/05/21, 1:05 am - Bodybuilder: why?
02/05/21, 1:06 am - Astitv: This
02/05/21, 1:06 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Love that for me
02/05/21, 1:06 am - Bodybuilder: replace w/ original codeblock if there's a typo
02/05/21, 1:06 am - Astitv: The ORIGINAL one is giving error lmao üòÇ
02/05/21, 1:07 am - Bodybuilder: lol
02/05/21, 1:07 am - Bodybuilder: I'll have a look lets move to GH as well, to solve these issues.
02/05/21, 1:07 am - Astitv: Once that works out i can test my solution if that works we're in business
02/05/21, 1:08 am - Bodybuilder: Cool let us know
02/05/21, 1:10 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: <Media omitted>
02/05/21, 1:10 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: what are these json files?
02/05/21, 1:11 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: can we have a .json file of sort of our lungs one
02/05/21, 1:11 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: ?
02/05/21, 1:11 am - Astitv: We have that.
02/05/21, 1:11 am - Astitv: For the model checkpoint
02/05/21, 1:14 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: check this file, is the syntax same?
02/05/21, 1:14 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: if yes, then we may have done it!
02/05/21, 1:16 am - Astitv: Can't. On phone
02/05/21, 1:16 am - Astitv: @919082216009 maybe can do that and see
02/05/21, 1:17 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: oh okay
02/05/21, 1:17 am - Bodybuilder: What syntax I'm out of webdev.
02/05/21, 1:17 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: not related to web dev
02/05/21, 1:18 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: related to model
02/05/21, 1:18 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: can we have something of this sorts for our lung waala midek
02/05/21, 1:18 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: *model
02/05/21, 1:18 am - Bodybuilder: looks ok to me
02/05/21, 1:19 am - Bodybuilder: I have the json for the lung
02/05/21, 1:19 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: bhejo
02/05/21, 1:21 am - Bodybuilder: I restarted my runtime, can you test this .json to svg
02/05/21, 1:21 am - Bodybuilder: we can have the weights for trained np there
02/05/21, 1:22 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: all the pre-given json are working fine, I have created a web server which has the SVG running
02/05/21, 1:22 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: like the one in the distill
02/05/21, 1:23 am - Bodybuilder: Cant we run it on-browser since it tf.js?
02/05/21, 1:23 am - Bodybuilder: v
02/05/21, 1:23 am - Bodybuilder: https://tarwin.medium.com/hit-et-nunc-advanced-svg-nfts-a6040262f4d5
02/05/21, 1:24 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: I am running it on the browser rn
02/05/21, 1:24 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: But not directly
02/05/21, 1:24 am - Bodybuilder: We can't keep a server running.
02/05/21, 1:24 am - Bodybuilder: has to run client side js
02/05/21, 1:26 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: have to revamp them'
02/05/21, 1:26 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: *then
02/05/21, 1:28 am - Bodybuilder: meaning?
02/05/21, 1:29 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: meaning the way I did this was only server side execution, now since we have to make it client side, I have to find another way to do it
02/05/21, 1:29 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Now will do tomorrow
02/05/21, 1:30 am - Bodybuilder: cool cool
02/05/21, 1:30 am - Bodybuilder: once we have a template can use ot for any other interactive NFTs
02/05/21, 1:31 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Yep
02/05/21, 1:32 am - Bodybuilder: Cool I'll work on the collab --> js pipeline also other experimental NFTs I was working on :)
02/05/21, 1:32 am - Bodybuilder: gn
02/05/21, 1:32 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Gn!
02/05/21, 10:19 am - Bodybuilder: gn when does everyone wake up lol
02/05/21, 10:09 pm - Bodybuilder: Any updates on injecting the js code in the svg?
02/05/21, 10:44 pm - Astitv: Ek baar demo wale cells ko run krke dekh mera error nhi resolve ho rha aur mai sare cells nhi krne wala lol
02/05/21, 10:46 pm - Astitv: Run ho jaye tfjs aur WebGL wale to send kriyo notebook phir mai svg export krne ka try karunga
03/05/21, 5:06 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Woke up finally!
03/05/21, 5:06 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: You won't believe, I legit slept the whole day yesterday
03/05/21, 5:06 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Like woke up just to eat
03/05/21, 5:11 am - Bodybuilder: Same
03/05/21, 5:11 am - Bodybuilder: Lol
03/05/21, 5:11 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: getting on it now
03/05/21, 5:16 am - Bodybuilder: Cool cool I‚Äôll get some coffee in me and get to it as well
03/05/21, 6:59 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: https://rarible.com/
03/05/21, 6:59 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: We should use IPFS for NFT file storage
03/05/21, 7:00 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: [6:48 AM, 5/3/2021] Pratham: I'm aware of this technology but what is stopping someone from taking all the art on ArtStation, uploading it, and claiming it as their own? Oracle problem is not solved...
[6:48 AM, 5/3/2021] Pratham: As far as I'm aware, nothing currently stops others from stealing, minting and listing your work. This is a problem. Not only on the seller's but also on the buyer's side. In case you want to buy something, do your research first. When an artwork gets stolen, the platform should be able to block the wallet from which the NFT is listed. This way it's no longer available.
[6:49 AM, 5/3/2021] Pratham: Basically no way to authenticate and trademark on a NFT
03/05/21, 7:04 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Also, I hope you guys are aware that selling each NFT costs a gas fee of around $15-80 dollars
03/05/21, 7:09 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: A heads up for creators, there's lots of hidden costs in this - Creating one piece ended up costing me around $90 due to Ethereum transaction fees and the platform failing five times (I had to pay Ethereum fees for each of these too)
$20 for Dollar to Ethereum
$70 to create the artwork.
_Found this somewhere_
03/05/21, 7:15 am - Bodybuilder: We are
03/05/21, 7:16 am - Bodybuilder: Let‚Äôs focus on getting it working...Also check out HicEtNunc IPFS Storage limit is 50MB
03/05/21, 7:19 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: https://pinata.cloud/ 1gb storage limit
03/05/21, 7:27 am - Bodybuilder: Let‚Äôs work on getting this thing work first
03/05/21, 9:56 am - Astitv: Damn
04/05/21, 7:16 am - Bodybuilder: can we embed this js and run it within a SVG container?>
04/05/21, 7:16 am - Bodybuilder: https://doug2k1.github.io/javascript-camera/
04/05/21, 7:45 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Any updates on this?
04/05/21, 7:45 am - Bodybuilder: \collab is runnign for me
04/05/21, 7:47 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Okay!
04/05/21, 7:48 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Doesn‚Äôt it sound strange that we want a dynamic tfjs/webgl model to run completely on client side?
04/05/21, 7:48 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: All the time I‚Äôve seen or heard that any dynamic thing runs on the server side only
04/05/21, 7:49 am - Bodybuilder: Model training is not running on the client side only inference.
04/05/21, 7:49 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Not about model training
04/05/21, 7:49 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: About exporting the js as svg and making it run on the client side
04/05/21, 7:49 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Dynamically
04/05/21, 7:50 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Making it static is deadass easy we could put a gifüòÇ but dynamic on the client side is‚Ä¶.
04/05/21, 7:50 am - Bodybuilder: People are embedding audio reactive ML models in SVG man.
04/05/21, 7:51 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: That we can directly run?
04/05/21, 7:51 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: can you send that cloudfare ipfs svg once again?
04/05/21, 7:52 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Also @919082216009 check your dm
04/05/21, 7:52 am - Bodybuilder: yes
04/05/21, 7:52 am - Bodybuilder: which
04/05/21, 7:52 am - Bodybuilder: Oh sorry forgot.
04/05/21, 7:53 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Wait I‚Äôll find in them in the chats
04/05/21, 7:53 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: Koi naa
04/05/21, 7:54 am - Bodybuilder: Can you guys embed it today?
04/05/21, 9:35 am - Astitv: I tried using the existing code for embedding, didn't work. Will look into making a separate svg with the model exported
04/05/21, 9:50 am - Bodybuilder: Cool pleasedo.
04/05/21, 9:50 am - Bodybuilder: I'll run the model again and remove the unnecessary code and save the weights/checkpoints
04/05/21, 1:58 pm - Astitv: Sweet
05/05/21, 3:47 am - Bodybuilder: Can you start by embedding the original notebook example?
05/05/21, 11:37 am - Astitv: Tried everything I could think of short of rewriting the js part completely. Nothing worked. The only thing that has worked so far is hosting the html with a few changes. Maybe we could import the model into the same code as the article and use that. But that would be plagiarism/pirating so idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
05/05/21, 11:39 am - Bodybuilder: Once we get that working all we have to do is replace the weights..
05/05/21, 11:40 am - Astitv: We can export the webgl_models8 json for our own emojis and use that in the demo.js file but that would still require hosting it that's the main issue
05/05/21, 11:42 am - Bodybuilder: Distill is hosted on GH so no compute is being used right?
05/05/21, 11:42 am - Astitv: It still is hosted man I tried running it static the canvas wouldn't render, but it rendered when i hosted it
05/05/21, 11:43 am - Bodybuilder: Interesting.
05/05/21, 11:44 am - Astitv: Indeed.
05/05/21, 11:44 am - Astitv: What's the plan with research?
05/05/21, 11:45 am - Bodybuilder: No reason a tfjs model shoul d require hosting
05/05/21, 11:45 am - Bodybuilder: Weekend.
05/05/21, 11:45 am - Astitv: I thought so too but the evidence suggests otherwise
05/05/21, 11:45 am - Astitv: Cool
05/05/21, 11:45 am - Bodybuilder: Evidence can be deceptive lol
05/05/21, 11:46 am - Bodybuilder: Should we bring in another webdev to test out?

05/05/21, 11:47 am - Bodybuilder: Kartik?
05/05/21, 11:48 am - Astitv: Could ask him if the model can be run without hosting it, and how..
05/05/21, 11:48 am - Bodybuilder: yeah
05/05/21, 11:48 am - Bodybuilder: Gonna add him to the group?
05/05/21, 11:50 am - Astitv: Your call I'm out of ideas

05/05/21, 11:54 am - Bodybuilder: I've read advanced-svg as well lol
05/05/21, 11:55 am - Astitv: I've read the entire doc on svg at w3 just to find a way to import the existing js code from Colab into raw svg
05/05/21, 11:56 am - Bodybuilder: we have other formats as well svg-xml
05/05/21, 11:58 am - Astitv: Ik I have tried html itself too but hosting is the issue
05/05/21, 12:49 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: This exact same thing I told you guys 2 days ago
05/05/21, 12:50 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: We can manipulate the distill model with our weights and json to make it run
05/05/21, 12:50 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Moreover if it directly runs from github then this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue
05/05/21, 1:04 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Yep, we can ask him

08/05/21, 11:54 am - Astitv: @919082216009 this is what I was talking about when I said let's work on analysing how the macroscopic behavior of chaotic systems depends on the microscopic behavior
08/05/21, 11:54 am - Bodybuilder: Fucking hell man
08/05/21, 11:54 am - Astitv: the inverse problem - going from desired behaviour to system design - is at the heart of many barriers for the advance of biomedicine, robotics, and other fields of importance to society.
08/05/21, 11:54 am - Astitv: fucking hell indeed
08/05/21, 11:54 am - Bodybuilder: This is diff
08/05/21, 11:54 am - Bodybuilder: Wanna run demos lol
08/05/21, 11:54 am - Bodybuilder: Inject viruses
08/05/21, 11:55 am - Astitv: ik I'm talking about their general idea behind the work they're building on
08/05/21, 11:56 am - Astitv: In this work, we train adversaries whose goal is to reprogram CA into doing something other than what they were trained to do. In order to understand what kinds of lower-level signals alter system-level behavior of our CA, it is important to understand how these CA are constructed and where local versus global information resides.
08/05/21, 11:56 am - Bodybuilder: Yeha see
08/05/21, 11:56 am - Astitv: this

08/05/21, 11:56 am - Astitv: got it
08/05/21, 11:58 am - Pratham CSE MUJ: This is the low level implication of how microscopic changes adversely affects macroscopic change or vice versa, there is lot more to it
08/05/21, 11:59 am - Astitv: there's so so much more!
08/05/21, 12:00 pm - Bodybuilder: Yo

08/05/21, 12:38 pm - Bodybuilder: problem?
08/05/21, 12:39 pm - Astitv: no problem they just have some limit on features but I wouldn't worry about that
08/05/21, 12:40 pm - Astitv: the animations occupy the entire window so that's cool
08/05/21, 12:40 pm - Astitv: @919082216009 is html also one of the data types that you had in that excel sheet
08/05/21, 12:41 pm - Astitv: formats*
08/05/21, 12:47 pm - Bodybuilder: Think so
08/05/21, 12:47 pm - Bodybuilder: ALos can't we directly host it on ipfs
08/05/21, 12:48 pm - Bodybuilder: rather than wrapping it in svg then hosting that.
08/05/21, 12:48 pm - Astitv: we definetely can
08/05/21, 12:49 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: we can try, but it has to be a single file if we want to host on ipfs right?
08/05/21, 12:49 pm - Bodybuilder: yeah I think so
08/05/21, 12:49 pm - Astitv: really?
08/05/21, 12:49 pm - Bodybuilder: also  just insert the websiter astitv hosted in an IFRAME

08/05/21, 12:49 pm - Bodybuilder: and put it in the svg

08/05/21, 12:51 pm - Astitv: we can host multipage sites on ipfs
08/05/21, 12:52 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: gg
08/05/21, 12:52 pm - Astitv: why do svg if we can simply do the HTML itself? svg won't render the animation afaik
08/05/21, 12:52 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: yeah let's do the HTML directly
08/05/21, 12:52 pm - Astitv: for some reason the running the index.html without hosting doesn't render the texture at all
08/05/21, 12:53 pm - Bodybuilder: can YOU FIND THE XLS SHEET?
08/05/21, 12:53 pm - Astitv: wut?
08/05/21, 12:53 pm - Bodybuilder: witht the supported formatss

08/05/21, 12:54 pm - Astitv: I don't have that
08/05/21, 12:55 pm - Astitv: We were looking at it last that day on vc
08/05/21, 12:55 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: Yes, this is because without the server the js doesn't gets executed, in programs where js has its own execution and not just used in manipulating the html, it needs to be hosted first
08/05/21, 12:56 pm - Astitv: Yess
08/05/21, 12:57 pm - Astitv: @919082216009 what's the process for generating nft?

08/05/21, 1:00 pm - Astitv: Which tool is this?
08/05/21, 1:00 pm - Bodybuilder: https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/wiki/Interactive-OBJKTs
08/05/21, 1:01 pm - Astitv: ‚úåüèª
08/05/21, 1:02 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: You planning to host on hicetnunc?
08/05/21, 1:02 pm - Pratham CSE MUJ: What about rarible?
08/05/21, 1:03 pm - Bodybuilder: https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/develop/templates/html-template
08/05/21, 1:05 pm - Bodybuilder: <Media omitted>
08/05/21, 1:06 pm - Astitv: Isn't that because we need to host it first
08/05/21, 1:06 pm - Astitv: In and of itself it won't render anything
08/05/21, 1:08 pm - Bodybuilder: api calls are blovked to expternal webistes
08/05/21, 1:08 pm - Bodybuilder: So have rto embed the data read the guide
08/05/21, 1:14 pm - Astitv: ok
08/05/21, 1:15 pm - Astitv: wait so it it is blocked, does that mean hosted sites cannot be used? because without that, the HTML zip itself wouldn't render anything..
08/05/21, 1:16 pm - Astitv: if
08/05/21, 1:17 pm - Bodybuilder: Thats why I mentioned iframe
08/05/21, 1:17 pm - Bodybuilder: embed the sutge website in an iframe and gimme the index.html w/ that

08/05/21, 1:18 pm - Astitv: wait
08/05/21, 1:18 pm - Bodybuilder: kk

08/05/21, 1:59 pm - Bodybuilder: https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/main/templates/html-template
08/05/21, 1:59 pm - Bodybuilder: oor fuck it put that iframe in the svg na ...
08/05/21, 2:00 pm - Astitv: dude this is the issue
08/05/21, 2:00 pm - Astitv: At the moment calls to external sites are being blocked, even if they seem to work locally when you are testing. So any dependency needs to be included locally in the zip
08/05/21, 2:01 pm - Bodybuilder: yeah
08/05/21, 2:01 pm - Astitv: iframe is not good since it will be blocked anyway
08/05/21, 2:01 pm - Bodybuilder: but then hwo do interactive svgs work then
08/05/21, 2:01 pm - Bodybuilder: ok embedded js code nm
08/05/21, 2:01 pm - Astitv: they include the script with them

08/05/21, 2:04 pm - Astitv: using any of what we've been trying ain't gonna work because it'll need hosting regardless
08/05/21, 2:04 pm - Bodybuilder: nope export mp4
08/05/21, 2:04 pm - Bodybuilder: ANIMATION

12/05/21, 10:17 am - Astitv: beats me
12/05/21, 10:17 am - Astitv: <Media omitted>
12/05/21, 10:23 am - Bodybuilder: Ask around to other webdevs if you know any?
12/05/21, 10:27 am - Astitv: they've got all the muscle in one js and they've embedded it in the canvas, of absolute dims so not so mysterious
12/05/21, 10:28 am - Bodybuilder: where's the js running?
12/05/21, 10:30 am - Astitv: they've hosted it on ipfs so definitely not statically
12/05/21, 10:31 am - Astitv: and ipfs allows for multipage sites to be hosted so that's not an issue
12/05/21, 10:43 am - Astitv: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmWMZAQ2thNsPskV6tr7KzVYMb4qJ4oFURNEzhdUJezKNq/main.js?a475656b049a62321ab1
12/05/21, 10:48 am - Bodybuilder: Is this the embedded code?
12/05/21, 10:53 am - Astitv: this is the js behind the anim
12/05/21, 10:53 am - Bodybuilder: SO just the renderer?
12/05/21, 10:53 am - Astitv: wym?
12/05/21, 10:54 am - Bodybuilder: just rendering it onto the canvas..
12/05/21, 10:55 am - Astitv: not just rendering, afaik it's the entirety of the animation in one file
12/05/21, 10:55 am - Astitv: but the code itself is too bloated to analyse so can't delve into it
12/05/21, 10:56 am - Bodybuilder: No its only taking i/o and other condioitons for the interaction afai can see.
12/05/21, 10:58 am - Astitv: well there's no other links or scripts in the source so idk
12/05/21, 11:01 am - Bodybuilder: k
12/05/21, 11:05 am - Bodybuilder: https attack works on ipfs?

28/05/21, 3:56 pm - Astitv: will look into other ideas as well before jumping into one thing
28/05/21, 3:57 pm - Bodybuilder: Y
28/05/21, 3:57 pm - Astitv: sure I will. could you too

10/07/21, 8:57 pm - Bodybuilder: Here
10/07/21, 8:58 pm - Astitv: What did you come across?
10/07/21, 9:04 pm - Bodybuilder: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15240
10/07/21, 9:09 pm - Astitv: oooo...this is very interesting, and right up our alley feels like
10/07/21, 9:10 pm - Astitv: It is an end-to-end differentiable system where the parameters of the neural
network can be optimized to achieve a particular task.
10/07/21, 9:10 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes
10/07/21, 9:10 pm - Astitv: exactly my inspiration
10/07/21, 9:10 pm - Bodybuilder: Basically application of NCA to do basic DL tasks
10/07/21, 9:11 pm - Bodybuilder: There‚Äôs also another work on building functional machines
10/07/21, 9:11 pm - Bodybuilder: By Sebastian Risi
10/07/21, 9:11 pm - Astitv: it's the same thing just the reward function is approximated using the nca as a substitute for traditional nets
10/07/21, 9:13 pm - Astitv: I wonder if it's possible to simulate simplified versions of environments as CA's and use them to train agents to do certain tasks within the environment represented by these CAs
10/07/21, 9:14 pm - Astitv: so the CA has both an agent component to it as well as an environment component and they operate on the same system even though their evolutionary traits are distinct as well as inter dependent
10/07/21, 9:14 pm - Astitv: will look into it
10/07/21, 9:15 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes see world models papers
10/07/21, 9:16 pm - Astitv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08737
10/07/21, 9:16 pm - Astitv: this?
10/07/21, 9:17 pm - Astitv: let's look into CA for RL more and proceed on that?
10/07/21, 9:17 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes
10/07/21, 9:17 pm - Bodybuilder: Also NCA for PCG
10/07/21, 9:18 pm - Astitv: sure...can also to some combined work on creativity and CA
10/07/21, 9:19 pm - Astitv: any recent papers on this?
10/07/21, 9:21 pm - Bodybuilder: https://worldmodels.github.io
10/07/21, 9:21 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes and game design!
10/07/21, 9:22 pm - Astitv: the applications of evolving environments is endless
10/07/21, 9:23 pm - Astitv: irl every environment is effected by the agents in it and the correlations between the two is too interesting to not explore
10/07/21, 9:24 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes!
10/07/21, 9:24 pm - Astitv: this is dope
10/07/21, 9:25 pm - Astitv: use ca instead of gans and develop two-faced behavior for both agent and the world model and we have got something
10/07/21, 9:26 pm - Astitv: but how is this different from generic model based learning
10/07/21, 9:26 pm - Bodybuilder: Didn‚Äôt get that?
10/07/21, 9:28 pm - Astitv: basically develop learning abilities for both the agent and the environment so neither is static throughout the episodes, unlike building approximate models of the environment which the agent can use to evolve because when the state of the environment can change depending on the behaviour of the agent, dynamic approximate models are too expensive to maintain
10/07/21, 9:32 pm - Bodybuilder: Any literature?
10/07/21, 9:33 pm - Astitv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09721
10/07/21, 9:34 pm - Astitv: somewhat related but not quite as the approach is different. uses proxies for approximating while the environment stays static
10/07/21, 9:51 pm - Bodybuilder: Learning in latent space right?
10/07/21, 9:51 pm - Bodybuilder: That‚Äôs what world models does..
10/07/21, 10:16 pm - Astitv: kinda similar but the difference is in the multiple "synthetic environments" in this case ig although I'll have to read up on the world models to get a better idea
10/07/21, 11:13 pm - Bodybuilder: I love the idea of learning in latent space really cool.
10/07/21, 11:39 pm - Astitv: I fail to see it being different from model based learning tho
10/07/21, 11:40 pm - Bodybuilder: It reconstructs the model instead of directly using it is what I understood, however I have to study more.
10/07/21, 11:41 pm - Astitv: It seems to me like it's just one "way" of doing model based learning, using nns tho idk how that's any different from past work on deep rl
10/07/21, 11:42 pm - Bodybuilder: Lets start w/ something simple, you free now for a quick chat?
10/07/21, 11:43 pm - Astitv: Have a headache rn gonna try and get some sleep, tomorrow?
10/07/21, 11:43 pm - Bodybuilder: Cool
10/07/21, 11:44 pm - Astitv: Let's have a vc tmmrrw and discuss possible ideas that are within our ballpark nothing too ootw
10/07/21, 11:44 pm - Astitv: And build on that
10/07/21, 11:44 pm - Bodybuilder: Yes early morning works?
10/07/21, 11:45 pm - Astitv: Anytime after 9 works for me.
10/07/21, 11:45 pm - Astitv: Wby
