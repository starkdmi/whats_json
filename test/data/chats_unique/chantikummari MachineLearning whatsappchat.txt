I completed it and the Skype interview was scheduled. But he didn't come to take the interview. When I messaged him on LinkedIn, I got blocked. Plus, the company that he keeps on talking about doesn't even have a proper website. How can they need interns in so many different domains when there is not a single employee of that company present on LinkedIn?

10/30/19, 1:40 PM - +91 98904 00436: @918237040802 can we have linear regression or logistic regression ML implemented in Random forest???
10/30/19, 1:42 PM - Satyajit: Three of them are different algos. You can use them separately and compare the results
10/30/19, 1:44 PM - Satyajit: Random Forest is basically an ensemble technique
10/30/19, 1:44 PM - Satyajit: Elaborate your use case
10/30/19, 1:45 PM - +91 98904 00436: Yes! I was just wondering if we could implement Regressions in random forests. But now I understand that using Random forest we can only implement multiple decision trees on the bootstrapped samples
10/30/19, 1:46 PM - Satyajit: Hello Everyone,

I am looking out to hire an experienced candidate as a CTO for my start up. He/she should have a very strong knowledge in technical (web/app development, AI, ML, IOT) domain.

10/30/19, 2:12 PM - +91 98904 00436: When we perform a multiple linear regression, we get p-values for all the coefficients.

But in the basics of statistics we have learnt to reject Ho if P-value is less than alpha.

I don‚Äôt remember mentioning a significance level in the regression. Also, there are stars nexts to P-values to indicate the significance of the independent variable.Then what is the significance of these p-values here?
10/30/19, 2:13 PM - +91 98904 00436: Hypothesis testing has always been a pissing of concept. I never got a clarity on this.
10/30/19, 2:18 PM - Satyajit: There's a blog on minitab, go through it, it helps you in the concepts of interpreting p-values

10/31/19, 12:11 AM - +91 96109 60231: How is Google analytics different from Tableau and power BI?
10/31/19, 12:14 AM - Satyajit: You mean Google data studio?
10/31/19, 12:14 AM - +91 96109 60231: Yes
10/31/19, 12:16 AM - Satyajit: On an Enterprise level, they provide almost similar features
10/31/19, 12:16 AM - Satyajit: On a developer level, PowerBi is really frustrating with very limited features as compared to GDS
10/31/19, 12:18 AM - Satyajit: And moreover, it's an open debate topic, you can try all of them and then decide yourself.
10/31/19, 12:20 AM - +91 96109 60231: Okay... I have basic knowledge of Tableau and was just encountered with Google data
10/31/19, 12:20 AM - +91 90170 97755: Satyajit, i would say data studio has less features than tableau and power bi
Data studio is free to use. I mostly use this for POCs and demo's.
Lot a essential features are not there in data studio.
10/31/19, 12:20 AM - +91 90170 97755: You can also try Looker which was recently acquired by Google
10/31/19, 12:21 AM - Satyajit: Oh okay then, I am using PowerBI Pro, and I am happy with it, however Tableau is expensive..
10/31/19, 12:21 AM - Satyajit: Not much aware of gds in depth though.
10/31/19, 12:22 AM - +91 90170 97755: Yes it is
If the reason is just the learning, we can use data studio
10/31/19, 12:22 AM - Satyajit: True
10/31/19, 12:25 AM - +91 90170 97755: Satyajeet, i have a request to make.
I am totally into Data Engg field.

It would be great if we can get some assignments on Data Science field for some exposure.

This would help us to improve our skill sets and can help you as well in various aspects.

Would like to know more from you on this.
10/31/19, 12:26 AM - Satyajit: We are already working on it Dhruv

10/31/19, 1:07 AM - +91 99809 35680: What does Power BI, tableau have that cant be done in python? Never used those software
10/31/19, 1:10 AM - +91 96109 60231: You don't have to write codes in Tableau
10/31/19, 1:10 AM - +91 99809 35680: Any special feature you personally feel is exclusive though?
10/31/19, 1:11 AM - +91 99809 35680: That is very difficult in python to do?
10/31/19, 1:11 AM - +91 99809 35680: I guess the presentable to the business folks for presentation the software is good right?
10/31/19, 1:12 AM - +91 99809 35680: I would have tried the software but its costly and already occupied with edx üòÖ
10/31/19, 1:12 AM - Kartik LinkedIn: As far as my knowledge u design metric sets in cubes , as in u take the various parameters put them in metric set in a cube 

And then you use some drag and drop feature along with advanced filter feature and some logic building which is done using small code 


Comparing to python ..these tools are much easier with way advanced features compared to python as they can help u design a dashboard , plus easy to develope
10/31/19, 1:13 AM - +91 99809 35680: Oh.. üëçüèº
10/31/19, 1:13 AM - +91 96109 60231: It is user friendly and interactive to use while in python you have to write whole code
10/31/19, 1:13 AM - +91 96109 60231: Also you can easily create dashboard in Tableau
10/31/19, 1:13 AM - +91 99809 35680: I see üëçüèº
10/31/19, 1:14 AM - +91 96109 60231: You can use basic version of Tableau for free
10/31/19, 1:14 AM - +91 99809 35680: But at the end of the day you dont find a feature from Tableau or Power BI that python cant do right?

10/31/19, 1:15 AM - +91 96109 60231: AndIf you are student then get Tableau desktop(advance version) for 6 months free

10/31/19, 1:18 AM - +91 96445 64455: Tablue is just a easiest form to do it in paid model. Try Python only
10/31/19, 1:43 AM - +965 9729 6922: Power bi is just a dashboard if I'm not wrong but by the way you can develop  web based dashboard tool very easily by using Google charts and chart.js

But it is good enough. While solving the equations concept of rate of convergence arises. Now a days there are many powerful tools available. So choice between Excel & other software is with user.

11/4/19, 10:19 PM - +91 90388 85247: Real time project means the data is tokenized or from open datasets or how is it

11/4/19, 10:24 PM - +91 90388 85247: Oh
11/4/19, 10:25 PM - Satyajit: Try to understand the difference. 

The use cases are real time business problems which are already productionized in various companies. We are trying to get as much use cases as possible from various experts, and provide you for practice.
11/4/19, 10:26 PM - Satyajit: So you get the data, you get the business problem, and the data, and we help you to build it on your own, so that you understand how the end to end product works.
11/4/19, 10:29 PM - +91 90388 85247: Ok but there would be a difference in distribution in terms of real world data and use case data

I have a dataframe in which I have multiple columns and the columns are having text data , categories,  and also there is a column having images.
So, how can i build a classifier model ? How can i deal with different types of columns ?
11/5/19, 11:34 AM - Satyajit: Column having images as in?
11/5/19, 11:34 AM - Satyajit: Categorical data can be converted to numerical using LabelEncoder or getdummies

11/5/19, 4:52 PM - +91 88002 94718: End goal is to predict the tags

11/5/19, 8:56 PM - +91 88002 94718: 57039 unique tags
11/5/19, 8:57 PM - Satyajit: Omg, and how many records per class?
11/5/19, 8:58 PM - +91 88002 94718: Records per class means ??

11/5/19, 8:59 PM - +91 88002 94718: The last column is the target column (tags)
11/5/19, 9:00 PM - Satyajit: 7 rows for each class i.e tags, it's difficult to build a classifier with such less records
11/5/19, 9:01 PM - +91 88002 94718: Sorry, i mean there are 7 variables
11/5/19, 9:01 PM - +91 88002 94718: I haven't checked the no. Of entries for each tag
11/5/19, 9:03 PM - Satyajit: Do that first, these are basics before asking questions
11/5/19, 9:03 PM - Satyajit: Try to do some R&D before asking questions

11/5/19, 9:06 PM - Satyajit: First give a try, do some r&d on classification models, how to deal with categorical data etc etc. And then if you face any issues, you are free to ask here.

11/7/19, 11:11 PM - +91 81086 65559: Yes dat depends completely on business problem..

Just wanted to know wat are the process which are usually carried out
11/7/19, 11:19 PM - Satyajit: Boss @918108665559, as said by Salman, it depends on what you are trying to do, need to see the data to comment upon, without looking at data, commenting is useless and valueless.
11/7/19, 11:20 PM - +91 96445 64455: Dude ur asking for a buisness idea actually
11/7/19, 11:21 PM - Satyajit: Exactly
11/7/19, 11:26 PM - +91 81086 65559: Okay i keep it simple..
Consider we have sentiment analysis problem..

So we look for some features like length , counts of punctuation, upper case count , polarity of text..
Some time we plot wordcloud to summy the context ..
Kind of this process...
11/7/19, 11:29 PM - +91 96445 64455: Yes
11/7/19, 11:29 PM - +91 96445 64455: Then
11/7/19, 11:30 PM - Satyajit: So you answered yourself for sentiment analysis problems, similarly other problems have other things to analyse, so it's a very broad question that you are asking, and it's difficult to answer for every use case, so be specific what's your requirement
11/7/19, 11:30 PM - +91 99809 35680: Ive never done sentiment analysis but a basic thought would be to have a list of negative and positive word, create a new predictor that counts for every negative or positive word found in your text
11/7/19, 11:31 PM - +91 99809 35680: I think theres something is NLP under sentiment analysis called ‚Äúneg‚Äù ‚Äúpos‚Äù values.. I need to look into it
11/7/19, 11:31 PM - +91 99809 35680: in* NLP
11/7/19, 11:31 PM - +91 96445 64455: I have a good experience in sentiment analysis but wont share a idea

11/12/19, 1:48 AM - +91 91089 70830: For predicting food delivery time which features could be important?
11/12/19, 1:49 AM - Professor Madhukar: What is the list of features
11/12/19, 1:51 AM - +91 91089 70830: Restaurant, location, Cuisines, Average-cost, Minimum-order, Rating, Votes, Reviews
11/12/19, 2:06 AM - +91 97413 33211: I believe location could be important.
11/12/19, 2:06 AM - +91 97413 33211: Distance from any restaurant generally decides it's delivery time. Intuitively.
11/12/19, 2:07 AM - +91 96445 64455: Distance between points according to traffic live details
11/12/19, 2:08 AM - +91 90388 85247: Distance, order quantity, location, queue of food items, weather
11/12/19, 2:09 AM - Professor Madhukar: Restaurant & location are two prime factors. But reviews could also be one of the important factor. Because it reflects opinions about service type. Which in turn will be associated with delivery time.
11/12/19, 2:09 AM - +91 91089 70830: I mentioned features for a reasonüòÖ
11/12/19, 2:10 AM - +91 90388 85247: I think you should add weather also
11/12/19, 2:11 AM - +91 91089 70830: Am not including myself...its already given to me
11/12/19, 2:12 AM - +91 90388 85247: Ok then you should ask üòõ because it is one of the important factor
11/12/19, 2:12 AM - +91 98403 37017: If you say location.. Do we have both the Restaurant's and Delivery location ?
11/12/19, 2:12 AM - +91 91089 70830: But reviews mostly reflects about the taste
11/12/19, 2:12 AM - +91 77957 08560 left
11/12/19, 2:13 AM - Professor Madhukar: Reviews reflect service type also...
11/12/19, 2:13 AM - +91 91089 70830: Only restaurant
11/12/19, 2:14 AM - +91 91089 70830: Yaa I agree
11/12/19, 2:14 AM - +91 97413 33211: Reviews can be of anything. Service, delivery, food quality, ambience etc. And not to forget reviews are the opinions of the people.
11/12/19, 2:14 AM - Professor Madhukar: Service is good
Service is prompt 
Service is poor
Delay in service
No service
This type reviews I read...
11/12/19, 2:18 AM - +91 98403 37017: Before we try to give more suggestions... I think it would be better if we know the answers for following question... Is it possible for you to get more data if you want or you're trying out to build something based on sample data from the web ?
11/12/19, 12:04 PM - +971 52 542 8194: There are couple of feature around the domain, which can impact the delivery. But do you have the flexibility to get more features data? If yes
1-All  the past delivery‚Äôs time.
2-Distance from origin to destination
3- current traffic. 
4- every item processing time 
Etc. 
if no,
You can drive new fretures from existing features.

11/12/19, 5:54 PM - +91 99809 35680: Satyajit, ARIMA and GARCH models are only useful for short term forecasts right? Which models or techniques are good for long term forecasting in your experience?
11/12/19, 5:56 PM - Satyajit: Try fbProphet, or LSTM

11/12/19, 6:04 PM - +91 96613 43922: How to optimize the prophet model
