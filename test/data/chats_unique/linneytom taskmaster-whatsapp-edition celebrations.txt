13/05/2022, 18:17 - Caroline: This message was deleted
13/05/2022, 18:46 - Caroline: Ok so plan?
13/05/2022, 21:19 - Ezmay: Yeah Carrie that actually bang out of order
13/05/2022, 21:20 - Ezmay: Tut tut
18/05/2022, 09:07 - Caroline: Hey guys
18/05/2022, 09:07 - Caroline: <Media omitted>
18/05/2022, 09:07 - Caroline: This is our bill situation
18/05/2022, 09:08 - Caroline: Should we split an even 3
18/05/2022, 09:22 - Ezmay: Hai hai haiiiii
18/05/2022, 09:22 - Ezmay: Is it the 892 figure you’re referring to?
18/05/2022, 09:23 - Ezmay: I’m sorry guys that’s a little way out my budget 😅😅
18/05/2022, 09:23 - Caroline: dw dw I know 550 is your max
18/05/2022, 09:24 - Caroline: it still would make it cheaper for Tom and I currently
18/05/2022, 09:24 - Caroline: i am just giving an overview of what equal split would look
18/05/2022, 09:25 - Ezmay: Gooootvha gotcha xxxx
18/05/2022, 09:28 - Caroline: Id be spending 2/3 of my income on rent and utilities, so I'm not sure how long this is economically logical for
18/05/2022, 09:32 - Caroline: but I'd rather we like where we live and don't end up living somewhere that is in a dodgy area / dodgy commute home and just as if not worse chaotic flat, at least this way we get a homely shared space and big rooms ... lots to consider
18/05/2022, 09:33 - Caroline: could we have another meet up and discuss in person? I think IMO its completely fair if we stagger pricing cos we each have different incomes but maybe we could be open about how much of our income is going towards rent and work out what is fair that way?
18/05/2022, 09:34 - Caroline: but i don't know how to discuss money because I'm ✨British✨ and 💅awkward💅
18/05/2022, 09:51 - Ezmay: Alllll makes sense
18/05/2022, 09:51 - Ezmay: Let’s have another chatty chat
