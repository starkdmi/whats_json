25/06/15 15:30:22: Giorgia's Phone: Muffin, I wanted to say to you that you shouldn't feel bad about big T. You brought him to the vet. If they couldn't understand what the problem was, that was absolutely not your fault. Plus, Big T doesn't care at all about his tail, but only about the food and the love of his dad.
I'm sorry also that I shared with you the fact that I wanted to know it. You should always say to me only what you want, without feeling obliged about anything. I understand that being so far implies some aspects like this one, it's naturally simpler to decide what to share. 
No worries at all:) 
Have a wonderful wake up!

04/10/15 18:19:29: Giorgia's Phone: Sweet heart...so I was researching for more information about the mountains in Switzerland...
04/10/15 18:26:16: Giorgia's Phone: I think they are already snowed. 
If we go to Berne by flight maybe we can be able to see the mountains. There is a train (one hour far away by driving from Berne - still figuring out if there is a bus or something) that we should take to go to the Jungfrau area (where Eiger and other beautiful montains are located). 
It should be very efficient but very pricy as well. Only  that train costs a little more of 120 euros per person.
Switzerland is one of the most organized countries in Europe, but the cost of living is very high. 
Imagine that a peer of mine in EY gains about 4 times more than me.
04/10/15 18:27:08: Giorgia's Phone: Let me know :)
04/10/15 18:27:56: Giorgia's Phone: And goodmorning ;)

06/01/16 16:40:54: Kevin Dyer: It's actually cold and rainy here :( how's your day going? I applied to the second place but I have a bad feeling I won't get it because of my credit. I might need to ask my mom to co sign with me.
06/01/16 16:48:13: Giorgia's Phone: Oh no! I wonder why!
06/01/16 16:50:26: Giorgia's Phone: I can't imagine why! Yes muff, ask your mom. It's just for facade. You are never going to ask her for money

07/01/16 06:05:01: Kevin Dyer: Hey morning lover!
07/01/16 06:45:07: Kevin Dyer: I had some major luck with the apartment I saw today but the lady didn't like that you will eventually. She doesn't want to rent to more than one person. But she told me about a bigger studio apartment she is showing Saturday and Sunday. Hopefully it works out! How did you sleep baby?
07/01/16 06:56:03: Kevin Dyer: You're a very special little muffin
07/01/16 06:56:19: Kevin Dyer: I love you very much
07/01/16 07:15:44: Giorgia's Phone: Good Morning! 
It depends on how long you have to sign for: if the renting period is only 6 months, probably you should go for the little apartment regardless.

Hopefully the bigger one works out on Saturday.

I slept fine, still rainy here and 0 desire to go to work!!!! üòÅ

Have a wonderful night!
07/01/16 07:23:39: Kevin Dyer: Poor little muff. Good luck and drive safe

09/01/16 07:51:34: Kevin Dyer: Good morning baby lover. How did you sleep? I saw the cheap place tonight and it was not so good. Bad neighborhood and too small. I submitted an application though and they accepted.  So I will check out the bigger place tomorrow. And hopefully it goes well so I can cancel on the the small place

09/01/16 09:05:02: Giorgia's Phone: Was it 6-months rent agreement or 12-months one? 
In any case keep me updated and good luck for tomorrow:-)
09/01/16 09:05:35: Giorgia's Phone: I'm going to enjoy the sales in the morning and to study in the afternoon!

I think the battery begins to have problems. 
It was a nice day, but supercold and I think I got a coldüòï
Hopefully I will recover by the end of the week for my travel to Prague. 
I'm going to sleep pretty soon because I don't feel so good...just the time of a hot tea. 
I hope you are enjoying your Sunday with Steve and his nice family. 
Talk to you soon.

I thought about how much you have changed my life and the things you have taught me. You taught me that I am capable of so much, and that I should always respect myself and be confident. You taught me to find strength by looking inward rather than outward. You also taught me to love and live life to exhaustion, because we only get one shot at it. You have been such a positive force in my life baby and I want you to know how much you mean to me. I‚Äôll love you till the ends of the earth baby.

20/02/16 08:38:11: Giorgia's Phone: I dreamt that I was visiting you, you were older and successful.

20/02/16 08:39:21: Giorgia's Phone: I saw her door open and the light was on, but I did't enter.
Suddenly it was sunset time and I wanted to come home to prepare for this party.
20/02/16 08:40:36: Giorgia's Phone: Because I changed my mind...at first I didn't want to come with you feeling very out of your life. 
The dream finished that I was in my make up phase.

I was trying to get some coffee (with lots of milk as I like) and to communicate with my dad that incredibly was preparing breakfast for me. Rare event!!!!!!!!!!
I stopped the alarm several times (6-6:10-6:30-7-7:30) and definetely! 
...8 am came so quickly! It is impressive! 
Time seems to pass even faster in mornings when I am in my bed!!!
This is the description of my morning, one of many! 
I miss you too and I am glad you are enjoying a beautiful experience. When we have time, I would love to hear everything about it. 
And I am happy that you , coming back from dinner to the hotel, thought about me ;)

13/03/16 22:55:39: Giorgia's Phone: - section asking for "last occupation abroad if not shown above (include all information requested above)." You completed it with "none". Why?

17/03/16 08:05:20: Kevin Dyer: I would hold you so tight
17/03/16 08:05:46: Kevin Dyer: I talked to Steve a bit and told him what's been going on

17/03/16 08:08:35: Kevin Dyer: He was supportive and wants to help by making things more interesting at work. We are gonna talk more tomorrow
17/03/16 08:12:37: Giorgia's Phone: Nice gesture from him. If I can give you a suggestion, I would put things in a good perspective...like that you do not feel so motivated but that you still have a huge desire to learn and grow. 
Steve is a great guy but you guys still are in a work environment...I would not trust 100%...
17/03/16 08:13:25: Giorgia's Phone: Don't you think your work / side projects are  challenging enough for you?
17/03/16 08:19:24: Kevin Dyer: I trust Steve, he's always been a good guy to me. Work is fine, but it would be nice to switch things up a little. I've been working on the same project forever.
17/03/16 08:20:00: Kevin Dyer: I hear you though, my problem is more internal than external
17/03/16 08:23:01: Giorgia's Phone: What do you think? What is going on inside you?
17/03/16 08:25:08: Kevin Dyer: Idk muff. Just kind of down.

17/03/16 08:33:54: Giorgia's Phone: I don't want to project the problem on me, but I have always been very driven and lately I have not. I think this distant relationship is not ideal both for our minds and bodies
17/03/16 08:34:47: Giorgia's Phone: I would not worry so much if I was you. You should just try to be strong till things will be alright again and naturally
17/03/16 08:34:59: Kevin Dyer: I need you lover. It's true
17/03/16 08:35:20: Giorgia's Phone: In the meantime it is up to you ‚ù§Ô∏è try to find passion and motivation inside you!
17/03/16 08:36:19: Kevin Dyer: I will get back on track soon. And until then I will keep trying my hardest. I know things will get better
17/03/16 08:37:14: Kevin Dyer: Thanks for being so supportive. I know it's not just me who is not doing so well
17/03/16 08:38:05: Kevin Dyer: I am always here for you lover. Through good times and bad. I will always be there for you

15/05/16 11:02:47: Giorgia's Phone: Idk if flights are very convenient for you in terms of hours. Please check it out üòÑüòä
15/05/16 11:03:55: Giorgia's Phone: Ps weather is ok in august in the north of India (not in the south)
For indonesia august is ideal instead

15/05/16 16:51:20: Giorgia's Phone: Muff, I searched a lot for our summer vacation. Both Indonesia and India look great and very different from our culture, that makes the trip even more interesting. Flights are not ideal in terms of hours needed to arrive.
15/05/16 16:52:00: Giorgia's Phone: I am still open to iceland, japan, thailand and any other options you may suggest ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Is everything ok with you? Were you too busy yesterday to text me back?
12/06/16 18:29:17: Kevin Dyer: Hey babe I'm sorry I didn't text you back yesterday. I honestly didn't see you had messaged me. I know it's no excuse. I should have called to say goodnight.

13/06/16 18:25:29: Giorgia's Phone: My iphone does not work so well
13/06/16 18:25:33: Giorgia's Phone: How are you?
13/06/16 18:25:43: Giorgia's Phone: I received the offer in axa
13/06/16 18:31:58: Kevin Dyer: No way!!! Congrats muffin! Are you happy they made the offer?
13/06/16 18:40:30: Giorgia's Phone: Idk
13/06/16 18:41:32: Giorgia's Phone: I'll think about it... They are offering 35k per year+2k linked to company's performance (it could be less or more than it)+3k as premium to enter.
13/06/16 18:43:13: Giorgia's Phone: working from monday to friday morning 

At ey I am at 29k per year+5k as bonus +2 as extrabonus (at least it should be) 
If I stop working with them before 30sept I will not receive any bonus (no 5, no 2)
13/06/16 18:44:20: Giorgia's Phone: Starting from october , after having received 5+2k, I should have 31or 32 k+5 bonus
13/06/16 18:44:38: Giorgia's Phone: What do you think about it?
13/06/16 18:45:23: Giorgia's Phone: Maybe extrabonus as well!
13/06/16 18:45:45: Kevin Dyer: Extra bonus with ey?
13/06/16 19:01:21: Kevin Dyer: Ya 35k is a pretty big bump. I think the bonuses aren't so important because they are taxed so heavily.
13/06/16 19:02:04: Kevin Dyer: Now you have to consider the cost of working with the lady full time, always veeeery close ;p
13/06/16 19:02:44: Kevin Dyer: Considering that, they may need to offer you 1 million!
13/06/16 19:10:27: Kevin Dyer: whatever you decide muff, i am so proud of you. You are such a hard worker and so smart! You deserve the best opportunities in life!
13/06/16 19:16:16: Giorgia's Phone: Thanks babe!

We arrive to Lombok on the 13th, so we have 7 full days. First day would be the waterfalls. Then 14th-16th we do hike. Then we can stay in the south 17th through 19th

26/08/16 23:25:24: Giorgia's Phone: I don't want to change you. I am not chosing to spend my life with you with the aim to transform you in someone different. 
I want to be with YOU because I like you and the way you are. 
But I would love to be free to tell what I think, both positive and negative thoughts. 
I know you are great at your job and very professional. You know it. You know how much I admire you and support you. 
I was grumpy about the goodmorning message (very minimal subject) and I didn't communicate with you in a constructive way (maybe I stressed a subject that was not important at all). I immediately realized it and I didn't like how my words sounded as well. 
But, at the same time, you shouldn't identify my feedback with the fact that I want to change you. 
We are adults and we can discuss to enrich ourself.
Having said that, yes, we are independent and we will always be.
27/08/16 00:11:27: Kevin Dyer: :) muff I'm not one bit worried. You have always respected my space and my individualism. But yes, I always want you to be honest with me
27/08/16 00:11:54: Kevin Dyer: And I will try to not take offense like I did yesterday
27/08/16 08:04:20: Kevin Dyer: Morning love! My sweet berry!

10/11/16 06:38:39: Giorgia's Phone: Ok, I ask only because I am very ashamed and I am worried they can change their opinion about me because of this stupid fact
10/11/16 06:39:02: Giorgia's Phone: I was thinking again about it and I have an idea...Idk if a good one...
10/11/16 06:39:56: Giorgia's Phone: In the instructions state that we should prove hard facts (meaning that we have to prove damages for you in casa you have to move to italy because of the denial) ...
10/11/16 06:40:25: Giorgia's Phone: I think there is a true fact that could help us terribly...other than the fact that you lose your job
10/11/16 06:41:16: Giorgia's Phone: That's Your brother...
10/11/16 06:41:46: Giorgia's Phone: Idk if you have any documentation about "that" fact...

10/11/16 08:31:02: Kevin Dyer: We will get though this no matter what. I love you and I will move out there if I need to.
10/11/16 08:34:45: Giorgia's Phone: I dont prefer it either.
10/11/16 08:35:54: Giorgia's Phone: You decide if you want to do that or not. I cant take such a decision and I dont want to force you on this. 
I only wanted you to consider the idea. 
Once you read the instructions you will have a better idea.
10/11/16 08:36:20: Giorgia's Phone: From my understanding That's not enough we demonstrate that I am a good person...
10/11/16 08:36:37: Giorgia's Phone: Taking off now, sleep well.

15/11/16 21:11:35: Giorgia's Phone: For my crime the maximum is 3 years (not five)
15/11/16 21:11:47: Giorgia's Phone: The rehabilitation in italy means that the crime is cancelled
15/11/16 21:12:06: Giorgia's Phone: I think they were mistaken a little at the embassy.
15/11/16 21:12:29: Giorgia's Phone: This will not be enough to go under 1y max sentence but will help
15/11/16 21:12:35: Giorgia's Phone: Don't you think so?
15/11/16 21:13:01: Giorgia's Phone: (Not four***)
15/11/16 21:13:27: Giorgia's Phone: We don't have in italy the possibility to reclassify a sentence
15/11/16 21:13:49: Giorgia's Phone: Ill try to go and consult another lawyer...to be sure
15/11/16 21:14:20: Giorgia's Phone: Babe, I am confident. Tonight I will work on the first letter and by end of the week we can draft all of them
15/11/16 22:06:21: Giorgia's Phone: Babe how are you?
15/11/16 22:27:15: Giorgia's Phone: Babe?
15/11/16 22:27:42: Kevin Dyer: I'm ok

15/11/16 22:31:56: Giorgia's Phone: Babe, trust me. I have good feelings on that form
15/11/16 22:32:33: Giorgia's Phone: In the same timeI i'm try to reseach and see if We have a plan B
15/11/16 22:33:00: Giorgia's Phone: Is there anything the lawyer told you that you are not tellinh me?
15/11/16 22:35:16: Kevin Dyer: ok babe, sounds good. Ill be more positive tomorrow
15/11/16 22:35:27: Giorgia's Phone: Thanks cake. Be with me.
15/11/16 22:36:09: Kevin Dyer: i told you everything she said other than you will have trouble entering the US even on a tourist visa because the k1 was denied
15/11/16 22:36:20: Kevin Dyer: and that we should have gotten a lawyer from the beginning
15/11/16 22:37:15: Giorgia's Phone: Ok I can try online to submit the request for a Tourist visa
15/11/16 22:37:25: Giorgia's Phone: And see if the deny it...
15/11/16 22:37:40: Giorgia's Phone: Is that a good idea or not in your opinion?
15/11/16 22:37:57: Giorgia's Phone: They*
15/11/16 22:38:20: Kevin Dyer: it only matters if you are trying to visit, which we dont have any plans for that right now
15/11/16 22:38:44: Giorgia's Phone: Ok...
15/11/16 22:39:25: Kevin Dyer: no worries
15/11/16 22:39:28: Kevin Dyer: it was just a detail
15/11/16 22:39:51: Giorgia's Phone: Babe, if you dont want to stay with me in another country, I understand
15/11/16 22:40:02: Giorgia's Phone: But we still have a chance to get through it
15/11/16 22:40:12: Kevin Dyer: babe im not giving up
15/11/16 22:40:20: Kevin Dyer: i just feel down
15/11/16 22:40:28: Giorgia's Phone: Did the lawyer see my crime in detail? Or did she only give a look at it...?
15/11/16 22:40:55: Giorgia's Phone: I think the hardship should be compared to the crime somehow
15/11/16 22:41:24: Giorgia's Phone: I am not a lawyer and I know nothing about it...but it makes sense
15/11/16 22:41:38: Kevin Dyer: agreed
15/11/16 22:42:19: Kevin Dyer: i think you should go to a lawyer that specializes in this
15/11/16 22:42:40: Giorgia's Phone: Ok Ill reseach online
15/11/16 22:43:44: Kevin Dyer: cool babe. Just because you are saying you got your crime erased and you were rehabilitated, but what does that actually mean
15/11/16 22:44:17: Kevin Dyer: (in the eyes of the us immigration)
15/11/16 22:44:54: Giorgia's Phone: It means that in my crime record, near to my crime there is the is the writing "rehabilitated".
15/11/16 22:45:12: Giorgia's Phone: In the italian law, it is equivalent to a redemption.
15/11/16 22:45:24: Giorgia's Phone: No one can see it except for the public administration
15/11/16 22:45:51: Giorgia's Phone: There is not another way to "delete" that crime for me
15/11/16 22:45:57: Giorgia's Phone: That was the maximum
15/11/16 22:46:04: Kevin Dyer: i know muff
15/11/16 22:47:27: Kevin Dyer: i dont mean for you to explain it to me, i just mean we need to translate those meanings to this visa process. Like should we have even needed to mention the crime?
15/11/16 22:47:38: Giorgia's Phone: Yes
15/11/16 22:49:02: Giorgia's Phone: Because today the lawyer explained that the embassy can see the database with all crimes of people
15/11/16 22:49:04: Kevin Dyer: you didnt mention it in your student visa though and they never said anything about it
15/11/16 22:49:21: Giorgia's Phone: They never asked for my crime records in my student visa
15/11/16 22:49:42: Giorgia's Phone: Plus it still was a pending proceeding
15/11/16 22:49:44: Kevin Dyer: interesting
15/11/16 22:50:20: Giorgia's Phone: Babe, I think we will be fine
15/11/16 22:50:33: Kevin Dyer: k babe
15/11/16 22:50:42: Giorgia's Phone: If you read the examples in the links I have sent you... E
15/11/16 22:50:54: Giorgia's Phone: They say three months on average...
15/11/16 22:51:20: Kevin Dyer: so you think we should just fill it out and submit it without seeing another lawyer?
15/11/16 22:51:33: Giorgia's Phone: The lawyer confirmed that The max sentence is 3y, not 4
15/11/16 22:51:55: Giorgia's Phone: Should I try to contact the embassy and ask for clarifications about it?
15/11/16 22:52:07: Kevin Dyer: totally
15/11/16 22:52:09: Giorgia's Phone: In the paper of denial they wrote 4
15/11/16 22:52:23: Giorgia's Phone: Ok. Should I try via email?
15/11/16 22:52:25: Kevin Dyer: right
15/11/16 22:53:12: Kevin Dyer: but the lawyer i talked to was saying it should be less than a year, so maybe that detail is not so important. im not sure
15/11/16 22:53:48: Giorgia's Phone: Idk either
Regarding your question
15/11/16 22:54:08: Giorgia's Phone: I think i will consult another lawyer or two.
15/11/16 22:54:15: Kevin Dyer: i want to help however I can too
15/11/16 22:54:27: Giorgia's Phone: But, I dont want to lose time...
15/11/16 22:54:38: Giorgia's Phone: So in the meantime we should work on the form
15/11/16 22:55:27: Giorgia's Phone: It's not so immediate for you to get all documents (from the doctors and others) ready shortly
15/11/16 22:55:29: Kevin Dyer: maybe you can try emailing the embassy tonight to ask if 3yr max makes a difference
15/11/16 22:55:42: Giorgia's Phone: So if dont activate, it could potentially take a longer time

15/11/16 22:56:52: Giorgia's Phone: It is written that to avoid it, I should have received a sentence less that 6 months (which is in line with my case) with a max sentence of less than 1y
15/11/16 22:57:01: Giorgia's Phone: Ok that is good.
15/11/16 22:57:32: Giorgia's Phone: I think i can get mine done and ready by the 28th
15/11/16 22:57:56: Giorgia's Phone: (Translators take about 1 week) 
You should email the original copies to me
15/11/16 22:58:05: Giorgia's Phone: So I can send all together
15/11/16 22:58:29: Giorgia's Phone: Can we do it by ourselves?
15/11/16 23:00:40: Giorgia's Phone: What do you think?
15/11/16 23:01:53: Giorgia's Phone: I want to get all done to be sent in the next couple weeks, in the meantime Ill consult with another two lawyers and -if they see a plan B - we can go for it
15/11/16 23:01:55: Kevin Dyer: So I need to have a doctor's appointment?
15/11/16 23:02:15: Kevin Dyer: and what else?
15/11/16 23:03:59: Giorgia's Phone: Yeah. 
So, let me think...
On the doctor side:
- you: evidence that you were depressed in the past; 
- you: the stress indicator; 
- collin: bipolarism.
Any other evidences you think that may be helpful (that links you to your brother...you mention some arrests...can u prove something?)
15/11/16 23:04:35: Kevin Dyer: i can get it together
15/11/16 23:04:53: Kevin Dyer: i dont know what proof I can give regarding my brother
15/11/16 23:06:41: Giorgia's Phone: Financially:
- your job (like the one you produced for the k1, I have a copy but if we can get the original that is better) stating the K per year you earn;
- tax return;
- anything else you think that is helpful (have a look to the instructions pls)
15/11/16 23:07:24: Giorgia's Phone: Your brother could be a pretty important point. Cant you get anything about his bipolarism?
15/11/16 23:08:26: Giorgia's Phone: If Something more comes to my mond I will update u
15/11/16 23:08:30: Giorgia's Phone: Mind*

15/11/16 23:09:49: Kevin Dyer: i gotta get back to work and you should get some sleep

15/11/16 23:09:54: Giorgia's Phone: Other than what I stated...it's important you read and research online.

20/11/16 08:18:16: Kevin Dyer: Morning little flower!
20/11/16 10:08:34: Kevin Dyer: Night love cake
20/11/16 10:22:07: Giorgia's Phone: Night night
20/11/16 12:06:35: Giorgia's Phone: starting from today i want to react, The denial really impacted on me causing a strong stress that made me sick and I lost some weight too.
I felt refused and most of all humiliated...also because you had to reveal my mistake to part of your family (i am not saying this is your fault, but I feel very ashamed for the error i made and I am worried your family can judge me basing on something that is out of normal, that was stupid and irrational).
This morning I talked to my mom and she pushed me to go out and see friends, to eat a little more.
Except for work I have not seen any of my friends since the visa interview and I spent the last 2 we at home by myself. 
It's time to react, I want to believe that everything will be ok with this new form. I want to hope and honestly I really think that if they judge the overall situation they will approve it.
If not, our love is demonstrating an impressive strength and we will handle this situation together. 
Wherever, but together. 
I dont want to cry anymore, I will be strong and positive. 
I shouldn't have such a rush to submit the form, better wait couple of weeks but have all we need.
Most of all, I dont want to argue with you. We are a team and I want to protect our love!
Sleep well cake.
20/11/16 20:05:25: Kevin Dyer: Aw my sweetheart! I didn't realize it was affecting you so dramatically! Babe I don't want you to worry one bit. Our love is so strong. I am so incredibly in love with you, this cannot stop us from being together. Yes I'm scared to move to Italy but I am so much more scared to lose you. I will follow you to the ends of the earth my love!!!!

You can decide if we should go with him or with the girl.
Arrived to this point I dont care so much about the money, but mostly about the result..I can pay half of 3 or half of 4.5 indifferently...I am willing to pay more if you think he is the better choice, but I dont want to force you.

Good that you are sleeping at collin's. 
No driving for my muffin! 

Ps I read the email you sent to the lawyer , thanks for replying back to him.
Only two considerations: 
1. the therapist has to be contacted by the lawyer (at least this is what Giuseppe wrote in his previous email) so do not contact Susan directly;
2. For Next time we write to him: it is more efficient - in my opinion - to  indicate directly a couple or so of your availabilities (accordingly with the time zone difference) so he can pick between your options.
Preferably beginning of the next week (monday or tuesday) so we do not waste time.
25/11/16 17:43:20: Giorgia's Phone: Buongiorno. üòÑ
25/11/16 17:43:37: Giorgia's Phone: I replied to the lawyer, he was not happy about your answerüòÅ

Night!
04/12/16 10:26:48: Giorgia's Phone: I don't know why you are treating me like this, not replying to my messages (like you do with all other people including your ex gfs) and making me feel that working on the hardship is something so extremely difficult for you. It should be something you want to do right away because it means a step forward to be together, but maybe this is not the case for you.
Maybe you are not even alone tonight and this is the reason why you cant reply back to me, maybe I am dreaming about something that will never happen because you do not really want it.
04/12/16 10:27:48: Giorgia's Phone: I feel extremely sad, if you care something about it.

Its not easy. Its not that I am looking forward to work on the waiver, but it has a strong meaning and effect on our future
05/12/16 06:59:53: Giorgia's Phone: This letter, this waiver could change completely our future so it is worthed an effort

05/12/16 07:56:47: Giorgia's Phone: A. i would add only a reference to your brother as well in the last episode (that you explain in the next paragraph)
05/12/16 07:58:51: Giorgia's Phone: B. Maybe the second episode (2010) is a little too detailed on your carrier path but I woul suggest to keep it as it is and add a comment so Giuseppe can modify it
05/12/16 07:58:51: Kevin Dyer: Let's just chat when you can
05/12/16 07:59:07: Kevin Dyer: Ok

05/12/16 08:24:23: Giorgia's Phone: - points: 
A.when you talk about the law chance to get a good job in italy, stress the fact that you eventually have to quit your job that makes you gain about 130k per year and that you are very passionate about
05/12/16 08:25:19: Giorgia's Phone: B. That once unemployed in italy you have first of all to be re-educated and to study italian before you can apply to any job (taking consider amount of time and money)
05/12/16 08:25:36: Kevin Dyer: Make 130* not gain
05/12/16 08:25:48: Giorgia's Phone: C. Being unemployed means that you cannot pay back your student loan

05/12/16 08:41:59: Giorgia's Phone: Or we should wait until you read the examples and make more edits?
05/12/16 08:44:04: Kevin Dyer: I say we share it with him. We can always make more edits later. But I want to get his feedback first
05/12/16 08:44:20: Giorgia's Phone: I agree
05/12/16 08:45:10: Kevin Dyer: So whenever you feel ready, send it off. Or maybe add their emails to the doc so we always have the current copy
05/12/16 08:46:36: Giorgia's Phone: Ok , ill do both so he can decide if he wants to work online or offline
05/12/16 08:47:28: Giorgia's Phone: Can i call?

19/01/17 08:20:52: Giorgia's Phone: I understand...
A little worried that our lives will make us feel more distant day after day, but probably it is only an irrational fear of mine.
Maybe it's only matter of adjusting, we will see.
In any case I will not ask you to make more time for me, I understand and I do not want to receive grumpy answers anymore.
Life is already pretty difficult, so I will avoid argues I can avoidüòâ
19/01/17 08:22:01: Giorgia's Phone: I understand that you will be focused on your new job  and you will do great, I am sure!
19/01/17 08:26:14: Kevin Dyer: Aw babe I'm sorry if I've seemed grumpy lately. Maybe I'm just too focused on the new job. But I haven't stopped loving you one bit. I will always be there for you! I love you muff!

I want you to be happy and fulfilled, and loved.
Sometimes life goes so fast and we cannot even control it...and we have only a little space to share our thoughts, for our conversations.
But I love you and I am waiting for you. I am waiting for that moment when we are together to come.

24/03/17 05:29:56: Kevin Dyer: Good morning lover!
24/03/17 05:30:23: Kevin Dyer: Here is your double encrypted code:
IM1SYOUAl23414
24/03/17 05:34:50: Kevin Dyer: this is the message in english babe, incase the translation is not good:

Good Morning everyone! Today I hope you will join me on an adventurous cryptography treasure hunt. 

Back story:
Hi. My name is Hank, I am a rich business man who is well respected in my circles. I talk fast, and drive even faster. I wear Italian suites and say things like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt go behind my back!‚Äù and, ‚ÄúI need that right away!‚Äù. Needless to say, I am kind of a big deal.

Today though, I‚Äôm in trouble and I need your help. I just got paid big time on my last deal and I thought I was in the clear. That was until things turned south. I need to leave the country for a while until things blow over but I can‚Äôt take all that money with me out of the country. They‚Äôll notice!

Thats where you three come in. I need to send you some cash anonymously without the police being able to trace it back to me. It won‚Äôt be easy. I have doubly encrypted the access code I will send you and I need you three to work together to decode the message and secure my money.

Hope you are up for the challenge!

Giorgia, I will send you the encrypted message. Giancarlo and Graziella, I will send both of you a cipher to decode this very fun and interesting puzzle.
The order you use the ciphers is very important. The only hint I can give about the order is that you should be polite and have good manners.

When the code has been decrypted, enter it here to collect your money.
www.amazon.it/utilizzare-buono-regalo

Not one of you can solve this on your own. You need to work together and use all the information you have to decode this. Good luck!

23/05/17 00:54:05: Giorgia's Phone: <‚Äéaudio omitted>
23/05/17 01:03:11: Kevin Dyer: night sweet heart

23/05/17 08:55:07: Giorgia's Phone: If not I can call you in about 5- 10 mins!
23/05/17 08:59:04: Kevin Dyer: Ok babe let's talk for a little
23/05/17 14:26:51: Giorgia's Phone: Good morning love! I checked online and it seems like you can legally enter and stay in italy for a maximum of 90 days
23/05/17 14:27:53: Giorgia's Phone: Once you marry me, you can stay but without the wedding , if you stay more than 90 days, you will be illegal and the situation can get very complicated!
23/05/17 14:28:40: Giorgia's Phone: You can stay 90 days every 180 days , so let's say you spend 90 days you have to wait at least another 90 days before you can come again
23/05/17 14:29:44: Giorgia's Phone: This piece of information impacts on what you can tell and not tell to your boas
23/05/17 14:30:04: Giorgia's Phone: Boss*
23/05/17 14:33:39: Giorgia's Phone: Furthermore, consider that I'll probably have 2 to 3 weeks of vacation (2 weeks minimum) in August so it would be great if you can stay in Italy for that month so I can have lots of time to cuddle youüòä
23/05/17 14:33:59: Giorgia's Phone: This fact of 3 months is kind of a bummer! üôàüò¢
23/05/17 17:08:55: Kevin Dyer: Morning
23/05/17 17:14:37: Giorgia's Phone: üòò
23/05/17 17:48:23: Kevin Dyer: Ya it's a bummer for sure
23/05/17 17:49:00: Kevin Dyer: Thanks for checking my love
23/05/17 17:49:58: Giorgia's Phone: What do u think about it?
23/05/17 17:50:03: Giorgia's Phone: Yes, of course ;)
23/05/17 18:55:05: Kevin Dyer: It would be hard to go for only a few months, only to have to come back, find another apartment and wait longer
23/05/17 19:00:09: Giorgia's Phone: I see
23/05/17 19:00:28: Giorgia's Phone: I understand your point
23/05/17 19:04:47: Giorgia's Phone: As you think it's better, of course I dont want you to move here for three months to represent an issue for you
23/05/17 19:05:04: Giorgia's Phone: You decide what is better for you
23/05/17 19:10:56: Kevin Dyer: Maybe it makes sense to wait till after July 4th so there is a better chance we can stay together.
23/05/17 19:11:38: Kevin Dyer: Don't think I don't want to come, I'm just thinking babe! Considering everything
23/05/17 19:11:55: Giorgia's Phone: Why after July 4th?
23/05/17 19:12:05: Giorgia's Phone: You mean after your trip?
23/05/17 19:12:14: Kevin Dyer: That's when I have the reunion
23/05/17 19:12:23: Giorgia's Phone: I see
23/05/17 19:12:30: Giorgia's Phone: Yes, its not a problem for me
23/05/17 19:12:47: Kevin Dyer: Can I call?
23/05/17 19:12:53: Giorgia's Phone: But I dont understand the "better chance"
23/05/17 19:12:56: Giorgia's Phone: Yes
23/05/17 19:35:37: Kevin Dyer: the 90 day thing only applies to tourist and business visas. I could try to apply for a residence permit instead
23/05/17 19:35:46: Kevin Dyer: not sure how long it will take though
23/05/17 19:35:55: Kevin Dyer: what do you think?
23/05/17 19:47:44: Giorgia's Phone: What are the requirements for you to apply for a residence permit?
23/05/17 19:48:31: Giorgia's Phone: And mostly, do you think this will affect the waiver which is based on the fact that coming to Italy would represent a great damage for you?
23/05/17 19:49:07: Giorgia's Phone: Honestly I think that most "secure" way to stay together (now that the waiver is ongoing) is not to ask for a permanent visa
23/05/17 19:49:51: Giorgia's Phone: If you come here for vacation the officers in charge of reviewing our waiver cant say a thing
23/05/17 19:50:33: Giorgia's Phone: But if you do something more, it could potentially impact in their analysis...that's my point of view (not expert - we could ask to Giuseppe
23/05/17 19:50:49: Giorgia's Phone: If we want a professional advice under paymentüòú)
23/05/17 19:51:11: Kevin Dyer: interesting
23/05/17 19:51:11: Kevin Dyer: good point
23/05/17 19:51:33: Kevin Dyer: yes, giuseppe will be happy to help... for a small fee
23/05/17 19:51:38: Kevin Dyer: 10000000000000000000 $
23/05/17 19:51:42: Giorgia's Phone: Ahahah
23/05/17 19:52:51: Giorgia's Phone: I dont know love but we should consider every step we make
23/05/17 19:53:03: Giorgia's Phone: Before wasting all we have built until now
23/05/17 19:58:32: Kevin Dyer: you are right
23/05/17 19:58:59: Kevin Dyer: maybe i can sneak in on a boat
23/05/17 19:59:03: Giorgia's Phone: Ahahahahahah
23/05/17 19:59:07: Giorgia's Phone: Be illegal ahahahha
23/05/17 19:59:12: Giorgia's Phone: Trump is here today!
23/05/17 19:59:33: Giorgia's Phone: Shall I say hi for you? He's coming to pet Briciola and Schona!
23/05/17 19:59:36: Giorgia's Phone: Lol!
23/05/17 19:59:45: Kevin Dyer: haha
23/05/17 20:08:34: Kevin Dyer: Man, this is such a tough situation. So many things to consider. So many stupid rules
23/05/17 20:08:48: Kevin Dyer: I just want to be with my muffin!
23/05/17 20:14:48: Giorgia's Phone: I want to be with you!
23/05/17 20:14:59: Giorgia's Phone: We will be together soon love!
23/05/17 20:15:41: Kevin Dyer: i hope puffer
23/05/17 20:16:32: Giorgia's Phone: Yes!
23/05/17 20:19:51: Kevin Dyer: your absolutely right muff, we need to stay positive
23/05/17 20:22:48: Giorgia's Phone: This is the only way!
23/05/17 20:22:54: Giorgia's Phone: Now focus on your job
23/05/17 20:23:04: Giorgia's Phone: And we talk during your lunch:)
23/05/17 20:25:40: Kevin Dyer: kk
23/05/17 20:25:54: Kevin Dyer: after lunch, going out with coworkers
23/05/17 21:30:58: Kevin Dyer: Almost ready?
23/05/17 21:31:12: Giorgia's Phone: Yes
23/05/17 21:31:23: Giorgia's Phone: Take your time!
23/05/17 22:51:22: Giorgia's Phone: The most updated statistics on the uscic website (updated today but based on data as of 31 March): the Nebraska office is processing waivers submitted on 26 may 2016.
Considering that the update relates to end of March (almost 2 months ago), my guess is that right now they are processing at least end of july 2016...
23/05/17 22:52:41: Giorgia's Phone: That means about 5 more months at the maximum and if you can come here for three months we can make it! ‚ò∫Ô∏è its going to be fine!
23/05/17 23:06:14: Giorgia's Phone: Night‚ò∫Ô∏è
23/05/17 23:14:22: Kevin Dyer: great babe! what an investigator!
