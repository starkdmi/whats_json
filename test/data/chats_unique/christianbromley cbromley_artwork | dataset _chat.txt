[21/05/2018, 07:13:19] Sam Gray Actual: What's the average rent prices saying in manc
[21/05/2018, 07:13:24] Sam Gray Actual: Doing some life research
[21/05/2018, 07:50:57] Keith Hill: 😂
[21/05/2018, 07:53:02] Keith Hill: So a 1 bed I'd say is between 600 and 750. A 2 bed roughly 800 to 900. A 3 bed 1200 to 1600.

So basically in shared property i've never paid more than 450 and that's when I had an en suite. Currently pay 425 but we do live in flats in castlefield. 

People in work have places for like 1000 for 3 people and pay 300 quid
[21/05/2018, 07:53:22] Keith Hill: But they live in rougher areas
[21/05/2018, 07:53:25] Keith Hill: That help?
[21/05/2018, 07:54:05] Keith Hill: Tanja also pays 425 but lives in a nice flat in Salford quays. (That's all before bills), but you can get some really good deals if you look hard enough
[21/05/2018, 07:54:50] Keith Hill: Like I know people doing like 450 all in bills included and I swear any and Maria used to pay like nothing for their flat because through a friend
[21/05/2018, 07:55:59] Sam Gray Actual: A lot to take in there 😂
[21/05/2018, 07:56:46] Sam Gray Actual: Yeah thanks
Very comprehensive analysis there
[21/05/2018, 07:56:49] Sam Gray Actual: Many thanks
[21/05/2018, 07:57:01] Keith Hill: You're welcome 😂
[21/05/2018, 07:57:27] Sam Gray Actual: Can't actually afford to live anywhere apart from a wheelie bin at the moment so
[21/05/2018, 07:57:37] Christian Bromley: Haha
[21/05/2018, 07:58:25] Christian Bromley: Yeah rent is not expensive here really. Obviously if you live further out you can get even naughtier deals
[21/05/2018, 07:58:43] Christian Bromley: But some of the areas you wouldn’t want to live in like
[21/05/2018, 07:59:41] Keith Hill: I managed to live here on 20k taxed so it's doable like
[21/05/2018, 08:00:30] Christian Bromley: Yeah the only expensive part is the boozing 😂
[21/05/2018, 08:00:48] Keith Hill: True that 😂
[21/05/2018, 08:02:02] Sam Gray Actual: Hahah yeah classic ale spends
[21/05/2018, 08:02:31] Sam Gray Actual: KL rinses me for pints
[21/05/2018, 08:02:58] Sam Gray Actual: But we don't pay for rent so that's gonna be harsh when I have to do that, like a proper human
[21/05/2018, 08:12:41] Keith Hill: You'll undoubtedly get a pay rise coming to England so should cover it old boy
[21/05/2018, 08:13:15] Keith Hill: Cocaine is expensive too. Factor that in
[21/05/2018, 08:13:55] Sam Gray Actual: I haven't even got a job never mind a pay rise kid
[21/05/2018, 08:14:37] Sam Gray Actual: Nah jobs aren't looking that well paid . Want to a pgce next year so stuck in a pickle

[09/08/2018, 17:31:28] Sam Gray Actual: Throw teeth at them
[09/08/2018, 17:33:43] Christian Bromley: So infuriating haha
[09/08/2018, 17:34:06] Christian Bromley: This kind of stuff
[09/08/2018, 17:34:09] Christian Bromley: And getting rid of the 7 will lead to over eruption and cause the 8 to be more non functional when it inevitably tips. 7 could have filling and maybe rct in further. Be straight forward after 8 is gone with recession.
Most people born without 8s but would hate a gap between 6 and 8 for food etc!
That is why I will take that out tomorrow privately for 500 pound
[09/08/2018, 17:34:17] Christian Bromley: Lots of talk of 7s and 8a
[09/08/2018, 17:35:10] Sam Gray Actual: Hahaha wow

[09/06/2019, 06:39:38] Christian Bromley: Early start for Sam. By the way I am still keen to go this festival in Cambridge in two weeks. It is a little pricey however just for one day/night so I’m unsure if people would be keen. Would be £80 for ticket/camping. It’s fucking class though. May be slight pain to get to without a car but can probs get a taxi to/from Cambridge. I’m keen like but would be expensive weekend. Could do something on the Friday as well  to make weekend of it
[09/06/2019, 06:39:55] Christian Bromley: https://www.thewildwooddisco.com/tickets
[09/06/2019, 06:40:04] Sam Final Gray: Train to Cambridge? From London ?

[09/06/2019, 07:07:44] Christian Bromley: Yeah we would take train from LDN to Cam then get a taxi from there to the event. It’s about half hour out of cam. May actually be able to get train somewhere closer il have a look. You can take ale to the campsite but they stop you taking it into the woods
[09/06/2019, 07:14:16] Christian Bromley: Actually there’s a stop called whittlesford parkway that’s closer
[09/06/2019, 16:36:42] Keith Hill: Hahaha eventful night for the lids

[13/03/2020, 22:16:02] Christian Bromley: Two questions for you.
[13/03/2020, 22:16:20] Christian Bromley: Have you got one bollock bigger than the other?
[13/03/2020, 22:16:27] Christian Bromley: If yes, is it left or right?
[13/03/2020, 22:16:40] Christian Bromley: Third question. Are left or right handed?
[13/03/2020, 22:24:00] Sam Final Gray: Pardon
[13/03/2020, 22:24:25] Keith Hill: Right handed
[13/03/2020, 22:24:28] Keith Hill: Sam the only lefty
[13/03/2020, 22:24:47] Sam Final Gray: I’d say fairly similar but probably left bigger
[13/03/2020, 22:24:53] Sam Final Gray: My left not stage left
[13/03/2020, 22:37:31] Smith Tom: Yeah left bigger
[13/03/2020, 22:37:39] Smith Tom: Droopy

[13/03/2020, 22:45:17] Christian Bromley: Thanks lads
[13/03/2020, 22:45:53] Christian Bromley: Big debate here
[13/03/2020, 22:46:04] Christian Bromley: Apparently girls boobs tend to be bigger on the left
[13/03/2020, 22:46:11] Christian Bromley: I’m trying to rubbish that hypothesis
[13/03/2020, 23:03:26] Keith Hill: I reckon both my bolicks are big like
[13/03/2020, 23:03:35] Keith Hill: Same size
[13/03/2020, 23:03:37] Keith Hill: Just big
[13/03/2020, 23:04:37] Christian Bromley: Consensus on bollocks is no correlation with handedness
[13/03/2020, 23:07:37] Sam Final Gray: 😂
[14/03/2020, 00:04:15] Keith Hill: I reckon Sean’s got some big bollocks
[14/03/2020, 00:11:24] Christian Bromley: Strong correlation between handedness and size of left or right boob

So negative so judging
[07/01/2021, 19:03:18] Sam Final Gray: Muted it but just non stop pops up
[07/01/2021, 19:03:58] Sam Final Gray: God bless good night
[07/01/2021, 19:12:26] Tom Dennis: I literally have no other mates or interactions with people with those views, so can be an eye opener. I just take it with a pinch of salt and as a way to see how some others actually think
[07/01/2021, 19:34:19] Smith Tom: I only saw the beginning of this and thought bloody hell Dennis bit heavy tonight. Back on the vino rouge

[07/01/2021, 20:39:38] Sam Final Gray: Bit pointless because you can just say ignore limit when you reach it 😂 thought it would lock me out
[07/01/2021, 20:42:25] Keith Hill: Enjoyed this haha
[07/01/2021, 20:43:51] Keith Hill: I’ve had the group muted for a very long time now. Cba with the pending wind ups. Hardly use social media these days either. Easier life.

[07/01/2021, 21:10:32] Tom Dennis: Archived it just pops back when someone speaks lol
[07/01/2021, 21:10:40] Tom Dennis: I did enjoy my spell on the sidelines

[08/01/2021, 10:43:46] Sam Final Gray: Surely not
[08/01/2021, 10:44:03] Smith Tom: Also didnt realise it's 20% of £6 a week, so not quite as lucrative as first thought
[08/01/2021, 10:44:11] Smith Tom: But still about £65
[08/01/2021, 10:44:28] Sam Final Gray: £1.20 😂
