11/6/18, 12:21 PM - Divya Cs: <Media omitted>
11/6/18, 12:28 PM - Jenit Jain: I have no idea
11/6/18, 12:28 PM - Jenit Jain: I copied it from sahil
11/6/18, 12:32 PM - Divya Cs: Ohhhh Oki 
Thanks :)
11/8/18, 1:20 PM - Jenit Jain: What was your question
11/8/18, 1:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Explain na
11/8/18, 2:14 PM - Divya Cs: There was 2 parts A and B 
A was normal preemptive priority scheduling 
B was extend the preemptive priority to include aging so for every clock cycle decrement priority of all processes except the currently executing one and those that have priority 0 
(0 is highest priority) 
Once all reach highest priority the system degrades to FCFS
11/8/18, 2:22 PM - Jenit Jain: How did you do part B
11/8/18, 2:24 PM - Divya Cs: You add an aging function and an isMaxPri function to your normal code for preemptive priority
11/8/18, 2:26 PM - Divya Cs: After selecting the process to execute i.e minimum priority 
Call aging 
Then normally execute 
Check if isMaxPri
I.e of all priorities are 0
If they are then finish executing current process and then call the FCFS function
11/8/18, 2:26 PM - Divya Cs: The code for preemptive priority is pretty similar to SRTF
11/8/18, 2:27 PM - Divya Cs: Just check priorities instead of burst times
11/8/18, 3:12 PM - Jenit Jain: If all priorities aren't Max then next process is chosen with the lowest priority and the earliest arrival time right
11/8/18, 3:12 PM - Divya Cs: Yupp
11/8/18, 3:12 PM - Divya Cs: Well not necessarily earliest arrival time
11/8/18, 3:12 PM - Divya Cs: Just earlier than current time
11/8/18, 3:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah I mean if 2 processes have 0 priority then earliest arrival time right
11/8/18, 3:16 PM - Divya Cs: Ya
11/9/18, 8:36 AM - Jenit Jain: Listen
11/9/18, 8:36 AM - Jenit Jain: After how many quants did you have to call the aging function
11/9/18, 8:37 AM - Jenit Jain: Just let me know when you'll be free for 5 mins
11/9/18, 8:37 AM - Jenit Jain: I'll call
11/9/18, 9:13 AM - Divya Cs: Not after a time quantum 
You age for every clock cycle
11/9/18, 9:32 AM - Jenit Jain: Oh
11/9/18, 9:32 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay thanks
11/9/18, 9:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Also, you don't need to implement a separate fcfs function right? Because as soon as the all the processes have minimum priority, whenever the priority function is called ,as soon as the first process with 0 priority is found, the process will execute
11/9/18, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: So all the processes will finish in line.
11/9/18, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Which is fcfs
11/9/18, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: So it's fine right?
11/9/18, 9:42 AM - Divya Cs: It should be
I implemented a seperate fcfs function tho
11/9/18, 9:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Alright thanks
11/18/18, 10:15 AM - Jenit Jain: Which oe are you planning to take

3/23/19, 10:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Who am I kidding with pictures
3/23/19, 10:15 PM - Divya Cs: Optimistic
3/24/19, 11:44 PM - Jenit Jain: No fucking idea if it is b or c
3/24/19, 11:44 PM - Jenit Jain: But mostly c
3/24/19, 11:44 PM - Divya Cs: Its a really stupid question if the answer is c
3/24/19, 11:45 PM - Divya Cs: Like you earn 1000 per year 
What's the annual amount
3/24/19, 11:45 PM - Jenit Jain: But because they gave interest rate, it creates a doubt
3/24/19, 11:45 PM - Jenit Jain: But annual equivalent amount should be c only
3/24/19, 11:51 PM - Divya Cs: That's what I thought too
3/24/19, 11:51 PM - Divya Cs: But what kind of question is that
3/24/19, 11:54 PM - Jenit Jain: The one we need
3/24/19, 11:57 PM - Divya Cs: üôà
3/24/19, 11:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Can you explain the 18k. Term
3/25/19, 12:03 AM - Divya Cs: 18k is an infinite annual payment
3/25/19, 12:04 AM - Divya Cs: The formula for A/i in the CC equation expands to 
A(P/A,i, infinity)
3/25/19, 12:05 AM - Divya Cs: So 18000/i is the same as finding P given amount A for time t
3/25/19, 12:05 AM - Divya Cs: Except t is infinity here
3/25/19, 12:05 AM - Divya Cs: Now once you find P at year 4 you need to bring that to year 0 for present worth
3/25/19, 12:06 AM - Divya Cs: So (F/P,i,4)
3/25/19, 12:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Can't you just frame it as, 
You have to shift the infinite 18k payment by 4 years to the left of the cfd so that it seems that he payments start from year 0, that's why 18k*p/f and then that's basically A, and then you divide by i that I know. So can you say this makes sense too
3/25/19, 12:11 AM - Divya Cs: Ya I think so
3/25/19, 12:11 AM - Jenit Jain: Good luck for the vague exam lollllll
3/25/19, 12:12 AM - Divya Cs: Thanks 
I think I need it üôà

3/30/19, 4:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude is Bayesian theory Linear or non Linear
3/30/19, 4:04 PM - Jenit Jain: And in it the number of training instances per class changes the output na
3/30/19, 4:04 PM - Jenit Jain: What is this called?
3/30/19, 4:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Local something na
3/30/19, 4:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Like some technical word
3/30/19, 4:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Is it called class likelihood
3/30/19, 7:50 PM - Divya Cs: Local models?
3/30/19, 7:50 PM - Divya Cs: K means clustering?
3/30/19, 7:50 PM - Divya Cs: I'm not really sure what you're referring to
3/31/19, 2:20 AM - Jenit Jain: Same reaction when the interviewer asked me that loll

FUUCK no
3/31/19, 6:45 AM - Jenit Jain: All existing birds can fly except 2
3/31/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: For all a bird(a) and fly (a) and (there exists x,y bird (x) and not fly (x) and bird (y) and not fly (y) and (x not equal to y)
3/31/19, 7:23 AM - Jenit Jain: And in the 13th question, in the production S -> a.AB , you have to add the closure elements of A to the item set and the lookahead symbol will be first of B or follow of A only?
3/31/19, 7:24 AM - Jenit Jain: And if it is first or B then do we have to put the epsilon in the lookahead symbol for the closure items? It doesn't make sense but I'm asking anyway
3/31/19, 7:35 AM - Jenit Jain: And how many states for this one
3/31/19, 9:20 AM - Divya Cs: Yup
3/31/19, 9:20 AM - Divya Cs: First of B
3/31/19, 9:21 AM - Divya Cs: And if first of B is epsilon then it'll be $
3/31/19, 9:21 AM - Divya Cs: 18states I think
3/31/19, 9:21 AM - Divya Cs: 0-17
3/31/19, 9:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Or 16
3/31/19, 9:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Do you remember getting $,c lookahead for few states
3/31/19, 9:23 AM - Divya Cs: Ya vaguely
3/31/19, 9:23 AM - Divya Cs: If you've done it send me a picture and I'll check it if you want

4/2/19, 4:12 PM - Jenit Jain: 4*4 matrix of letters
4/2/19, 4:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Divide it into 4 quadrants and send elements of each quadrant to a process
4/2/19, 4:13 PM - Jenit Jain: And then you had to check a small thing
4/2/19, 4:13 PM - Jenit Jain: But mainly only sending
4/2/19, 4:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Which is what I couldn't do
4/2/19, 4:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Bt
4/2/19, 4:14 PM - Divya Cs: Auyy fuck

4/2/19, 5:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Found what I did wrong

Not promising anything cuz I literally just woke up
4/5/19, 7:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Hello fren
4/5/19, 7:12 PM - Jenit Jain: In LR(1) grammar, to find the lookahead symbol lets say we have A-> a.B,$
4/5/19, 7:12 PM - Jenit Jain: What will be the look ahead for the productions if B
4/5/19, 7:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Will it be$
4/5/19, 7:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Or do you find the follow from the original grammar
4/5/19, 7:34 PM - Divya Cs: It'll be $
4/5/19, 7:35 PM - Divya Cs: If you have 
A -> a.BC , $
Then the lookahead is first(C) and if that has E then it'll be $
4/5/19, 7:38 PM - Jenit Jain: üî• thanks
4/5/19, 8:18 PM - Divya Cs: üòä
4/5/19, 8:25 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/5/19, 8:26 PM - Divya Cs: Why would there be ( in follow of S
4/5/19, 8:26 PM - Divya Cs: S is followed by )
4/5/19, 8:34 PM - Jenit Jain: But the second S in that production is followed by null so you add the first of the production symbol no
4/5/19, 8:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Which is S
4/5/19, 8:38 PM - Divya Cs: Follow of S is follow of S'
4/5/19, 8:38 PM - Divya Cs: And that's $
4/5/19, 8:38 PM - Divya Cs: To break the loop
4/5/19, 8:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck fuck I confused those rules nvm
4/5/19, 8:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
4/5/19, 8:52 PM - Jenit Jain: What is it has E along other variables
4/5/19, 8:52 PM - Jenit Jain: If*
4/5/19, 8:58 PM - Divya Cs: Then it's other variables,E
4/5/19, 8:59 PM - Divya Cs: If C->bcD|E
Lookahead b,c,$
4/5/19, 8:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Huh
4/5/19, 8:59 PM - Jenit Jain: What
4/5/19, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: E you mean epsilon right
4/5/19, 9:00 PM - Divya Cs: A->a.BC
C-> bcD|epsilon
4/5/19, 9:01 PM - Divya Cs: Lookahead 
b,c,$ for B
4/5/19, 9:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh so you always just put$instead? Like always for epsilon?
4/5/19, 9:11 PM - Divya Cs: Yaa

4/22/19, 11:59 PM - Jenit Jain: :)
4/23/19, 12:00 AM - Divya Cs: In stock turnover ratio
4/23/19, 12:00 AM - Divya Cs: The numerator won't it be cost of goods sold and not net sales?
4/23/19, 12:01 AM - Jenit Jain: Bhai a CA solved these questions. I'm just accepting it at this point
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Divya Cs: I'll also accept
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Divya Cs: Idk what's happening
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Divya Cs: I miss engineering :c
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Jenit Jain: To use cost of good you also need opening stock which isn't giving so that's why using net sales/ closing inventory
4/23/19, 12:02 AM - Divya Cs: Ohh okayy
4/23/19, 12:10 AM - Divya Cs: <Media omitted>
4/23/19, 12:10 AM - Divya Cs: ^i think that's how you do it
4/23/19, 12:14 AM - Jenit Jain: Yep cool
4/23/19, 11:40 AM - Jenit Jain: Send me any capital recovery sum which has recurring and non recurring calculations
4/23/19, 11:50 AM - Divya Cs: Capitalized cost you mean?
4/23/19, 11:51 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes yes sorry

4/24/19, 4:14 PM - Jenit Jain: If 2 non terminals that's are not starting symbols are in deadlock while finding the follow set then we just add $ to both of them right?
4/24/19, 4:15 PM - Jenit Jain: X -> YZ
Y-> a| epsilon
Z -> b
4/24/19, 4:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Will first(X) contain epsilong
4/25/19, 2:44 AM - Divya Cs: Nope
4/25/19, 2:44 AM - Divya Cs: First(X) ={a,b}
4/25/19, 2:45 AM - Divya Cs: Add dollar to one of them to break out of the loop and then continue as you would normally
4/25/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: only one?
4/25/19, 8:23 AM - Jenit Jain: and which chapter do we have from flex oreilly
4/25/19, 9:30 AM - Divya Cs: The first 3 I think
4/25/19, 9:39 AM - Jenit Jain: Fuck
4/25/19, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Do you understand the instruction count part
4/25/19, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: The associated cost
4/25/19, 12:33 PM - Divya Cs: Count the no. Of memory accesses
4/25/19, 12:34 PM - Divya Cs: Add one for each memory access
4/25/19, 12:34 PM - Jenit Jain: And one for storing too right
4/25/19, 12:35 PM - Divya Cs: Ya store is 1 I think

4/26/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: In cuda arrays are stored in local memory right
4/26/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Which is unique for every thread
4/26/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Where is this local memory? It's not shown in the diagram
4/26/19, 9:26 PM - Divya Cs: Reg and shared memory are local
4/26/19, 9:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha it's stored in global only I checked
4/26/19, 9:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Also
4/26/19, 9:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you pvm
4/26/19, 9:37 PM - Divya Cs: Sort of

4/29/19, 3:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Are you reading everything
4/29/19, 3:54 PM - Jenit Jain: And are your notes enough for that chapter
4/29/19, 4:03 PM - Divya Cs: It's only .1 .2 .5 .6
4/29/19, 4:03 PM - Divya Cs: I don't think my notes are even there for that chapter
4/29/19, 4:03 PM - Divya Cs: Slides possible
4/29/19, 4:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Wowwwww
4/29/19, 4:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Just spent hours doing .3 .4
4/29/19, 4:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks ks

4/29/19, 4:17 PM - Divya Cs: Ayyyy ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
4/29/19, 4:58 PM - Jenit Jain: stuff is basically a part of something and retains the same intrinsic properties even when subdivided. Right? and what about Things
4/29/19, 5:33 PM - Divya Cs: Which chapter is stuff and things? üôàüôà
4/29/19, 5:33 PM - Jenit Jain: 12
4/29/19, 5:35 PM - Divya Cs: I can't find iiit
4/29/19, 5:35 PM - Divya Cs: Deth
4/29/19, 5:36 PM - Jenit Jain: 12.2.3
4/29/19, 5:39 PM - Divya Cs: Okay ya so stuff basically can be subdivided infinitely and still retains the same properties as the whole so you can't identify individuals
4/29/19, 5:39 PM - Divya Cs: And things are basically anything you can describe with count nouns
4/29/19, 5:40 PM - Divya Cs: Stuff you can't divide into distinct objects 
Things you can
4/29/19, 5:40 PM - Divya Cs: Things are countable and dividing it doesn't give you 2 of the thing
4/29/19, 5:41 PM - Divya Cs: Any part of "stuff" is also stuff
4/29/19, 5:45 PM - Jenit Jain: give examples of things
4/29/19, 5:45 PM - Jenit Jain: stuff i understoof
4/29/19, 5:48 PM - Divya Cs: Aardvark?
4/29/19, 5:48 PM - Divya Cs: Books
4/29/19, 5:48 PM - Divya Cs: Anything you can count
4/29/19, 5:48 PM - Jenit Jain: accha okay thanksss
4/29/19, 5:48 PM - Divya Cs: üôÉ
4/29/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: dude whats the difference between graph and tree search
4/29/19, 6:14 PM - Jenit Jain: in a tree search it traversing can get stuck in a loop but in graph search we use explored states ka set so it doesnt go in that infinite loop?
4/29/19, 6:14 PM - Divya Cs: Yup
4/29/19, 6:14 PM - Divya Cs: That
4/29/19, 6:14 PM - Jenit Jain: cool thankss
4/29/19, 6:15 PM - Divya Cs: Tree only has frontier 
Graph has frontier and explored
4/29/19, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: shit man should have studied yesterday
4/29/19, 6:15 PM - Divya Cs: ++ to that
4/29/19, 6:17 PM - Jenit Jain: on A* after reaching a goal state do we check if other goal states can be reached in lesser distance?
4/29/19, 6:17 PM - Jenit Jain: or once if we get the answer thenn thats that
4/29/19, 6:19 PM - Divya Cs: I think you look to see if there are more optimal ways
4/29/19, 6:20 PM - Divya Cs: Cuz I remember reading that it might expand a few nodes on the goal contour
4/29/19, 6:20 PM - Divya Cs: Before deciding the final solution
4/29/19, 6:20 PM - Divya Cs: But I think practically it should be fine if you stop at the first solution
4/29/19, 6:23 PM - Jenit Jain: What do you mean on goal contours
4/29/19, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: bro isnt the dfs just S A G1
4/29/19, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/29/19, 6:30 PM - Jenit Jain: this is the solution i have but its wrong right?
4/29/19, 6:40 PM - Divya Cs: This is wrong
4/29/19, 6:40 PM - Divya Cs: I think they've switched DFS and bfs
4/29/19, 6:47 PM - Jenit Jain: It's not even for that lol
4/29/19, 6:47 PM - Jenit Jain: .
4/29/19, 6:47 PM - Divya Cs: Ya DFS is definitely S A G1
4/29/19, 6:48 PM - Jenit Jain: See from your notes I'm doing full propositional logic and Fol
4/29/19, 6:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Should I do chapter 8 from the text
4/29/19, 6:48 PM - Divya Cs: Should be enough
4/29/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Great

4/29/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: This js fol only
4/29/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Knowledge engineering
4/29/19, 6:49 PM - Divya Cs: 8 is FOL
4/29/19, 6:49 PM - Divya Cs: That they'll mostly ask only questions not too much theory anyway
4/29/19, 6:50 PM - Jenit Jain: So this?
4/29/19, 6:50 PM - Divya Cs: Yup
4/30/19, 8:20 AM - Jenit Jain: In the water jug problem, you just try to get the answer through intuition through the graph right
4/30/19, 5:10 PM - Jenit Jain: How was it üôàüôàüôà
4/30/19, 5:12 PM - Divya Cs: It wasn't so bad
