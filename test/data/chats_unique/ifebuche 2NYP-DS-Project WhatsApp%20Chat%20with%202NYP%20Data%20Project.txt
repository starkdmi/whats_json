10/23/20, 3:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Should.

Just to be sure, pull up a command prompt and type:
_python_

Hit enter.
If it loads a python prompt (ending with '>>>'), you good to go.

You can also do:
_python - - version_

Make sure you have at least version 3.6.

We can all check this and make sure we good to go.

Like I said, what needs done is fire up a python script that streams tweets with a topic in real time.

10/24/20, 7:00 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good question.

So, for each group, you are expected to stream for at least 30 minutes or as much as you are able to within those two times.

Good morning.
10/25/20, 11:07 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I hope we are all eagerly awaiting kick off.
Some information:
10/25/20, 11:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will have a quick 15-25 minutes meeting later in the evening where I will a few things:
- How to grab your credentials on the Twitter Developer Account page.
- How to prepare your python environment for streaming tweets.
- How to run the main script and how to restart it if need be. (We might throw in a function to send a mail if it fails or wen it reaches our desired duration. _MIGHT_ )
- How to run the cleanup script to strip down the tweets written to file and possibly dispatch them via WeTransfer for warehousing on my end.
- Modus operandi for our _Trend Setter(s)_
- AOB.

Don't worry, some of the items will take only a couple minutes.
It is going to be a fast paced meeting so we don not waster anybody's precious weekend time.

Cheers.

PS: If there are any other issue(s) I am missing or anyone would want me address, please let me know.

By the way, for the duration of the project, you get 100% access to asking me any data analytics, python, django, drf, pandas questions you might have. If they are specific enough I will answer them very fast. If they require writing an essay I will probably run away.

Meeting time 8pm. Link will be shared soon.
Rgds!

10/25/20, 11:40 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. Appears you joined a bit later.

Answer all questions and where applicable cite educational purposes as reason for requiring access. Then indicate you *WILL NOT* share data from Twitter outside of Twitter. We are not going to be doing that. At least not directly.
10/25/20, 11:40 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: If we can get a sample to tweak as per how do you plan
10/25/20, 11:41 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Just follow these pointers and you will be fine.

Indicate you are participating in a freelance educational data science project (researching on topics around protests in Nigeria), provide the name and the facilitator's name if you like.

- Analysis will involve natural language processing to find key issues. 

For the rest of the questions, your app will NOT be tweeting, retweeting, following etc. Your app will NOT display tweets outside of Twitter.

Maybe it might just be cos it was dormant. You can explore options around reactivating it but if it appears long just apply for a fresh one.

Will try and recap soon.
10/25/20, 11:36 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: Well, Paschal gave us a run down on how we can go about listening in to twitter to retrieve tweets on any trending hash tag and then converting the retrieved tweets (which will by default be in json format) to MS Excel. 

Of course, all these can only be possible when one possesses a twitter developer account, and has python installed in his computer.
10/26/20, 8:07 AM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: Thanks for the summary. What do you mean by listening to twitter?
10/26/20, 8:18 AM - Adafin: To us Listening this morning. Keywords: fashola, #ENDSARS
10/26/20, 8:25 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Succinct ‚úåÔ∏è
10/26/20, 8:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is done with a python script. It connects to the Twitter streaming API endpoint and waits for the mentioned of keywords/topic one put in.
10/26/20, 8:29 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Morning boss
10/26/20, 8:29 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Can we get a video of the exercise we did yesterday

10/26/20, 8:31 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Probably.
10/26/20, 8:31 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A short video maybe.
10/26/20, 8:31 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Thanks boss
10/26/20, 8:31 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Later in the day.
10/26/20, 8:38 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good morning all. 

A quick summary of what went down at yesterday's meeting.

Apart from the demonstration of preparing the environment and streaming tweets, we heard that :

- We will begin official streaming on Wednesday to allow a few still in the process of getting their dev account approved to be ready .

- We will have topics to stream daily on the roaster. So we are enjoined to check them periodically to see what each is streaming.

- Stream for 30 minutes or get 200-250MB of data. Any one that comes first is ok and we are free to do much more.

- By now if you are not on the team roaster, we are at a loss where you are. üòÅ


In the guidance video I'll send later, I'll include sending the _meated_ data to me for warehousing and eventual analysis. 

Best of the new week.

10/26/20, 2:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's about the most interesting column after text. A lot of info there. üòÅ
10/26/20, 2:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm happy we are exploring it.
10/26/20, 2:55 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Yeah
10/26/20, 2:55 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: So we'll be done some text analysis right?
10/26/20, 2:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A lot. Checkout NLP. 

At this stage, we will concern ourselves with gathering the data. Cleaning and analysis will be much later.
10/26/20, 2:57 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Okay. I'm yet to dive into NLP.
10/26/20, 2:58 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Cool...

But just to be sure, we are starting officially by Wednesday right?
10/26/20, 2:58 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Yes we are
10/26/20, 2:58 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Just playing around with it to see what I can get

10/26/20, 4:53 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: You ll get an email
10/26/20, 4:54 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Go to Developer.twitter.com/en/app and try logging in or creating an app...

It would show boldy if it's still in review, or rejected.

10/27/20, 4:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You don't have the python model _tweepy_ installed. Missed that part in the _getting started video_
10/27/20, 4:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In that same command prompt type:

_pip install tweepy pandas_
10/27/20, 4:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Then hit enter.

Copy that line in italics starting with pip to make sure there's no mistake. Paste it in the copy prompt and hit enter.
10/27/20, 4:18 PM - +234 905 870 2551: It's installing, thanks

You getting hang of it now.
10/27/20, 4:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's needed for converting a dataframe to excel. I'm surprised pandas didn't bring it with it as a dependency. But it's all good. Install it too.
10/27/20, 4:28 PM - +234 905 870 2551: so pip install openpyxl pandas right?
10/27/20, 4:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Na.

_pip install openpyxl_
10/27/20, 4:28 PM - +234 905 870 2551: okay
10/27/20, 4:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I put pandas before so you install it too just in case it wasn't there.

To install more than one module in succession just give a space and keep writing their name(s)

10/27/20, 4:41 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sure.
They have a Developer community too.

Getting approved is more complicated. At least that was my initial experience with them. Maybe if I get back I'll do better. But Facebook doesn't hold the same interest Twitter holds for me.
10/27/20, 4:42 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Lol
10/27/20, 4:42 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: I need to sit down with that script and learn it line for line word for word
10/27/20, 4:43 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: I'll advise you also go through twitter documentation.
10/27/20, 5:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Right.

If you wanna use tweepy, I recommend going through its documentation. If Twython is what you prefer, their doc is where to be also.
10/27/20, 5:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In readiness for tomorrow, our trend setters should grab for us the top trends for Lagos and Abuja.

@2347068609792 be on Lagos and @2348134565325 be on Abuja.

Working out an order to deliver them.

10/27/20, 5:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hm.

Unless you have a specific need for 3.9 you might wanna uninstall and reinstall python getting something lower than 3.9
10/27/20, 5:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: But first try this
10/27/20, 5:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _python -m pip install --upgrade pip_

10/27/20, 5:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: After this, retry installing the modules. If you get same error, uninstall and install 3.7 or 3.8

It was part of the conditions to sign up. Those who don't have a PC to work with directly let me know and I figured they could help us with something else if they were eager to tag along.

10/27/20, 6:01 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I used version 3.9 and my tweepy installed fine.
10/27/20, 6:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I wonder.
pip might be too old or there is a conflict somewhere.

The error references a 3.8. Something is mixed up. Let's see if upgrading pip does it, otherwise a reinstallation is the best bet.
10/27/20, 6:24 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Probably...

The script will handle all movements and organizing the folders. All you need do is run it.

If possible you can even use Windows scheduler to schedule it to run and once your computer is on, you don't even need to start te script.

10/27/20, 10:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 200-250 or 30 minutes of streaming whichever comes first.

You can always do more than that if you feel like and are able to.
10/27/20, 10:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I mean minimum of 200-250MB

10/27/20, 11:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: With this one, you don't have to move files to avoid to avoid overwriting them. The script will figure out if a previous file is there and merge them.

For eg:
You run it one day one and it creates Endsars.xlsx

On day two, if same topic was run, it won't overwrite this file but rather read it and add the one for day two to it making it one file.

If day it is a different name/topic, it will just write a fresh excel file.
10/27/20, 11:18 PM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: But there's also the part of saying Json_file folder already exist 
Are we meant to just delete the one from the day before?
10/27/20, 11:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. Nope.
This time, it moves the json file to the folder appending a datetime tag to the name. Even if run 10 times in an hour it will turn up with a different name.
10/27/20, 11:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, both old and new ones will stay with their name ending varying.

10/28/20, 8:22 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It is very relative to keywords. 

A topic is hot/fast if the script is writing around 1MB per minute.

10/28/20, 8:31 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I can see you are.

Ok.
Open the script with an editor (code or notepad), get to line 39 or search for _chunksize_. Change the value from 20k to 10k. If it fails again, change it to 5k. 

As you go smaller, the script will take a bit longer and do more chunks to finish the load. I anticipated this that's why I used chunking in the second script.

Primary issue is a low memory power on the PC. in case you are wondering.

10/28/20, 9:31 AM - +234 909 139 0809: Can someone please keep me updated
10/28/20, 9:39 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To accommodate the possible bug with the introduction of _nrows_ from pandas v1.1.2, I have updated the script to try and recover from a possible memory error. The updated script: üëá

10/28/20, 10:47 AM - Adafin: <Media omitted>
10/28/20, 10:47 AM - Adafin: Got this trying to run the nearing script
10/28/20, 10:49 AM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: You need to type python first
10/28/20, 10:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/28/20, 11:05 AM - Adafin: Oh thanks
10/28/20, 11:07 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello Guys:
Twitter changed some paraments in their Stream payload. The meating script will be failing for new streams saved. 
Updating the script to respond to catchup with that change.
10/28/20, 11:08 AM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Thanks for the heads up boss
10/28/20, 11:09 AM - Adafin: Mine worked... 11am session. Day 1 done. Captured from 8am - 11am 130MB
10/28/20, 11:14 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good job.

It will start failing soon.
10/28/20, 11:33 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
10/28/20, 11:34 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Updated version with bug fixes and response to Twitter API streaming endpoint.
10/28/20, 11:38 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: should we use this now
10/28/20, 11:42 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes.

Please let us start using the version two of the _meating_ script named _meating_v2.py_ as the other one will start failing soon.
10/28/20, 11:43 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: boss i observed that the streaming is slow any reason for that
10/28/20, 11:44 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's just the topic. Not a lot of tweets about it at the time.

Once your spelling of the topic is right, you are good.
10/28/20, 11:48 AM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: For those handicapped with data, how do we get data grant
10/28/20, 11:48 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: PM me.
10/28/20, 11:52 AM - +234 703 385 3682: Okay, got it
10/28/20, 11:59 AM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: Is the spelling case sensitive?
10/28/20, 11:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Shouldn't be.
But observe it still.
10/28/20, 12:01 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: Alright Boss
10/28/20, 12:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Let's remember to always check the roster for updates to our various topics.

I will add it to the group description for easy access
10/28/20, 12:13 PM - You changed the group description
10/28/20, 12:25 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Twitter Trends aren't case sensitive...

Just the same way # on social media (anyone) the isn't case sensitive.
10/28/20, 12:28 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: @2348167759946
@2349081987335

Yea, I agree #endinjustice is hardly trending.
Pardon me, I am quite active on twitter.
10/28/20, 12:28 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: It is so slow
10/28/20, 12:30 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Right now, people are responding to Sanwoolu, since the Army said he was the one that invited them.

I guess Lekki Massacre will still be streaming a lot.
10/28/20, 12:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üëçüëç
Please everyone bring on their experiences. We are team alright.

Any suggestions for alternatives?

Our trend setters, I have not got any trends so far o.
10/28/20, 12:30 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: üòÖ

Thank you for your patience with it
10/28/20, 12:31 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Sanwoolu, should do better right now for Lagos.
10/28/20, 12:31 PM - +234 901 554 6925: On point
10/28/20, 12:34 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Let the team on endinjustuce *only* switch to Sanwo Olu
10/28/20, 12:34 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Use _Sanwo_ only
10/28/20, 12:35 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Who gave the orders

Too was trending this morning, right now it's on number 8
10/28/20, 12:36 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Right.

Just found that
10/28/20, 12:36 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Yes, this is better...
üëåüèæ
10/28/20, 12:36 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lemme screenshot the present topics
10/28/20, 12:36 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: #Sanwo
10/28/20, 12:36 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I think you should just use Sanwo

No #
10/28/20, 12:37 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Okay
10/28/20, 12:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
10/28/20, 12:39 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Should I change my own to sanwo and stream again
10/28/20, 12:39 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: üí™üèæ

Well done sir
10/28/20, 12:40 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: This shows how important the Trend Setters role is...
ü§î
10/28/20, 12:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Exactly. üíØ
10/28/20, 12:43 PM - Adafin: I think it's EndbadagorvernanceinNigeria
10/28/20, 12:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Governance is it now but government was hot before.

Listeners on that can run two scripts at a time for them differently.
10/28/20, 12:48 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Nice one üëåüèæ
10/28/20, 12:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, *officially*:

Anyone can run a max of 3 of the nyp_stream at a time. I think that's what twitter allows so far. A 4th one will be unresponsive unless they have changed something.

Feel free to run add any two more topics you believe that are relevant to the project. The meating script will be aware and treat them accordingly.

Please don't choose a topic outside our scope like _Abati_ and his _erection industry_  üò∂ or Tottenham or Real Madrid.
10/28/20, 12:49 PM - Adafin: Ok
10/28/20, 12:49 PM - Adafin: Lol
10/28/20, 12:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Don't do a topic assigned to someone already though. To minimize duplicates. But we are able to deal with duplicates eventually.
10/28/20, 1:03 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: üòÇ

That Ghanaian Police thing...

Point taken sir.
10/28/20, 1:11 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Am streaming two concurrently
10/28/20, 1:12 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Endinjustice and sanwo
10/28/20, 1:16 PM - +234 905 870 2551: I just started streaming Sanwo, it's quite slow. So I'll stream for 30mins or get abt 250mb yeah?
10/28/20, 1:16 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Also, when do I run the meating.py script? Is it after the 30mins?
10/28/20, 1:23 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Once you are done streaming, running the meating.py script to reduce the size
10/28/20, 1:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Stop the script and

_DID YOU GIVE THE ORDERS_

Or start another instance of the script by opening another cmd prompt from the folder and running it too.
10/28/20, 1:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ

After you have stopped all your scripts in case you are running more than one topic.
10/28/20, 1:41 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: @2349081987335 Mine hardly streams for more than 3mb before it would just freeze on me. I'd have to start another instance of cmd prompt for it to continue from where it stopped.
10/28/20, 1:41 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: What could be the possible cause of this?
10/28/20, 1:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ü§î
10/28/20, 1:48 PM - +234 905 870 2551: I should stream did you give the orders too?
10/28/20, 1:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If it continues, refresh your Twitter developer keys and update them in the script.
10/28/20, 1:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes.
They can run at the same time.

Open another command prompt from that folder and start a fresh instance of the script, then type in the new topic. Don't put a question mark.
10/28/20, 1:49 PM - +234 905 870 2551: In caps right?
10/28/20, 1:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Caps or Low will work
10/28/20, 1:52 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Got it
10/28/20, 2:11 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: It must have been network issues. It's moving now.
10/28/20, 2:29 PM - +234 905 870 2551: What email are we sending it to?
10/28/20, 2:30 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Or we're going to send everything at once after the whole thing
10/28/20, 2:42 PM - +234 901 554 6925: netbraus@gmail.com

It's the Excel we need to send.

Great job. üëç

10/28/20, 4:03 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: We send the JSON?
10/28/20, 4:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Nope.
10/28/20, 4:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We are expected to send the Excel.
10/28/20, 4:04 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Done
10/28/20, 4:04 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: It's the meating.py that gets the excel rhy?
10/28/20, 4:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yup.
10/28/20, 4:05 PM - +234 901 554 6925: Yes.. And also reduce the size of the json
10/28/20, 4:05 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Alright thanks
10/28/20, 5:08 PM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: #LekkiMassacre seems have slowed down. Just 55mb after 40 minutes
10/28/20, 5:09 PM - Adafin: This message was deleted
10/28/20, 5:09 PM - Adafin: Thanks
10/28/20, 5:32 PM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: Is the data size to be imputed that of Json or Excel?
10/28/20, 5:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Json
10/28/20, 7:39 PM - Richie AskPyFesh joined using this group's invite link
10/28/20, 7:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello Trend setters.

There's no movement from your end. Not even one.

Are we there?
10/28/20, 7:49 PM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: Thanks
10/28/20, 7:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Announcement*
Will share a public github repo we will have our resources especially scripts.
10/28/20, 7:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Once it's ready I'll share the link here.
10/28/20, 7:52 PM - Uduak Ekere 2NYP: Hello I dropped a msg earlier that when do we submit trends..I didn't get a reply
10/28/20, 7:52 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Problem for people like us that don't know how to use Github ü§£
10/28/20, 7:54 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: And github is quite straight forward tho.
Just open an account and try navigating.

You can check youtube, in 15mins, you will be a master üòèüòè
10/28/20, 7:55 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Please, updated google sheet.
10/28/20, 7:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
ü§î

Might be a good opportunity to learn how it works.

But to make sure we don't overburden us, I'll have a Google drive shared folder to hold them too and try to update both.

If time permits I'll make a quick video on how to use github to get resources.
10/28/20, 7:57 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Thanks ü§ó
10/28/20, 7:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: On sending files to me, if you prefer sending it via email like some have done, please so.

In due time I'll update the meating script to also dispatch a mail with the excel file attached.
10/28/20, 7:58 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: I have an account
Been trying to learn how to do all the pull and etc with code
Instead of going to the site and doing it manually
10/28/20, 7:58 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Correct
10/28/20, 8:02 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Ohh... Pardon me then
10/28/20, 8:02 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Boss are we sending you the excel file or JSON file
10/28/20, 8:02 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Just the Excel file sir..
10/28/20, 8:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/28/20, 8:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Permit me to note that in a week, I'll do a review and all who are not contributing we will disembark them so we don't keep disturbing them with all our periodic chatter.*

For any issues please don't hesitate to let me know.

10/28/20, 8:18 PM - +234 905 870 2551: I'm not sure I understand this. Who are the trendsetters?
10/28/20, 8:20 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Github will be nice o, for future uses too. Personally I prefer it.

Those that don't know how to use it can use this opportunity to learn or just send to the drive like you proposed
10/28/20, 8:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Don't worry.
They know themselves.
10/28/20, 8:21 PM - +234 905 870 2551: See me I want to learn the whole script thing o, you're doing a great job.
10/28/20, 8:21 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Oh okay
10/28/20, 9:39 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: #LekkiTollGateShooting is really slow tonight.
10/28/20, 9:42 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Even #EndSARS isn't streaming like I expected.
10/28/20, 9:43 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I think it paused when the streaming got to 604MB, I just restarted it and it's going.
10/28/20, 10:06 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Mine is just 18 mb, it over  an hour now

10/28/20, 11:00 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: This is there too... But #OyingboMassacre was really trending in Lagos,
about 8k tweets.
10/28/20, 11:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ü§£

10/28/20, 11:06 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I was able to get 14MB from #EndSARS after meating.

2NYP Day 1... a success.
10/28/20, 11:06 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: #endinjustice
10/28/20, 11:07 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Yea, we had issues with this # earlier today...

10/28/20, 11:09 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Wat can we do
10/28/20, 11:09 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Cos it very very slow
10/28/20, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The champions league will slow things down. It's all over the place.
10/28/20, 11:10 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I was about saying this too...
10/28/20, 11:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, traffic will eventually pick up from moro
10/28/20, 11:12 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: @2348102988078 Did you try this #?
10/28/20, 11:12 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: should we hold on till tomorrow?
10/28/20, 11:12 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Yes sir...

10/28/20, 11:16 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Sorry about that @2348160029671 

It could be that there's no tweet on it at the moment too tho.
Or it's really really low.
10/28/20, 11:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/28/20, 11:17 PM - Khalid Yusuf Liman 2NYP: Yeah
10/28/20, 11:17 PM - Khalid Yusuf Liman 2NYP: Tried another key #EndSWAT and it's streaming though it's too slow
10/28/20, 11:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you would wanna test if it's your network, try _Rashford_ and see.

But delete it or take to somewhere else so you don't mix it up.
10/28/20, 11:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üëç
But if that's not your original topic you don't need to continue with it.
10/28/20, 11:19 PM - Khalid Yusuf Liman 2NYP: That's not my original topic
10/28/20, 11:19 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: @2349081987335 boss this might be forward but I wanted to ask. When it comes to analysis will we only be looking at what people are saying in Lagos and Abuja... 
Just because I was thinking comparing sentiments of Nigerians across all 4zones will be pretty cool
10/28/20, 11:19 PM - Khalid Yusuf Liman 2NYP: Just testing
10/28/20, 11:20 PM - Khalid Yusuf Liman 2NYP: ' Who ordered the lekki killings? That's my topic but it's not streaming at all
10/28/20, 11:21 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Yes
10/28/20, 11:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Na.
Worldwide. But we know it's Nigeria and Nigerians that will provide the bulk of the traffic.

Looking at Lagos or Abuja or Rivers traffic is just to peep a view what is hot and be guided. Other parts of Naija sure will be talking in that topic too.
10/28/20, 11:21 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Try to remove the question mark. I streamed it in the afternoon, not fast but I got something
10/28/20, 11:21 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Yes
10/28/20, 11:22 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Ahh sweet! Makes sense
10/28/20, 11:26 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: It there a maximum number of streaming one can do at a time
10/28/20, 11:26 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Currently running two, trying a third on but it's not going
10/28/20, 11:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 3. From experience. The 4th concurrent one never gets to stream. I think Twitter structured it that one. Each stream bears your keys so they know when yo throttle you.
10/28/20, 11:27 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: But just on my third
10/28/20, 11:28 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Will creating new keys work
10/28/20, 11:29 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: That will make your current keys invalid
10/28/20, 11:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kills the old one.

This is someone's endpoint. They hold the key and are infinitely able to dictate what you can do, lol.
10/28/20, 11:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/28/20, 11:29 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Maybe try creating a new app
10/28/20, 11:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Nice. Haven't tried this.

But I have more than one twitter dev account.
10/28/20, 11:30 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Oh.. alright
10/28/20, 11:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I feel it might still boil down back to the same user and hit same limits. But it's worth trying first. Don't have the facts on it.
10/28/20, 11:30 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Sweet...

Sir, do you know if Twitter allows you reapply for a Dev account if Denied before?
10/28/20, 11:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of course.
10/28/20, 11:31 PM - Khalid Yusuf Liman 2NYP: Who ordered lekki killings is streaming now but though it's slow
10/28/20, 11:31 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Are we to end all scripts before the end of the day or can we run a script to the next i
10/28/20, 11:32 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Day*
10/28/20, 11:32 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Should end today. But if you feel no one will be on the topic in the few hours into the next period, you can continue.
10/28/20, 11:36 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Okay. So will it count as today's file or tomorrow's
10/28/20, 11:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Doesn't really matter. Just needs to get into the bag. The effort of segmenting is about covering varying times of the day and reducing duplicates.
10/28/20, 11:37 PM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: üëå
10/29/20, 1:21 AM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: I will continue on this alongside #EndSWAT as the latter
10/29/20, 1:23 AM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: This is #OyigboMassacre
10/29/20, 6:08 AM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Ohh... Thanks for the correction Oluwatobi üòä
10/29/20, 10:48 AM - +234 703 385 3682: My bad, I didn't stream ystd at Dusk, so I'm streaming now to cover up for the lag
10/29/20, 11:15 AM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: I used #OyingboMassacre ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/29/20, 11:17 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: What is trending this morning
10/29/20, 11:18 AM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Couldn't get a tangible MB from the streaming
10/29/20, 11:19 AM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: How was it??
10/29/20, 11:21 AM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Didn't get much
10/29/20, 11:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No matter how little you collect it is still ok.
The numbers are still going to be indicative of what is happening. One interpretation could be tapering interest in the issues we are tracking which is still indicative. So, it's all good still.

Those on #EndSARS should know they are the flagbearers of the show. We need steady monitoring of that topic. Should anyone on it on any of the teams be unable to stream, they *need* to let us know.
10/29/20, 11:27 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
10/29/20, 11:28 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Updated _meating_ script to fix a minor issue with meating while there is an old file of same topic in the folder.
10/29/20, 11:28 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The above issue brings me to make a point:

Feel free to stream several times during your team's times slot if you are able to.
10/29/20, 11:29 AM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Noted boss! Thanks for this
10/29/20, 11:43 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The Github repo:
https://github.com/ifebuche/2NYP-DS-Project
READ.me to be updated later.

Google Drive shared folder coming soon too.
10/29/20, 11:45 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Boss the streaming is somehow oh
10/29/20, 11:45 AM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Correct ooo
10/29/20, 11:47 AM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Please can you teach us during the weekend how to use code to perform different Github actions üôè
10/29/20, 11:48 AM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Great... Will the github be in the Drive folder sir?
10/29/20, 11:48 AM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Github video tutorial*
10/29/20, 12:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Eventually yea.
10/29/20, 12:47 PM - +234 905 870 2551: So we're using this now? What if there I had no error running the one you sent yesterday afternoon?
10/29/20, 12:50 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Have you tried to run the meating.py doc twice already? 

The error will only come when you try to run the meating.py script after it has already created the excel file first time round
10/29/20, 12:50 PM - +234 905 870 2551: So instead of using weshare to transfer the excel files, we upload instead to github yea?
10/29/20, 12:51 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Uhmmm, I've not had any reason to run it twice. What am I doing wrong o
10/29/20, 12:52 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Lol you are not doing anything wrong ooh! I meant if you‚Äôve run the script today after yesterday
10/29/20, 12:57 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Oh, okay

I'm about to stream for today. So I can't use the same meating file right?
10/29/20, 12:57 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Also, I streamed Sanwo yesterday, am I doing same today?
10/29/20, 1:24 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: Yes, so you can either download the most recent meating_v2 that Pascal uploaded! Or use the current meating.py you already have, you‚Äôll just have to rename the excel file you generated yesterday!
10/29/20, 1:25 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: This I‚Äôm not sure of! I‚Äôd advise that you refer to the google sheet @2349081987335 created for us. There you‚Äôll find the keywords that assigned to you for today
10/29/20, 1:27 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Pls send the link, the Google sheet I checked has nothing on it
10/29/20, 1:27 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: This is the link to the sheet.
10/29/20, 1:28 PM - +234 905 870 2551: I actually opened a new folder for today's streams. Am I supposed to use the same folder as yesterday
10/29/20, 1:28 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: That would work aswell
10/29/20, 1:28 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Okay. Thanks
10/29/20, 1:29 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: <Media omitted>
10/29/20, 1:29 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: üëåüèæ
10/29/20, 1:33 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Still the same then. Thank you Daniel/IyiolaüòÑ
10/29/20, 1:35 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: You are welcome ma'am üòä
10/29/20, 1:35 PM - +234 905 870 2551: The streaming is slow sha for both keywords, that is 'Sanwo' and 'Did you give the orders'
10/29/20, 1:38 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Well, on the issue of #EndSARS...

Adeshina and Desmond Eliot were the ones kinda trending earlier today.
10/29/20, 1:38 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Adeshina was on Channels talking about the looting.
10/29/20, 1:38 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: The whole thing is seeming to die down a bit.
10/29/20, 1:38 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: You welcome üí™üèæüí™üèæ
10/29/20, 1:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Na.
That's an option but it will burden all who have access to the repo with data consumption. So better got everyone to send to me individually so I bear the _brunt_ alone.
10/29/20, 1:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Some General Guidance*

The topics we have so far will be our topics up to end of Friday. It _could_ change from Saturday.

With the very latest version of _meating_ sent in here (same as in the repo), *you do not need to rename or move any file*. The script will keep doing it for you.

After meating, no json file remains in your main folder, only Excel to be sent out.

I will simplify further to be (if you give it your email login credentials) that the script picks up the excel, sends it to me and puts it in another folder. That was after each meating no or json file remains in the main folder.
10/29/20, 2:11 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
10/29/20, 2:13 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: So I see that after the meating process, the previous day's Excel file is updated with the current day's data. 
Wouldn't it be better for us to send the complete Excel file to you at once on the last day we are streaming a topic, instead of sending you each day's update?
10/29/20, 2:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's an important observation.
10/29/20, 2:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Didn't anticipate this scenario. I'll come up with a solution update before the end of the day.

Meanwhile let's keep doing what we are doing so far.
10/29/20, 2:22 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: No qualms boss
10/29/20, 2:36 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Also @2349081987335 I missed the zoom call earlier this week so I'm sure you must have done this. 

When you're less busy, can you like give a rundown of the whole process, like what we're doing after gathering the data and what not? Having the full picture in mind will be helpful
10/29/20, 2:48 PM - Amir Adeoye Arasheed 2NYP: Oh
10/29/20, 2:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You deleted this message
10/29/20, 2:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll find time to organize another meeting to speak to some issues. That'd be after a week of data gathering. This will help us also to audit who is working with us and who is not.

At the end of the weekend, I will post an analysis of activities in here. I'll share the script for whoever might wanna reuse aspects of it.
10/29/20, 2:54 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: <Media omitted>
10/29/20, 3:33 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: I think Desmond Elliot is trending
10/29/20, 3:33 PM - +234 901 554 6925: Desmond Idiot you mean??ü§™ü§™
10/29/20, 3:34 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Yes oh

10/29/20, 8:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello guys.
We have a mailer
10/29/20, 8:14 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Ohkay sir?
10/29/20, 8:33 PM - Uduak Ekere 2NYP: Hello dusk team,in addition to your allotted topic you can also stream this too..#BETTERNIGERIA
10/29/20, 8:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Mailer Script Guidelines*
The mail script which I will share in a minute has the following prerequisites:

- This first version will only work with GMAIL
- You will need to enable _Less Secure Apps_ from settings or have an app password to use it.

To enable less secure apps in gmail do the following:
- Go to https://myaccount.google.com/ and login if prompted.
- Click on the _Security_ tab
-  Click _Less Secure App Access_ and turn on _Allow less secure apps_
10/29/20, 8:41 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
Thanks _trendsetter_. The only active one so far. üëç
10/29/20, 8:44 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Please this meating v2
Does it over write the excel file there
10/29/20, 8:44 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Or it adds to it
10/29/20, 8:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Adds to it
10/29/20, 8:45 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Thanks
10/29/20, 8:46 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Because it became smaller than yesterday's own
10/29/20, 8:46 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Yesterday excel was 2.6mb
Today's own is 2.5mb
10/29/20, 8:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok.
It actually got a bit smarter at meating in the latest version allowing much smaller size.
10/29/20, 8:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Same topic?
10/29/20, 8:48 PM - Jude Onyekaba 2NYP: Alright
10/29/20, 9:03 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: Ok i will do this ASAP

10/29/20, 9:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The mailer script will create a folder called _Sent_Files_ 

It will pick up all Excel files in the folder, send them to me and then move them to the _Sent_Folder_

10/29/20, 11:16 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: for those of us that the size of our streaming was not up to mb , how are we going to go about it @2349081987335
10/30/20, 2:49 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You can send it over still.
10/30/20, 2:53 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Due to its behavior, we can keep using the meating script until the corresponding Excel file gets to around 10MB  or our assigned topic changes before using the mailer.
10/30/20, 4:07 AM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I noticed an error in during my meating yesterday.
Until I moved my pervious Excel file out of the directory, my new json file didn't meat.

So, I have two different files for 28th and 29th...
10/30/20, 4:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You were probably not using the most up to date version. But it's ok to send both.
10/30/20, 4:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lemme know if that behavior continues
10/30/20, 4:15 AM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Ohkay sir... I was using the first meating_v2
10/30/20, 4:15 AM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Thank you, I will get the latest one.
10/30/20, 4:15 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Aight.
10/30/20, 5:30 AM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: #lekkimassacre seems slow atm. Will probably pick up later this morning
10/30/20, 9:04 AM - Adafin: @fesh... I haven't sent my morning and dusk file for yesterday. Have it on my system. Will send everything along on sunday.
10/30/20, 9:15 AM - Adafin: Streaming is slow this morning
10/30/20, 9:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Noted.
10/30/20, 9:18 AM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Experienced same
10/30/20, 9:18 AM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: I'm also using this version
10/30/20, 9:21 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The meating script v2 has two updates already.

I want us to grab the very latest from the github repo or the Google drive folder.

They have same name so one might think they have the correct one.

However please let me know if we still notice the same error.
10/30/20, 9:21 AM - Justus Ilemobayo 2NYP: Alright sir
10/30/20, 10:24 AM - +234 703 385 3682: I nod
10/30/20, 10:37 AM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: For the sake of test run, will the mailer script work if we replace your email address with ours?.. just to see how it works
10/30/20, 10:38 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hehe.

Yes.
The person you put their email there will get the mail.
10/30/20, 10:40 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are looking at reusing the script for some other purpose, one thing you could do is ask for user input for the email to send to. That way it will serve a lot of different instances. Perhaps load a list of emails to send to and send the mail in a loop. This is exactly how I sent all of you the emails I did, a script.

10/30/20, 10:50 AM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: ...it doesn't key in
10/30/20, 10:51 AM - Adafin: Having less than 2MB on up to 3 hours now
10/30/20, 10:51 AM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: What could be the cause of this?
10/30/20, 10:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm lost.
10/30/20, 10:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: What's the topic?

10/30/20, 11:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's a continuous journey.
One key is to choose what you want to learn guided by where you wanna go which should be guided by your interests and the opportunities in the areas in question. Otherwise, one will overstretch and it will become a waste.
10/30/20, 11:13 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Hmmmm
10/30/20, 11:13 AM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: I think am lost totally

Without turning on less secure apps access, one can follow the above link to setup app password that they can use without having to turn on the less secure app access button.

Tip: to set this up, you need to have setup up 2step authentication which is in the same settings window.

10/30/20, 7:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Amebo time*
So, let me tickle our fancy a bit with some stats from what we have streamed so far.

*Total Tweets* = 653,628
*(Tweets vs Retweets)* = (75,002, 578,626)
10/30/20, 7:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
10/30/20, 7:11 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Oya
10/30/20, 7:12 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: Are they actually driving conversations or their tweet got retweeted more?
10/30/20, 7:12 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You said the same thing in two different ways.
10/30/20, 7:13 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: I feel it should be the engagement within a tweet that may serve as 'driving conversations' or what do you think @2349081987335
10/30/20, 7:14 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: Like the number of replies not just retweet
10/30/20, 7:16 PM - Adafin: We're replies collected?
10/30/20, 7:17 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: What is the password? I have same issue yesterday @2349081987335
10/30/20, 7:18 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Cos me am lost üòìüòìüòì
10/30/20, 7:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Understanding how tweeted works will make you get the gist, thus:

Each retweet is actually a tweet in itself.
So, to trend, the each of the tweets and retweets need need to carry a particular topic.
For example, if #EndSARS is trending, all tweets (original tweets and retweets of those tweets) must carry this topic in order to have enough traction to trend (enough numbers). 

A tweet can have 40k replies and fail to *all* carry a common word (it could) or the tag #EndSARS in this our example. On the other hand, a tweet bearing #EndSARS gets retweeted (which is tweeting it again from the mouth of the original writer) 40k times. 

If we had one spot for a trend, which topic is going to seen by more users: one of 100s of a possible sample of 40k worth of replies or a single straight tweet written 40k times?
10/30/20, 7:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is a second good factor.
10/30/20, 7:27 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: You are correct.. Higher retweet makes it trend...
10/30/20, 7:28 PM - +234 905 870 2551: This thing is sweetü§©
10/30/20, 7:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This makes high net worth (guys with big followers) are hit for propaganda.
10/30/20, 7:28 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: I think there are 3 factors that contribute to a trending hash tag and retweet Leeds...
Likes, retweet, replies
10/30/20, 7:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sorry, the second ask for an email should actually be asking for your password, so input your password. It is a hidden field but it is taking your input all the same.
10/30/20, 7:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ‚úÖ
10/30/20, 7:30 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: It's because this 3 correlate.. There is a high tendency of one contributing to the other... You are wise Sir...
10/30/20, 7:30 PM - +234 703 385 3682: Wow, talking big data
10/30/20, 7:30 PM - +234 905 870 2551: I agree with this, replies doesn't always translate to engagement with the topic, most replies are just 'I follow for follow back', 'get your sneakers for 7k' etc
10/30/20, 7:30 PM - +234 703 385 3682: Let the analysis continue ‚úîÔ∏è
10/30/20, 7:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Twitter makes it hard to follow replies. I don't know if it is intentional. I have worked on a python module to try and reverse engineer it with the aid of Twython. But there are restrictions.
10/30/20, 7:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol.
Spot on.
You are a _tweep_
10/30/20, 7:34 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: True...
10/30/20, 7:34 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That was just an _amebo_ session as I onboarded the first set of set of data into a wareouse for storage.
10/30/20, 7:34 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: warehouse*
10/30/20, 7:36 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Boss of boss
10/30/20, 7:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I think I remember someone referring to a bootcamp and someone saying this here is one. I agree.

So, to promote learning, the following file is a copy of the notebook I used to onboard the data so far into an SQL Server DB. Poke around and see a thing or two even if you never get to use it.
10/30/20, 7:38 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: Me salute u oo

10/30/20, 7:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The notebook.

This as been sent to the google drive and the github repo.
10/30/20, 7:43 PM - +234 905 870 2551: What's a warehouse?
10/30/20, 7:45 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: Where you store data
10/30/20, 7:45 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: It's like a data store...
10/30/20, 7:46 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: For storing massive amounts of Data
10/30/20, 7:46 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: You know you keep things in your pc so to cut the long story See it as an online big pc  üòä
10/30/20, 7:47 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: üëåüèæ
10/30/20, 7:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A data warehouse is a storage for data but it has some peculiarities.
It is usually meant for analysis and so it is OLAP in structure as against OLTP.
The major difference is that one is optimized for taking data the other for spitting it out for analysis. This makes the latter faster and more suitable for use in analytics. The former is more suited for transactions.
Hit Google üòÅ
10/30/20, 7:50 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: This is why you are the boss....... Case close.. No more additions
10/30/20, 7:51 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Omo, Google go hear am
10/30/20, 7:51 PM - +234 905 870 2551: Oh so is it stored locally on the PC or like the cloud thing?
10/30/20, 7:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It could be a local server and it could cloud based.
10/30/20, 7:52 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: OLTP AND OLAP meaming

10/30/20, 7:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, don't be confused, suffice it to say that a single sql server can hold two different dbs one olap and one oltp. What matters is the structure of the db and its intended use.

Think transactions vs analytics.
10/30/20, 7:56 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Boss we wey no know SQL KO
10/30/20, 7:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Enough for tonight so we don't throw up too much notifications for folks who will come in later.

If any of these sounds interesting, read more about it or if you have specific questions you can share them later.

The most important thing is to be aware of that aspect of things. This is what they call _Data Engineering_.

The notebook basically uses python to communicate with an SQL here (here MS SQL Server).
10/30/20, 8:48 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Boss those using yahoo mail should send manually

Someone sent me a file with an older version to broke the onboarding flow on my end. 
Fixed though.

10/31/20, 12:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok. Good one.

Look around more to see id you can figure out how to do that.

Remember to experiment with a copy so the main script for our task is not affected.
10/31/20, 12:07 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: Sure thing Sir‚úåÔ∏è
10/31/20, 12:11 PM - Ade Jinadu 2NYP: ok Boss. Thanks a tonne
10/31/20, 1:36 PM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: You need to include 
Server.sendmail for the email you want to blind copy
10/31/20, 1:36 PM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: This is actually what sends the email
10/31/20, 2:16 PM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: Thanks boss. Will try that.

10/31/20, 8:06 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Boss please can I change my streaming time to night/dusk
10/31/20, 8:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: My only sadness at the implication not directly linked to the project. No or small data is still actionable info. The sad thing is that the tempo of the youth movement appears to be petering out rather fast. But then, it is a weekend and in Nigeria, we take our football seriously.
10/31/20, 8:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes you can.
Update the roster accordingly so I can have a full view of where we are.
10/31/20, 8:07 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Ok boss
10/31/20, 8:07 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: #EndSARS still doing quite well tho. Thankfully.
10/31/20, 8:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea right.
The data I am getting from you guys on EndSARS shows serious activity still.
10/31/20, 8:12 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I feel the activity is reducing tho... I stream for longer periods.
10/31/20, 8:26 PM - Daniel Michael 2NYP: Done
10/31/20, 8:44 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: Do we still need more from #endbadgovernment
10/31/20, 8:50 PM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: How is that possible
10/31/20, 8:52 PM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: It is very possible oooo
I've had my share of the experience too
10/31/20, 8:54 PM - Akande Adeola 2NYP: Which keyword
10/31/20, 9:05 PM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: EndSWAT

11/1/20, 9:24 PM - Adafin: I am getting an error for second instance
11/1/20, 9:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: what is it saying?
11/1/20, 9:25 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Thank you very much.
11/1/20, 9:26 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: I think @2349081987335 mentioned once that you can run up to 4 or 3 scripts concurrently
11/1/20, 9:26 PM - Adafin: WORKING NOW
11/1/20, 9:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: üëç
11/1/20, 9:26 PM - Iyiola Daniel Okikioluwa 2YNP: Great... üí™üèæ
11/1/20, 9:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea.
Max 3, the last time I checked.
11/1/20, 11:03 PM - Seyi Cmp 2NYP: Good evening house... For team that will be extracting tweets in the middle of the night, the keywords are: #Obigbo,#ObigboIsBleeding and #ObigboMassacre
11/1/20, 11:06 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: For all?
11/1/20, 11:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is added to the topic u have. You can indicate you are picking up one or two from those.
11/1/20, 11:14 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: interesting but won't there be a clash
11/1/20, 11:14 PM - Richie AskPyFesh: i thought its normally assigned
11/1/20, 11:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is in addition to what one is on.

So what's expected is that the team members indicate they are picking one from the list or two as the case may be so that duplicates won't fall in.

In the event we get duplicates at the end of the day, the onboarding will drop them.
11/1/20, 11:20 PM - John Gabriel 2NYP: #ObigboMassacre...streaming dat now and is trending
11/2/20, 12:03 AM - Oluwatobi Adeniji 2NYP: Please confirm if it is Obigbo or Oyigbo?

11/2/20, 2:04 AM - Esther Adetoro Adedeji 2NYP: Hi everyone 

Good morning 

Please anyone knows how to recover a file that was never deleted  from a folder?.....I think there was a mix up while cut and pasting into the appropriate folder.
11/2/20, 2:05 AM - Esther Adetoro Adedeji 2NYP: 2 json files just disappeared from the main folder somehow
11/2/20, 2:06 AM - Esther Adetoro Adedeji 2NYP: I have checked my recycle bin, it's not found there
11/2/20, 4:36 AM - Andikan Mfon 2NYP: @2349081987335 Boss, you said something about posting an analysis of our activities in this group so far.

Was eagerly looking forward to that.

11/2/20, 9:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No tag on those. Couldn't answer earlier.
11/2/20, 9:58 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ctrl + Z would have solved this when it happened but I dunno how long it's been now. Might not work now.

11/2/20, 11:01 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Apart from our assigned topics, our trendsetters are expected to tell us of new trends not on the list but related, from time to time so we can pick n listen for them too. they are one time its. Once they go mainstream we assign them as topics.
