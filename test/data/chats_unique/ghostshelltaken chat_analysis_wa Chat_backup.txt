[29/04/20, 6:46:23 PM] Rahi: The lesson there was if you don’t know how to open a door, you should not close with your intelligence
[29/04/20, 6:46:57 PM] Rahi: Like if you can’t hack your own security system, you are not a good cyber security programmer

[29/04/20, 6:50:01 PM] Rahi: It is shown that it really didn’t work out between karishma and nikhil
[29/04/20, 6:50:26 PM] Rahi: But they were getting married because they were not in love with each other, they were in love with the thought of love

[29/04/20, 6:53:19 PM] Rahi: So the thing is if family don’t accept who you are, you should not stop being you
[29/04/20, 6:53:44 PM] Rahi: These things are silent things and some comedy is also there
[29/04/20, 6:53:48 PM] Rahi: Because of gujju family

[29/04/20, 6:57:33 PM] Chaitanya: 5 minutes up
[29/04/20, 6:57:50 PM] Rahi: Karishma kept breaking up because she knew that he would come bacj

[29/04/20, 6:58:03 PM] Rahi: Done chalo
[29/04/20, 6:59:34 PM] Chaitanya: First of all, I would like to start my speech with........I acknowledge that it wasn't regular movie but that doesn't mean that bollywood made a good movie
[29/04/20, 7:00:25 PM] Chaitanya: Movie depends upon many factors only factor was good in this movie was story
[29/04/20, 7:01:42 PM] Chaitanya: Love is objective for each and every one
[29/04/20, 7:02:49 PM] Chaitanya: if you think you can get "THE ONE" you gotta ask your self, Does that time really worth spending finding "THE ONE"?
[29/04/20, 7:03:16 PM] Chaitanya: Instead you can have what you can get in between journey!
[29/04/20, 7:03:48 PM] Chaitanya: At the end isn't it all about journey and people who we meet rather then finding that perfect person
[29/04/20, 7:04:43 PM] Chaitanya: And I am not saying you couldn't find but it's idea is like "TIME TRAVEL IS REAL"
[29/04/20, 7:06:01 PM] Chaitanya: I like Italian philosophy rather than finding love, accept what you get and if you think that is not enough you can always backtrack
[29/04/20, 7:06:52 PM] Chaitanya: I don't like how this movie type of movie, keeps our expectations very high
[29/04/20, 7:08:01 PM] Chaitanya: Not saying that is bad it's fine but you gotta be optimistic rathen then idolist
[29/04/20, 7:09:07 PM] Chaitanya: Personally I feel the idea of whole marriege is just a contract, people want to be miserable

[29/04/20, 7:14:26 PM] Chaitanya: And most of don't find the perfect one(SINCE OUR EXPECTATION WAS HIGH and WE WERE IDOLIST) and then we end up being miserabel
[29/04/20, 7:14:34 PM] Rahi: Well that 7 years do even matter!!
[29/04/20, 7:16:01 PM] Chaitanya: There are only hadful of people who can say we are happily married
[29/04/20, 7:16:56 PM] Chaitanya: But there are more people who can say we are happy in relationship then why ruin this thing with some contract
[29/04/20, 7:18:16 PM] Chaitanya: "We all want the love we can't have, but at the same time won't accept the love we can get"!
