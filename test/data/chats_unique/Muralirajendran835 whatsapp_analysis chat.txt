9/20/21, 7:35 PM - Vishnu Priya: Dear Sir / Madam,

Greetings of the day from AICTE.

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has been taking various initiatives, policy recommendations & projects towards creating an industry-ready workforce. To objectively measure the industry readiness of engineering graduates, CII has launched the Industrial Proficiency Aptitude Test (iPATE).  This is a unique assessment test of industrial aptitude of engineers.  This test examines the students core engineering skills from a practical / user perspective and provides them a certification.

The CII iPATE 1.0, which was conducted last year, was very successful with more than 12,000 students taking the test and numerous companies referred to the scores (as one of the parameters for assessing industry readiness of candidates) during their recruitment process.  The CII iPATE 2.0 examination is likely to be held in December 2021.

In this context, AICTE & CII will be jointly organising an awareness programme on 21st September 2021 from 1100 hrs. onwards covering various aspects of iPATE 2.0.  Interested students & faculty members may register themselves, latest by 1400 hrs. of 20th Sep 2021 vide the Google Form at the following link:
üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá

https://forms.gle/Z9mMp28vvCJkJY4X7

The above link may kindly be shared with the students / faulty members of your institution pl.
Webex link for the awareness programme will be emailed to the registered participants by 1700 hrs. on 20th Sep 2021.

Looking forward to your kind participation in the above awareness programme  please.

9/27/21, 9:58 PM - Vishnu Priya: Guys please make sure that given criteria are fulfilled when you select your Electives.
PSC- Professional Soft Core
PE -  Professional Elective

For Regular Students:-
Choose 3 PSC such that the total 4PSCs that you read (including 5th semester's PSC-1) fetches you atleast 20 credits, (i.e., combined there has to be atleast 2 Lab courses in the 4 PSCs).
Choose 1 PE from any track (there is a requirement that by the end of 8th semester you have atleast explored 4 tracks, but right now there is no need to worry)

For Honors Students:-
2 PSC (again such that total credits are >= 20 in PSCs) and 1 PE is compulsory.
2 extra subjects have to be taken, you could take them from either PSC or PE, fill the choices accordingly.

Take a look at the RUSA Curriculum pdf that was sent in the WhatsApp group for getting information on what each subject's credits are.

Many of you texted me saying that viva test on Saturday was inconvenient. Ma'am said that viva will be taken for those who are available this Saturday (23/10/21) and for the remaining, it shall be taken next Saturday (30/10/21). Some had a problem with the test being on a Saturday. So, in the excel sheet mention if you're available this Saturday and whether you prefer the test to be conducted on weekdays / or in the weekend. If majority has a problem with weekends, ma'am might consider shifting the viva to weekdays (instead of next Saturday).
