[15/07/2018, 11:59:20] Emily Wade: Going for pizza, and booking a flight to Bangkok instead of getting the ferry, because it will save time so can spend an extra 2 days here, and also less likely to throw up haha

[01/09/2019, 19:36:30] Sis: what have u done
[01/09/2019, 19:36:32] Dad: you’re definitely different 😂😂😂
[01/09/2019, 19:36:40] Emily Wade: Tryna sort lifts to and from airport to cut costs for Cyprus .... lifts there all sorted .... but lifts back are a must because there’s no trains that late .... appreciate Mum will have school next morn and Dad has some peak working hours at the mo so no worries at all if not ..... but wondering if either of u could manage a lift on 15th at 23:50 .....
[01/09/2019, 19:36:49] Emily Wade: No stress if not
[01/09/2019, 19:36:59] Emily Wade: One person could drive and park there
[01/09/2019, 19:37:52] Emily Wade: But some people being unreasonable and annoying about splitting costs of parking between us all
[01/09/2019, 19:38:12] Emily Wade: But yeh thought I’d just double check that u don’t have a rare morning off or something lols
[01/09/2019, 19:38:14] Emily Wade: X x
[01/09/2019, 19:38:21] Sis: uber?
[01/09/2019, 19:38:44] Mum: Tell them to get a grip .. one person driving seems the solution I think xx
[01/09/2019, 19:39:22] Dad: from where though ?   you didn’t say 😂😂
[01/09/2019, 19:41:05] Emily Wade: Gatwick
[01/09/2019, 19:41:21] Emily Wade: Soz
[01/09/2019, 19:42:20] Sis: uber is between 69-92 if u split that its not major money
[01/09/2019, 19:42:40] Emily Wade: Between 4 ppl u mad ????
[01/09/2019, 19:43:07] Sis: thats 20 quid
[01/09/2019, 19:43:16] Emily Wade: Yeh and parking is 10 each
[01/09/2019, 19:43:21] Emily Wade: But ty
[01/09/2019, 19:43:51] Dad: and my sleep - priceless 👍😀
[01/09/2019, 19:44:52] Dad: sorry .... can’t help that night .... would ruin the morning for work .... sorry

[02/09/2019, 19:28:58] Emily Wade: Ok ..... so .......
[02/09/2019, 19:29:07] Emily Wade: Apparently lift back is now sorted
[02/09/2019, 19:29:16] Emily Wade: Can I ask 2 favours
[02/09/2019, 19:29:18] Emily Wade: The first
[02/09/2019, 19:29:22] Emily Wade: And most important
[02/09/2019, 19:29:35] Emily Wade: Because David’s mum took us there
[02/09/2019, 19:29:54] Emily Wade: Are u able to bring us back from Gatwick on Saturday morning?
[02/09/2019, 19:30:04] Emily Wade: If not it’s ok there’s obviously trains
[02/09/2019, 19:30:14] Emily Wade: But she is also saying she can now pick us up
[02/09/2019, 19:30:21] Emily Wade: And is more fair to split
[02/09/2019, 19:30:28] Emily Wade: If that makes sense
[02/09/2019, 19:30:38] Emily Wade: If it suits?

[02/09/2019, 19:32:19] Emily Wade: Both morning lifts
[02/09/2019, 19:32:50] Emily Wade: My priority is for me and David cos his mum is just always wanting to lift but she deserves to not do both lifts
[02/09/2019, 19:32:58] Mum: What times on both days ?
[02/09/2019, 19:33:08] Emily Wade: By if by any chance is possible to do both would be MASSIVELY in ur favour
[02/09/2019, 19:33:53] Emily Wade: I can pay / cook u yummy dinners (inc. meat if u must) / hoover / put my glasses in dishwasher

[09/02/2021, 17:36:59] Dad: Try this and dont cheat ... it’s amazing. 

EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY IT !!!!

This is an ALZHEIMERS EYE 👁‍🗨 TEST

(I love this part ...
 It's absolutely amazing!)

Count every "  F  " in the following text:

FINISHED  FILES ARE THE RE
SULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTI
FIC STUDY COMBINED  WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS.

Now see below. 


HOW MANY?
  
3 ... or 4 ... ?





WRONG,  THERE ARE  6  --  no joke.
READ IT AGAIN!
Go on read it again. 

Really, go Back and Try to find the 6 Fs before you scroll down.


The reasoning behind this is  further down.





Apparently the brain cannot process "OF" 

Incredible or what? 
Go back and look again!!

Anyone who counts  all 6 "Fs” on the first go is a genius.

Three is normal, four is quite rare. 

Send this to your friends. 
It will drive them crazy!!:
Good isn’t it.
