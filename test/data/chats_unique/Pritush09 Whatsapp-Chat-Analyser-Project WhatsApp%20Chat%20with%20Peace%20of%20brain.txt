8/7/22, 22:31 - +91 96749 45393: Hello @everyone do we need to learn oops  in python or basic python is enough?
8/7/22, 22:33 - +91 97962 76986: Oops is necessary to use library like sklearn
Because concept of class and objects use there
8/7/22, 22:34 - +91 96749 45393: Ok thanks and dsa ?
8/7/22, 22:34 - +91 97962 76986: Not necessary

8/7/22, 23:07 - Anurag Banerjee CampusX Disord: It is being difficult for me to proceed after covered EDA .
I am a little bit confused . Can anyone help me?
8/7/22, 23:09 - +91 6307 119 980: Bro share your problem
8/7/22, 23:13 - Anurag Banerjee CampusX Disord: In tge moat basic project like iris dataset I have done plotting s dimensional reduction . Now I am doing PCA. But what to do after that. I mean what is the bridge between EDA and Ml model fitting?
8/7/22, 23:16 - +1 (501) 554-6742: I started learning python a month ago and took this codebasic course which included python project in data analysis
8/7/22, 23:16 - Pritush Singh: If it is not very high dimensional data them there is no need to do pca
8/7/22, 23:17 - +1 (501) 554-6742: But I want to learn more about the basics of python build logic and stuff
8/7/22, 23:17 - +1 (501) 554-6742: I do know ML
8/7/22, 23:17 - Pritush Singh: Feature engineering
8/7/22, 23:17 - +1 (501) 554-6742: but want to be able to code logic in python also
8/7/22, 23:18 - Pritush Singh: It take time bro just keep going for it
8/7/22, 23:18 - +1 (501) 554-6742: Whats pca?
8/7/22, 23:18 - Pritush Singh: Principal component analysis
8/7/22, 23:18 - +1 (501) 554-6742: Yep
8/7/22, 23:20 - +1 (501) 554-6742: If someone has some set of practice questions that would help build logic
8/7/22, 23:20 - +1 (501) 554-6742: Oh
8/7/22, 23:23 - +91 97962 76986: Start solving codechef problem..

8/7/22, 23:37 - +91 6307 119 980: If u do dimension reduction tha  why u use pca
8/7/22, 23:38 - +91 6307 119 980: Pca is mainly use of dimension reduction in data analysis
8/7/22, 23:38 - +91 6307 119 980: Than*
8/7/22, 23:38 - Anurag Banerjee CampusX Disord: Okay. No it was just part of learning. But i have not done it in the Ml model
8/7/22, 23:39 - +91 6307 119 980: I can't understand your doubt
8/7/22, 23:39 - +91 6307 119 980: Elaborate it
8/7/22, 23:41 - Anurag Banerjee CampusX Disord: I was just learning pca just  for future use . 
Actually I have not impliment it in the ML model of Iris dataset

8/9/22, 22:44 - +91 83759 93027: Hello, I just started with deep learning. Can anyone suggest where to run dl models? Google colab is taking a lot of time to train the model.
8/9/22, 22:45 - +91 70118 02993: They all sucks but I use kaggle
8/9/22, 22:52 - +91 76719 88153: Kaggle is the one of the best option
8/9/22, 22:53 - +91 6307 119 980: Hii everyone let's organize a test/game in which we ask python/ml questions to each other's and check how people think to solve our problems
8/9/22, 22:54 - +91 6307 119 980: Tell me can we conduct??
8/9/22, 22:54 - +91 6307 119 980: Which is helpful in competitive programing

8/10/22, 11:26 - +91 81008 54915: The error is related to web dynos thingy which is necessary to run web deployed web apps in heroku. Probably your web dynos has scaled to 0. Change it to 1.
8/10/22, 11:28 - +91 6307 119 980: Mera ko bhi yeh hii lag raha hai

8/10/22, 12:03 - +91 81008 54915: You have written that code in procfile. Procfile should be one liner to run the code while deployment.

8/10/22, 12:28 - +91 81008 54915: First remove the scaling code from procfile. Second, rename the procfile to "Procfile". P should be uppercase.

8/10/22, 13:26 - +91 88579 60454: And error solve

8/10/22, 13:53 - +91 93547 50158: Change the file name simple file name without giving path in github
8/10/22, 13:58 - +91 81008 54915: Correct the path. Check if the file you are trying to access in the code, is present in that given path directory or not.

8/10/22, 19:59 - +91 96644 81103: Advance excel, SQL, powerbi/tableau...i think this tool enough for start data analysis fresher and after that, u can learn python..
8/10/22, 20:01 - +91 96644 81103: I think both are similar but.in business analyst u can add one more thing communication.

8/10/22, 20:03 - +91 97962 76986: Which one is best to deploy Ml models ? 
Flask or streamlit
8/10/22, 20:07 - +91 70118 02993: Data analytics is proper where you analyse any type of data and  business analyst where you analyse the data which is business specific
8/10/22, 20:08 - +91 6307 119 980: Streamlt
8/10/22, 20:08 - +91 6307 119 980: I think
8/10/22, 20:08 - +91 6307 119 980: Flask is difficult

8/10/22, 22:38 - +91 81008 54915: If you are a beginner, go with Streamlit. I've used it and its super fun.
If you are an intermediate and your project requires more tweek and customisation, go with Flask/Django.(Haven't used it, speaking with what I've heard of)
8/11/22, 07:22 - +91 90239 75450: Yes it's great
8/11/22, 07:22 - +91 90239 75450: If you're a intermediate, and don't want to make it complex then go with Flask or FastAPI, if you wanna make some advance project with more customizations and all, then go with Djnago.

8/21/22, 17:43 - +91 95603 53768: Hey guys, Can anyone help me with this? I am working on an ML model to predict expected CTC. *Problem*: Suppose I want to know if a certain categorical variable is relevant for predicting this variable, I am opting to assess the boxplot of this categorical feature for different levels. Is there a better way to assess this relationship? In simpler terms, I want to know if expected CTC changes when organization of the candidate is different.
8/21/22, 17:44 - +91 95603 53768: <Media omitted>
This is my boxplot.
8/21/22, 17:44 - +91 90239 75450: I would suggest you to do this :

df.corr()
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: Or plot pie chart , histplot , or something else
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 95603 53768: But the feature is categorical. I am not sure if correlation makes sense for a categorical feature
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: If it is really categorical vs numerical
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: Ohh
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: So use pie chart
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: Or histograms
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: Or bar charts
8/21/22, 17:45 - +91 90239 75450: Heat maps are also best
8/21/22, 17:47 - +91 95603 53768: Could you elaborate how would pie chart help? Pie chart would just tell me the distribution of the count of candidates from different organizations whereas I am looking to understand the impact of organization on expected CTC. I mean to say, pie charts are for univariate analysis.
8/21/22, 17:48 - +91 90239 75450: No no
8/21/22, 17:48 - +91 90239 75450: See
8/21/22, 17:48 - +91 90239 75450: I'm not telling that use only pie chart
8/21/22, 17:48 - +91 90239 75450: What I'm trying to say is
8/21/22, 17:48 - +91 90239 75450: Use other plots also
8/21/22, 17:49 - +91 90239 75450: Like you can get some and some kind of info from all different plots
8/21/22, 17:49 - +91 90239 75450: And use your own understanding at the end
8/21/22, 17:49 - +91 95603 53768: What do you make out of this plot?
8/21/22, 17:50 - +91 90239 75450: See
8/21/22, 17:50 - +91 90239 75450: Very simple
8/21/22, 17:50 - +91 90239 75450: Freshers are in that range where CTC is very low
8/21/22, 17:50 - +91 90239 75450: Isn't it ?
8/21/22, 17:50 - +91 90239 75450: What does this A B D T F letters are ?
8/21/22, 17:51 - +91 95603 53768: Name of the organizations
8/21/22, 17:51 - +91 90239 75450: Hih
8/21/22, 17:51 - +91 90239 75450: Then why did you plot this plot
8/21/22, 17:51 - +91 90239 75450: Means you want to know which organisation pays highest and lowest ctc
8/21/22, 17:51 - +91 90239 75450: Like that ?
8/21/22, 17:52 - +91 90239 75450: You wanna basically compare paying scale of different organisations?
8/21/22, 17:52 - +91 95603 53768: Yes
8/21/22, 17:52 - +91 90239 75450: Oh
8/21/22, 17:52 - +91 90239 75450: So simple bro
8/21/22, 17:52 - +91 90239 75450: Use bar plot
8/21/22, 17:52 - +91 90239 75450: Heatmaps
8/21/22, 17:53 - +91 90239 75450: And histograms
8/21/22, 17:53 - +91 90239 75450: Plot these 3
8/21/22, 17:54 - +91 95603 53768: In my view, the median expected CTC across organizations is more or less equal. The 25th percentile, 75th percentile values are also very similar. That's why I implied that it doesn't matter which organization is the candidate coming from, the expected CTC is kind of independent of this feature.
8/21/22, 17:55 - +91 90239 75450: But bro
8/21/22, 17:55 - +91 90239 75450: In real world scenario it is not acceptable
8/21/22, 17:55 - +91 90239 75450: May be according to your data , your expectations can be true
8/21/22, 17:55 - +91 90239 75450: But still i suggests that your decision is 99% accurate
8/21/22, 17:56 - +91 90239 75450: As Q1 and Q3 values are same for all categories
8/21/22, 17:56 - +91 90239 75450: But bro
8/21/22, 17:56 - +91 90239 75450: Also scale is important
8/21/22, 17:56 - +91 90239 75450: In which scale your CTC is
8/21/22, 17:56 - +91 90239 75450: Like LPA or ?
8/21/22, 17:57 - +91 90239 75450: Bit you should still try plotting them for being more accurate
8/21/22, 17:57 - +91 95603 53768: LPA
8/21/22, 17:57 - +91 90239 75450: Sorry If you feel I'm wrong üòÖ
8/21/22, 17:57 - +91 90239 75450: Yes

8/25/22, 00:00 - +91 6307 119 980: Anyone tell me how to identify the numerical data in data frame
8/25/22, 00:01 - +91 6307 119 980: It should belong to categorical data ( nominal) or numerical
8/25/22, 00:02 - +91 6307 119 980: If there are 250 rows. 
150 unique value (numerical) than it should be categorical or numerical?
8/25/22, 00:03 - +91 70118 02993: Hona to numerical hi chahiye pr Ye dataset pr bhi depend krta hai
8/25/22, 00:05 - +91 6307 119 980: Agar kissne simply pooch liya tb kya batao gye
8/25/22, 00:05 - +91 70118 02993: Numerical hai bro
8/25/22, 00:05 - +91 6307 119 980: Some value will be repeat
8/25/22, 00:06 - +91 70118 02993: Possible hai
8/25/22, 00:06 - +91 6307 119 980: Than why it's not categorical?
8/25/22, 00:06 - +91 6307 119 980: 150 categories
8/25/22, 00:06 - +91 70118 02993: Isilye to bola bro dataset pr depend krta hai ye
8/25/22, 00:07 - +91 70118 02993: Can you tell me about that column
8/25/22, 00:07 - +91 70118 02993: What type of value and feature name
8/25/22, 00:07 - +91 70118 02993: ?
8/25/22, 00:08 - +91 6307 119 980: mera ko bhut confusion hoti thi issliye yaad aaya too poocha liya
8/25/22, 00:08 - +91 6307 119 980: Let take an example
8/25/22, 00:08 - +91 70118 02993: Ok k
8/25/22, 00:08 - +91 6307 119 980: Age
8/25/22, 00:09 - +91 6307 119 980: All the student age is unique than its categorical or numerical?
8/25/22, 00:10 - +91 70118 02993: it also depends, how you're using that age column
8/25/22, 00:10 - +91 6307 119 980: According to u what are the difference between categorical or numerical data?
8/25/22, 00:11 - +91 6307 119 980: Explain without example
8/25/22, 00:12 - +91 70118 02993: See used age column as categorical and numerically both
8/25/22, 00:13 - +91 70118 02993: It is difficult to explain it here
8/25/22, 00:15 - +91 6307 119 980: Why?
8/25/22, 00:15 - +91 6307 119 980: Try
8/25/22, 00:16 - +91 6307 119 980: Give your opinion
8/25/22, 00:16 - +91 6307 119 980: What others think

8/25/22, 00:18 - +91 70118 02993: Thivideo you will get an idea
8/25/22, 00:18 - +91 70430 80911: In categorical data
The data number points are finite means usually limited or fixed
In case of numerical infinite
Unlimited or unfixed
8/25/22, 00:19 - +91 70430 80911: His explanation is really amazing
Watch it
8/25/22, 00:19 - +91 6307 119 980: But data set contains finite number of rows
8/25/22, 00:19 - +91 70430 80911: Numerical
8/25/22, 00:20 - +91 6307 119 980: .
8/25/22, 00:20 - +91 70430 80911: If we have
1 million rows but
Gender columns have only
2 values
Male female
Means
Categorical
8/25/22, 00:20 - +91 70118 02993: Yeah but sometimes it plays the role of being categorical too
8/25/22, 00:20 - +91 6307 119 980: Yes
8/25/22, 00:20 - +91 6307 119 980: Grouping
8/25/22, 00:21 - +91 70430 80911: In majority
Categorical
8/25/22, 00:21 - +91 70430 80911: That's a place where
Domain knowledge comes into the picture
8/25/22, 00:21 - +91 6307 119 980: 100 percent
8/25/22, 00:22 - +91 6307 119 980: Sequence number ?
8/25/22, 00:23 - +91 70430 80911: Anyone knows about

8/25/22, 00:23 - +91 70430 80911: ?
8/25/22, 00:24 - +91 70118 02993: Little bit
8/25/22, 00:24 - +91 6307 119 980: Yes
8/25/22, 00:24 - +91 70430 80911: Pipeline?
8/25/22, 00:24 - +91 70430 80911: Column transformer

8/25/22, 00:25 - +91 70430 80911: Use carefully and respectively in daily life
8/25/22, 00:25 - +91 70430 80911: It's needed
8/25/22, 00:25 - +91 6307 119 980: Joblin also use for that?
8/25/22, 00:25 - +91 97962 76986: Krish ki video hai ispe , mercedes benz data set pe
8/25/22, 00:25 - +91 70430 80911: Joblin?
8/25/22, 00:26 - +91 70430 80911: I don't know about it
8/25/22, 00:26 - +91 70430 80911: Explain me little bit
8/25/22, 00:26 - +91 6307 119 980: @917011802993 u?
8/25/22, 00:26 - +91 70430 80911: Joblib
8/25/22, 00:26 - +91 70118 02993: No idea bro
8/25/22, 00:26 - +91 70430 80911: Yes
You can use
8/25/22, 00:27 - +91 70430 80911: But
I use pipeline as a main stream
8/25/22, 00:27 - +91 70430 80911: In industry
They use pipelining
8/25/22, 00:27 - +91 70118 02993: Can you give me a glimpse of it
8/25/22, 00:28 - +91 6307 119 980: Joblib having extra functionality
8/25/22, 00:28 - +91 70118 02993: Little idea about it !
8/25/22, 00:29 - +91 70430 80911: We do multiple steps with data
Like
Feature engineering
- scaling
- encoding
Model training
Hyper parameter tuning
In this whole process
Handing data is too difficult
So with the help of pipeling
We can handle this entire
Process seamlessly

8/25/22, 00:39 - +91 70118 02993: can you share
8/25/22, 00:39 - +91 70430 80911: Means project topics
8/25/22, 00:39 - +91 70118 02993: yeah
8/25/22, 00:39 - +91 70430 80911: Sure
I'll
8/25/22, 00:44 - +91 91637 83410: Should I learn SQL first after python? or should I learn Statistics?
8/25/22, 00:45 - +91 70430 80911: It depends on you
At the end of the day
All these 3 skills are important
8/25/22, 00:45 - +91 70430 80911: Whichever you like do first
8/25/22, 00:45 - +91 70430 80911: Of do in parallel
8/25/22, 00:46 - +91 70430 80911: Are you from which background
8/25/22, 00:46 - +91 70430 80911: ?
8/25/22, 00:46 - +91 91637 83410: If sql which sql I should learn? Mysql or postgre or any other sql?
8/25/22, 00:47 - +91 91637 83410: ECE background with python knowledge
8/25/22, 00:47 - +91 70430 80911: Don't worry more about database
Just learn SQL for mysql
8/25/22, 00:47 - +91 70430 80911: So just brush your knowledge in python and Start statistics with code
8/25/22, 00:48 - +91 70430 80911: Use padnas for statistics
8/25/22, 00:48 - +91 70430 80911: Implement that
8/25/22, 00:48 - +91 91637 83410: Okay! and after learning visualization start with sql?
8/25/22, 00:49 - +91 70430 80911: Visualization with
Seaborn and matplotlib
8/25/22, 00:49 - +91 70430 80911: Python libraries
8/25/22, 00:49 - +91 91637 83410: Okieee
8/25/22, 00:49 - +91 91637 83410: Then I'll be keeping SQL for later I guess
8/25/22, 00:50 - +91 70430 80911: Yes
No worries
Just 
Do at the end with full energy
8/25/22, 00:50 - +91 91637 83410: Yeah
8/25/22, 00:50 - +91 70430 80911: These are just libraries
You should also 
Gain knowledge about
Univariate bivariate and multivariate analysis
8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: And different types of graph
8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: Line plot
8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: Bar plot

8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: Heat plot
8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: Where to use
8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: How to use
8/25/22, 00:51 - +91 70430 80911: This kind of things

8/25/22, 08:33 - +91 95603 53768: *Two methods*
1. df.info() : Look for your choice of data types
2.df.select_dtypes(include=['int','float'])
8/25/22, 08:34 - +91 70430 80911: Int float
Instead of use
np.number
8/25/22, 08:35 - +91 70430 80911: How can we decide categorical and numerical  with info method
8/25/22, 08:36 - +91 70430 80911: Info will give the 
Dtype 
But dtype is not enough to
Justify to solve this problem
8/25/22, 08:37 - +91 95603 53768: Categorical data types are object or category. Numerical data types are int and float.
8/25/22, 08:38 - +91 70430 80911: What if 
I have column like
Loan declined or not 
Declined is with 0
And accept 1
8/25/22, 08:38 - +91 70430 80911: Then
8/25/22, 08:38 - +91 95603 53768: It may be Boolean
8/25/22, 08:39 - +91 95603 53768: bool in terms of pandas
8/25/22, 08:39 - +91 70430 80911: üòÖ
You are in a right direction
Btw i admire your solution
8/25/22, 08:40 - +91 70430 80911: We can get this ans. Upto some extend
8/25/22, 08:40 - +91 95603 53768: My preferred choice is always df.select_dtypes
8/25/22, 08:40 - +91 70430 80911: Beyond this
Stakeholder have to decide this
8/25/22, 08:40 - +91 70430 80911: With include exclude parameters
8/25/22, 08:41 - +91 95603 53768: Yes
8/25/22, 08:41 - +91 70430 80911: But brother
The case which i mentioned
Your solution will not be work
8/25/22, 08:41 - +91 70430 80911: That's what I'm telling to you
8/25/22, 08:41 - +91 70430 80911: ...
8/25/22, 08:41 - +91 70430 80911: Just think about it
8/25/22, 08:42 - +91 70430 80911: Although you're right 
Upto some extend
8/25/22, 09:32 - +91 81008 54915: This can include non-boolean ordinal data.

8/25/22, 21:29 - +91 70118 02993: Mentor support is very important
8/25/22, 21:32 - +91 88510 84852: Yup

8/27/22, 10:07 - +91 81008 54915: Wrong group bro
8/27/22, 10:12 - +91 6307 119 980: If u know than give hint so that it's helpful for that
8/27/22, 10:18 - +91 84400 47929: things will not work here like these. You have to try and if some error happens then ask for help. I urge everyone not to share link of group like this , its not assignment ans group.
8/27/22, 10:24 - +91 6307 119 980: Bro explain your problems in that question
8/27/22, 10:24 - +91 6307 119 980: Then group members will help u
8/27/22, 11:12 - +91 81008 54915: Its not about the hint. Its about the methodologies of how things work here. Nobody has time to answer a random exam paper questions. If you have, I appreciate your efforts. Anybody can ask conceptual doubts or bugs regarding their work but not by sending the entire exam paper. 
Plus, what I also meant previously is that, you can't rely on a random group to answer your time bounded exam paper right? Its better to clear it with your batchmates, or maybe in the college's unofficial group.
