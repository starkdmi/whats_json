2021/03/28, 14:37 - Nabeel: I think that's why we're gonna meet up with our supervisor, so he can explain the whole thing to us
2021/03/28, 14:46 - +27 72 101 9695: I can add pravesh to the discord server and limit the access he has 🤷‍♂️
2021/03/28, 14:46 - +27 72 101 9695: Then maybe we can speak to him on specific channels only 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021/03/28, 14:50 - +27 84 485 6965: Yea I think that's a good idea ✨
2021/03/29, 10:28 - +27 74 760 1963: Guys
2021/03/29, 10:29 - +27 74 760 1963: We're meeting today right? We need to discuss Taiga.io and everything
2021/03/29, 11:22 - +27 72 101 9695: Yup
2021/03/29, 11:23 - +27 72 101 9695: The lab session is at 2 right ?
2021/03/29, 11:23 - +27 84 485 6965: Yipz
2021/03/29, 11:23 - +27 72 101 9695: Are we meeting with the tutor on me teams ?
2021/03/29, 11:23 - +27 72 101 9695: Ms*
2021/03/29, 13:25 - Nabeel: Yep I think so. But we should ask him today if we could move it discord from next week.
2021/03/29, 13:27 - +27 74 760 1963: So nothing today at 14:00?
2021/03/29, 13:28 - +27 72 101 9695: Can we still meet on discord at 2
2021/03/29, 13:28 - +27 72 101 9695: I just wanna discuss taiga and git
2021/03/29, 13:28 - +27 74 760 1963: No problem
2021/03/29, 13:28 - +27 72 101 9695: Shouldn't take long ... Like 20 min 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021/03/29, 13:28 - ZEE STEENEVELDT: The power in my area is down and I’m not sure when it’ll be fixed. I probably won’t be able to make the meeting
2021/03/29, 13:29 - +27 72 101 9695: It's cool.. I will also post a summary in the announcement channel
2021/03/29, 13:29 - +268 7944 7843: <Media omitted>
2021/03/29, 13:29 - Nabeel: Okay cool
2021/03/29, 13:29 - ZEE STEENEVELDT: Thank you 🍁
2021/03/29, 13:30 - Nabeel: Also we need to decide on a date to meet Pravesh
2021/03/29, 13:30 - +27 72 101 9695: @26879447843 I think you still need to join the server 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
2021/03/29, 13:31 - +268 7944 7843: Oh, right... been meaning to do that 😅
2021/03/29, 13:31 - Matthew: @27721019695 have you looked at those docs he sent in the ms teams?
2021/03/29, 13:32 - +27 72 101 9695: Yeah I have... I'm a bit confused by a few things (travis ci)..
2021/03/29, 13:32 - +27 72 101 9695: That's partly why I wanted to meet now
2021/03/29, 13:42 - Nabeel: Where was this message?
2021/03/29, 13:42 - Matthew: Ms teams...
2021/03/29, 13:42 - Matthew: I personally never open up ms teams
2021/03/29, 13:43 - +27 72 101 9695: Same 😂... It's such a waste of time
2021/03/29, 13:44 - Nabeel: Weird I can't find it 😂
2021/03/29, 13:48 - Matthew: It's in the group 5 chat
2021/03/29, 13:56 - +27 84 485 6965: Just lemme know when we starting the meeting please ✨
2021/03/29, 13:56 - +27 74 760 1963: Co-say
2021/03/29, 13:56 - +27 72 101 9695: will do
2021/03/29, 13:57 - +27 72 101 9695: im ready to start
2021/03/29, 13:57 - +27 74 760 1963: You can start
2021/03/29, 13:58 - +27 74 760 1963: Discord right?
2021/03/29, 13:58 - +27 72 101 9695: yup
2021/03/29, 13:58 - +27 74 760 1963: Awesome
2021/03/29, 14:00 - +27 72 101 9695: https://discord.gg/R9nmtw3B
2021/03/29, 14:00 - +27 64 823 8569: Hi, how long will the meeting take? I'm not at home so I'll be late. Will join the meeting at 14h30  or 15h00🤔
2021/03/29, 14:01 - +268 7944 7843: thank you
2021/03/29, 14:25 - +27 72 101 9695: @26879447843 @27636961730 please send your email address that you used for registering for taiga
2021/03/29, 14:25 - +27 72 101 9695: id like to add you to the team
2021/03/29, 14:26 - +27 72 101 9695: wait not @26879447843 , @27648238569
2021/03/29, 14:34 - +27 64 823 8569: Email address: 2181532@students.wits.ac.za
2021/03/29, 14:44 - ZEE STEENEVELDT: 2090475@students.wits.ac.za
2021/03/31, 13:39 - Nabeel: Our meeting is at 4 right?
2021/03/31, 13:49 - +27 72 101 9695: Yup
2021/03/31, 16:40 - +27 74 760 1963: I was confused for a bit but it's clear now. So the bot will run on Discord itself right? Because I'm looking at a video here and Discord allows You to add Your own bots
2021/03/31, 16:41 - +27 72 101 9695: could you send the vidoe
2021/03/31, 16:41 - +27 72 101 9695: viddeo link?
2021/03/31, 16:41 - +27 74 760 1963: He is python here by the way
2021/03/31, 16:42 - +27 74 760 1963: https://youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok
2021/03/31, 16:45 - +27 74 760 1963: So far it's helpful though.
2021/03/31, 16:45 - +27 74 760 1963: Bot permissions are built in, like Managing roles and so on
2021/03/31, 16:46 - Matthew: https://youtu.be/j_sD9udZnCk
2021/03/31, 16:46 - +27 72 101 9695: <Media omitted>
2021/03/31, 16:47 - +27 74 760 1963: 🤣 🤣 We are probably going to use it
2021/03/31, 16:48 - +268 7944 7843: It seems we're at an impasse coz the one I saw says the most popular is  discord.js 🙆🏾‍♂️😂
2021/03/31, 16:48 - +268 7944 7843: So which one do we use?
2021/03/31, 16:49 - +27 74 760 1963: I think we will see which has most resources
2021/03/31, 16:49 - +27 74 760 1963: The more resources, the better we will be able to code.
2021/03/31, 16:49 - +27 74 760 1963: Are we supposed to code from scratch or can we use libraries, like Discord.js?
2021/03/31, 16:50 - +27 74 760 1963: Python has Discord.py too 😂
2021/03/31, 16:52 - +268 7944 7843: Since we'll need to use it with node.js at some point, so maybe discord.js will be better?
2021/03/31, 23:11 - +27 72 101 9695: Hey guys.. I have no lights again tonight and my battery is about to die. Could you guys let the tutor know tomorrow if I'm not there and fill me in after 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021/03/31, 23:22 - Nabeel: Same boat but I think I should be able to make. I'll tell him
2021/04/01, 08:10 - Nabeel: 9 minutes man? 9 minutes ffs
2021/04/01, 08:10 - Matthew: 😴😴😴
2021/04/01, 08:10 - Nabeel: I could've been sleeping
2021/04/01, 08:11 - +27 64 823 8569: 😭😭 Same
2021/04/01, 08:12 - Matthew: We need to decide on a language, I personally don't mind so I am putting my vote down for Python
2021/04/01, 08:13 - Nabeel: Second for Python
2021/04/01, 08:14 - +27 84 485 6965: Me too
2021/04/01, 08:14 - +27 74 760 1963: Me too
2021/04/01, 08:14 - ZEE STEENEVELDT: Are we going to be using node.js?
2021/04/01, 08:15 - +27 84 485 6965: Can we have like a meeting later ... when everyone's available... just to decide what everyone should do for the first sprint ?
2021/04/01, 08:16 - +27 74 760 1963: I think so too
2021/04/01, 08:21 - Nabeel: Can everyone just think of available tasks that needs to be done in th meantime? And message on the group as you come up with some.
2021/04/01, 08:31 - Nabeel: 0. Pick a language
- 4 for python so far

1. Create Discord API account.
- suggest making a separate group email address to use so everyone will be able to have access

2. Use Case diagrams.
-discuss details on how it's gonna be designed

3. Update Taiga, GitHub, implement Coveralls and the other one.

4. Create git branch for starting the discord bot
-feature: monitoring messages and being summoned and replying to messages. (Call branch fundamentals?.)

5. Code Feature.
2021/04/01, 08:32 - Nabeel: This is what I got so far, please add on
2021/04/01, 08:34 - +27 84 485 6965: 6. Update outline for wiki
2021/04/01, 12:53 - +27 72 101 9695: Hey guys...
2021/04/01, 12:53 - +27 72 101 9695: I still don't have electricity by me😂🙈...
2021/04/01, 12:54 - +27 72 101 9695: I think we should probably code the bot in python because even if we need to use nodejs for the dashboard at a point there is ways to stream the data
2021/04/01, 12:55 - +27 72 101 9695: And about making a discord API account, I will do that now with a seperate email address and send through the details
2021/04/01, 12:56 - +27 74 760 1963: I'm cool with Python
2021/04/01, 12:56 - +27 74 760 1963: Ok mate, we will be waiting for those
2021/04/01, 12:57 - Nabeel: Can we put "deciding a language" as a completed task? 😂 Like does that count
2021/04/01, 12:58 - +27 74 760 1963: @26879447843 are You cool with the language decision? I know You were rooting for JS.
2021/04/01, 12:58 - +268 7944 7843: Yeah... python it is
2021/04/01, 12:59 - +268 7944 7843: Definitely a PBI 😂
2021/04/01, 12:59 - +27 74 760 1963: Now You can 😂

2021/04/01, 13:17 - +27 74 760 1963: We are here to help though. If there's something You don't get, shout in the group. It's not Your responsibility alone
2021/04/01, 13:17 - +27 72 101 9695: in like the team chat or something?

2021/04/01, 13:23 - Nabeel: Okay I sent it.
2021/04/01, 13:23 - Nabeel: I think you need to pin it
2021/04/01, 13:24 - Nabeel: Wait should I have sent in the team chat instead?
2021/04/01, 13:24 - +27 72 101 9695: its all good
2021/04/01, 14:17 - +27 74 760 1963: You guys done with CGV lab 2?

2021/04/01, 16:32 - +27 74 760 1963: Guys,when can we meet? So we create the bot. I think to the list of tasks you can add "Choosing bot permissions"

2021/04/01, 23:24 - +27 84 485 6965: https://youtu.be/SPTfmiYiuok
2021/04/01, 23:24 - +27 84 485 6965: Found this video this guy shows how to create a discord bot he uses repl.it an online ide to code it has a database system with it as well he also shows how to like use that and stuff u guys can check it out ✨
2021/04/01, 23:24 - +27 72 101 9695: Thank you 💃🏼
2021/04/01, 23:25 - +268 7944 7843: Thanks
2021/04/01, 23:25 - +27 84 485 6965: Only problem is I'm not sure how much storage repl.it allows us to use for free
2021/04/01, 23:25 - +27 84 485 6965: https://youtu.be/nW8c7vT6Hl4
2021/04/01, 23:26 - +27 74 760 1963: Saw this yesterday, he's really good
2021/04/01, 23:26 - +268 7944 7843: Still working on it... cant draw the heart though 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
2021/04/01, 23:28 - +27 74 760 1963: 🤣 You're only left with that part?
2021/04/01, 23:29 - +268 7944 7843: I've skipped it, doing the second question now 😂
2021/04/02, 00:26 - +27 84 485 6965: Hi guys ... so I  followed the bot tutorial it was pretty easy I got an example bot set up and responding we can just add a bit more code for responses and stuff and we'll have met the 1st sprint requirement of praveshs
2021/04/02, 00:27 - +27 74 760 1963: Awesome
2021/04/02, 12:24 - +268 7944 7843: Did you do it in replit or in your pc?
2021/04/02, 12:47 - +27 84 485 6965: Replit
2021/04/02, 12:48 - +27 84 485 6965: I was just struggling to get it to run continuously just have to fix that
2021/04/02, 13:08 - Nabeel: Maybe just put it in a 
while True:
2021/04/02, 13:34 - +27 74 760 1963: It only works with one message or?
2021/04/02, 13:53 - +27 84 485 6965: What do u mean ??
2021/04/02, 13:55 - +27 74 760 1963: Does it only respond to a single message when You send? I want to understand what context You mean when You say it does not run continuously
2021/04/02, 13:56 - +27 84 485 6965: Yea it only responds to one message for now
2021/04/02, 13:58 - +27 84 485 6965: So what I mean is if I stop running the program then the bot goes offline right and once u close replit it closes the program and stops running so I have to connect it to a webserver so it continues running even when I exit replit and pings the bot so it doesn't go to sleep and stop running
2021/04/02, 13:58 - +27 74 760 1963: I get it now
2021/04/02, 13:58 - +27 84 485 6965: 👍🏼👍🏼
2021/04/02, 14:13 - Nabeel: Yeah I guess we'd use the wits lamp server to run it.
2021/04/02, 14:16 - +27 84 485 6965: Yea I actually forgot about that  I'll go try it out
2021/04/02, 18:44 - +27 72 101 9695: hey guys... heres a really awesome playlist on building a discord bot in python... it helps with setup and everything and is really informative.
2021/04/02, 18:44 - +27 72 101 9695: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3GfRiBCHOhfVoiDZpSz8SM_HybXRPzZ
2021/04/02, 19:40 - +27 84 485 6965: Thanks ✨
2021/04/02, 21:46 - +27 84 485 6965: Hi ... could u guys make a list of possible commands for the bot to respond to when requested ??
2021/04/02, 21:46 - +27 84 485 6965: U have a few general one so like 1. Lab times
2. Lecturer email addresses 
3. Tut times
2021/04/02, 21:47 - +27 84 485 6965: It's general questions the bot can easily answer
2021/04/02, 22:00 - +27 72 101 9695: Off the top of my head 
Test dates
Lecture email addresses 
Weights of assessments
2021/04/04, 00:44 - Nabeel: https://github.com/Discord-Botify/project-diagrams
2021/04/04, 00:45 - Nabeel: I feel like this will come in very useful eventually
2021/04/04, 01:36 - Nabeel: @27721019695 idk if you made the repo on GitHub already but there is a option on main page called "Working with a team" maybe give that a try. If you already made one it's chilled.
2021/04/04, 12:40 - +27 74 760 1963: @27721019695 the invitations aren't working
2021/04/04, 12:42 - +27 72 101 9695: 🙈😭
2021/04/04, 12:42 - Nabeel: Did you sign in to GitHub?

2021/04/04, 12:54 - Nabeel: Please remind me, we need to ask Michael where/how do we store our API keys for our bot. Cause store them as strings on GitHub
2021/04/04, 12:57 - Nabeel: * Cause we can't store them (I'm tired ) 😂
2021/04/04, 12:57 - +27 74 760 1963: When are we having our meeting as a group to discuss going further? 1st Sprint is due I think the 12th
2021/04/04, 12:58 - Nabeel: Do you guys wanna meet up Tuesday 1pm? So just before our tuts
2021/04/04, 12:59 - +27 74 760 1963: How about tomorrow? Too short notice
2021/04/04, 12:59 - +27 74 760 1963: *?

2021/04/04, 12:59 - Nabeel: Let's see what the rest say
2021/04/04, 13:00 - +27 74 760 1963: No problem
2021/04/04, 13:01 - +27 72 101 9695: evening tomorrow is good with me

2021/04/04, 13:05 - +27 72 101 9695: lets say at about 6ish?
2021/04/04, 13:05 - +27 72 101 9695: i can do earlier or later.. up to you guys
2021/04/04, 13:08 - +27 74 760 1963: No problem
2021/04/04, 13:18 - Nabeel: Can I just confirm with you the time tomorrow? Maybe we can have it earlier like 4pm but again I'm not sure lol.
2021/04/04, 13:26 - +27 84 485 6965: Unsure if I can make it tomorrow but I shall try
2021/04/04, 13:27 - +27 72 101 9695: 4 is also good with me
2021/04/04, 14:45 - ZEE STEENEVELDT: I think 6ish works for me
2021/04/04, 19:38 - +27 84 485 6965: For the bot on discord what did you use to have it connected 24/7 ??
2021/04/04, 19:38 - +27 72 101 9695: I just have the python script running constantly on my machine 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021/04/04, 19:39 - +27 84 485 6965: Ahh ohks
2021/04/04, 20:02 - +27 74 760 1963: To run it constantly, we need a website to host it right?
2021/04/04, 20:03 - +27 72 101 9695: Not really
2021/04/04, 20:04 - +27 72 101 9695: The bot is basically just a python application
2021/04/04, 20:04 - +27 72 101 9695: So if we can have it running on lamp or anything that's connected to the internet
2021/04/04, 20:04 - +27 72 101 9695: It will run
2021/04/04, 20:04 - +27 74 760 1963: Ok bro
2021/04/04, 20:04 - +27 72 101 9695: Even a raspberry pie would work
2021/04/05, 14:20 - Nabeel: So 6pm tonight?
2021/04/05, 14:21 - +27 74 760 1963: I'm good with that
2021/04/05, 14:23 - +27 72 101 9695: No problem on my side
2021/04/05, 14:23 - +268 7944 7843: Sounds alright
2021/04/05, 14:42 - Nabeel: If anyone can't make it, please tell us
2021/04/05, 14:46 - +27 84 485 6965: 👍🏼👍🏼
2021/04/05, 14:47 - +27 74 760 1963: @27648238569, @27617969073, @27636961730 are You alright with the meeting time?
2021/04/05, 14:48 - Matthew: Yeah that is good
2021/04/05, 15:07 - +27 64 823 8569: I'm fine with it
2021/04/05, 16:51 - ZEE STEENEVELDT: I’m good
2021/04/05, 18:54 - Nabeel: Would you say that the bot is an actor and discord itself is a system or is the bot a system on its own?
2021/04/05, 18:55 - +27 74 760 1963: I think the bot is an actor and Discord is the system
2021/04/05, 19:33 - Nabeel: <Media omitted>
2021/04/06, 14:08 - +27 74 760 1963: We have tuts right
2021/04/06, 14:08 - +27 84 485 6965: Yea
2021/04/06, 21:48 - Nabeel: Luqmaan can you please just add the repository to Travis Ci and I'll see if I can make sense of it.
2021/04/06, 21:48 - Nabeel: I think you're the only one who can add it. But everyone can use it afterwards
2021/04/06, 22:05 - +27 72 101 9695: Okay will try (most likely tomorrow
2021/04/07, 08:01 - Matthew: We have a meeting now if anyone is awake
2021/04/07, 08:01 - Matthew: 😂
2021/04/07, 08:01 - +27 74 760 1963: 🤣 🤣 Just woke up
2021/04/07, 08:22 - Matthew: Hey guys does anyone need help with anything?
2021/04/07, 08:24 - Nabeel: I just completed the use case diagram, so I'm good for now. Anyone else?
2021/04/07, 08:24 - +27 84 485 6965: Getting started on the wiki today will send through when Done
2021/04/07, 08:25 - +27 74 760 1963: I'm planning to take a look at Travis CI today
2021/04/07, 08:27 - Nabeel: I'll send the diagram on discord and here.
2021/04/07, 08:27 - Nabeel: <Media omitted>
2021/04/07, 09:12 - +27 84 485 6965: what other requirements for the discord bot do we need I just have python and webserver rn
2021/04/07, 09:56 - +27 84 485 6965: On git it only allows me to post urls for images not the actual image
2021/04/07, 09:57 - +27 84 485 6965: U did it using like an application right ? ... can u sent me the link for that instead
2021/04/07, 10:05 - +27 84 485 6965: Guys when u have time can u just take a look at the wiki I have on taiga and github
2021/04/07, 10:05 - +27 84 485 6965: There isn't much and I didn't really know what to add if u have any suggestions on what to add just let me know
2021/04/07, 10:07 - +27 84 485 6965: Also on github should I add a bot set up guide (just like the set up of ut on discord) or not because I did add links to the documentation u use and the developer portal
2021/04/07, 10:08 - Nabeel: Do you want the pdf version?
2021/04/07, 10:09 - Nabeel: ,https://lucid.app/lucidchart/invitations/accept/7ef41255-2aff-449e-ac0d-daeab8d4737b
2021/04/07, 10:10 - Nabeel: I have no idea about the rest tbh but I'll have a look at it a bit later
2021/04/07, 10:13 - +27 84 485 6965: No its okay
2021/04/07, 10:13 - +27 74 760 1963: Which email was used to create the gitbub account?
2021/04/07, 10:22 - +268 7944 7843: Shouldn't the requirements state the capabilities of the bot? 

Or maybe I'm just mixing things up
2021/04/07, 10:24 - +27 74 760 1963: Have we been given admin rights on gitbub? Travis CI doesn't see any repository I have access to
2021/04/07, 10:41 - +27 74 760 1963: Ok, the project from gitbub appears on my Travis CI account. Now I'm figuring out how to add the ".yml" file so Travis CI can read the code and stuff
2021/04/07, 10:41 - +27 74 760 1963: @27721019695, please commit the code for the bot
2021/04/07, 10:42 - +27 72 101 9695: Okay
2021/04/07, 10:42 - +27 72 101 9695: Did anything happen in the meeting this morning 🙈😂
2021/04/07, 10:48 - +27 72 101 9695: Code is on GitHub
2021/04/07, 10:49 - +27 74 760 1963: Awesome
2021/04/07, 11:02 - +27 84 485 6965: I dont think so I'm pretty sure it's what extra stuff u need for the bot to work
2021/04/07, 11:06 - +27 84 485 6965: Not really he just went through the wiki briefly and then he went through the rubric that was basically it
2021/04/07, 11:07 - +27 84 485 6965: He said u can dm him if u need help with the Travis ci and code cov stuff
2021/04/07, 11:45 - +27 74 760 1963: Hey guys, build is failing on Travis CI because we got no test files
2021/04/07, 11:55 - +27 74 760 1963: Travis CI works guys
2021/04/07, 11:56 - +27 74 760 1963: I created a python test file and the build passes
2021/04/07, 11:56 - +27 74 760 1963: I'm just not sure if it runs for everyone so could someone try to edit the python test file and change it and see if Travis CI works on their side
2021/04/07, 23:52 - Nabeel: I still don't have access to Travis Ci lmao. How did you get it working?
2021/04/07, 23:53 - +27 74 760 1963: Sign in with a Github on the Travis CI website, then give it access to Your repositories
2021/04/07, 23:55 - +27 74 760 1963: *account
2021/04/07, 23:55 - Nabeel: I did that
2021/04/07, 23:55 - Nabeel: <Media omitted>
2021/04/07, 23:58 - +27 74 760 1963: See if You enabled BlackBox in Your repositories in settings on Github
2021/04/08, 00:00 - Nabeel: Okay I think it's working. I had to use travis-ci.com and not .org
2021/04/08, 00:39 - Nabeel: <Media omitted>
2021/04/08, 01:02 - Nabeel: https://towardsdatascience.com/using-dotenv-to-hide-sensitive-information-in-python-77ab9dfdaac8
2021/04/08, 01:59 - Nabeel: Okay, I created a branch and I  made a cog with some basic functions.
2021/04/08, 02:01 - Nabeel: Everything is working with my bot but I need to test on ours but I can't log in to discord developers because of 2FA. We need a new token.
2021/04/08, 02:01 - Nabeel: Can we have a quick meeting tomorrow to show you guys what I did? It shouldn't take long
2021/04/08, 02:02 - +27 84 485 6965: Sure 👍🏼👍🏼 just confirm a time
2021/04/08, 02:03 - +268 7944 7843: Cool
2021/04/08, 02:04 - +27 72 101 9695: Sure
2021/04/08, 02:04 - Nabeel: What time is good with you guys?
2021/04/08, 02:04 - +27 72 101 9695: Half past 10?
2021/04/08, 02:05 - Nabeel: I was thinking more in the afternoon, but if I must we can 😂
2021/04/08, 02:05 - +27 72 101 9695: Okay no afternoon is better
2021/04/08, 02:05 - +27 72 101 9695: Let's do that
2021/04/08, 02:05 - +27 72 101 9695: Sleep is better
2021/04/08, 02:06 - +268 7944 7843: Yeah afternoon or evening
2021/04/08, 02:07 - Nabeel: Thank you! 😂 Okay we just need to see when the others are available
2021/04/08, 02:08 - +27 72 101 9695: I also adjusted the code and added cogs... But I didn't commit it yet.. I want to try and implement the direct message replies first
2021/04/08, 02:16 - Nabeel: Okay cool so we can go through it all tomorrow then
2021/04/08, 02:17 - Nabeel: Hey can you turn off 2FA on discord because I couldn't login 😂 they were asking for some code
2021/04/08, 02:17 - +27 72 101 9695: I can't turn off 2fa
2021/04/08, 02:18 - +27 72 101 9695: You have to have it on to have a developer account
2021/04/08, 02:18 - +27 72 101 9695: <Media omitted>
2021/04/08, 02:18 - +27 72 101 9695: Download google authenticator
2021/04/08, 02:18 - Nabeel: Oh damn, makes sense. Okay before you commit, just make sure you don't have a the token visible because they'll disable it again
2021/04/08, 02:19 - +27 72 101 9695: Then you gotta sign in with the Blackbox email
2021/04/08, 02:19 - +27 72 101 9695: Whenever they ask for 2fa code go to that app and use that code
2021/04/08, 02:19 - +27 72 101 9695: These are just backups
2021/04/08, 02:20 - +27 72 101 9695: I'll speak to you about hiding the token tomorrow
2021/04/08, 02:20 - +27 72 101 9695: Before I commit
2021/04/08, 02:20 - Nabeel: Okay cool. Thanks
2021/04/08, 14:43 - +27 72 101 9695: Hey guys what time this afternoon?

2021/04/08, 14:44 - +27 74 760 1963: Is it possible to make it in the evening, say 18:00? I'm not home currently. I'm out and about
2021/04/08, 14:51 - +27 72 101 9695: Fine with me
2021/04/08, 14:52 - Nabeel: Can we make it 18:15 then?
2021/04/08, 15:05 - Matthew: When y'all said tomorrow at 2 am I thought you meant tomorrow 😂😴 but that time is good for me
2021/04/08, 15:28 - +27 84 485 6965: I'm good with that 👍🏼
2021/04/08, 15:32 - +27 64 823 8569: I'm fine with that
2021/04/09, 00:51 - +27 74 760 1963: Hey guys, I missed the meeting. Any updates?
2021/04/09, 20:18 - Nabeel: Is anyone currently running the bot on our server also?
2021/04/09, 23:51 - Nabeel: Can you guys please stop running the bot on our server for now.
2021/04/09, 23:51 - +27 72 101 9695: Who is running it 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021/04/09, 23:52 - Nabeel: I have no idea. Like rn its online and I'm not running it
2021/04/10, 12:01 - Nabeel: Aight guys, I got Travis Ci up and running fine but I'm having trouble with Coveralls.
2021/04/10, 12:02 - Nabeel: I can post coverage from my terminal on my PC fine, and I get like 78% but it just doesn't want to work from coveralls
2021/04/10, 12:02 - +27 74 760 1963: Wasn't it already working?
2021/04/10, 12:04 - Nabeel: Yeah with a fake test case 😂 I mean were not gonna test if 5+1 =6
2021/04/10, 12:05 - +27 74 760 1963: 🤣 Fair enough
2021/04/10, 12:05 - Nabeel: It's working with the test cases on our discord server now
2021/04/10, 12:05 - +27 74 760 1963: Awesome bro
2021/04/10, 12:05 - Nabeel: *Doesn't want to work from travis

2021/04/10, 21:55 - +268 7944 7843: Sounds good
2021/04/10, 22:17 - Nabeel: I changed the installation guide on the wiki a little. Just check if it's fine. And I think we need to add it to Taiga
2021/04/10, 22:27 - +27 84 485 6965: I shall add it on Monday to taiga
2021/04/10, 22:33 - Nabeel: Okay, Michael said he's marking on Monday so maybe do it tomorrow?
