14/11/18, 14:57 - Abhijit A M: this will be during exam. these students will get extra time for exam. Schedule will be announced later.
14/11/18, 16:27 - Abhijit A M: Pleease note that I'll be checking code done only upto Monday. Those who submitted on Tuesday should not be under the impression that for 2 marks you will get one extra day of work. The 2 marks will be deducted purely for late submission.
15/11/18, 09:32 - Abhijit A M: Dear Students,

At least 6 students have been found so far (out of only 60 so far!) doing cheating in the project. They have either taken code from web or from seniors or from each other. Incomplete submissions, segfaulting code are acecptable but cheating is not acceptable. 

I have code of all your seniors with me and every project will be checked for plagiarism against the seniors code as well.

Here is a choice. You can declare that you took code from seniors/other-places and receive a zero in the project. If you don't declare and I find it, then it will invite more serious penalty. All such declarations have to be made by sending an email to me mentioning your name, MIS and accepting your mistake.

16/11/18, 09:12 - Abhijit A M: Students: Please note that the dsa project checking is NOT a viva. Your marks will be solely based on the code and not on what you speak.  So  no need to panic in talking to me (and no need to talk extra in the hope of getting more marks). The in person checking is only to get additional inputs from you in checking the code.

27/11/18, 15:05 - Abhijit A M: What is "copy" and why is it bad? 

Copy is the way we learn. Almost everything we know is through copy. Unfortunately in a competitive environment (the prime factor to be blamed), when students have to compete with each other, copying from each other is not allowed, not because it is detrimental to learning, but because on one hand the work done by you becomes your own property, and on the other hand sharing it with others goes against the rule of competition. When everyone has to be evaluated for his/her "own" performance, copying has to be disallowed. 

Leaving that apart, the reality is -  in a system of competition, "copy" is not allowed in exams, projects. etc.

W.r.t. the DSA project, if the CODE that you have submitted, is not entirely product of your own thinking (the algorithmic part can be removed from this as many existing algorithms like compression, etc. need to be learnt - copied conceptually - from other resources), then it's a copy.  This includes copying part/complete code from web/seniors; design of the code done by others, part of code written by relatives, etc.
27/11/18, 15:27 - Mayank Jain: Sorry for being unavailable today for PEV journal assessments. I had come out of college for some work and got late. Those whose journals are to be checked and those who have to collect it can come tomorrow on Wednesday, or Thursday and Friday anytime between 2 to 5pm

01/01/19, 19:39 - Abhijit A M: Dear All,

Please find attached the class-wise timetable for Even Sem of 2018-19. This timetable is applicable for current week. Few changes will be done considering requirements for rooms/labs by other depts, etc, mistakes if any, requirements from faculty/students, and updated version will be sent for next week.

Please note the following about batches of each class.
SYCE and SYIT
S1, S2, S3, S4 and DSY batches for core subjects.
M1, M2, M3 batches will be formed by VCPDE teacher for VCPDE Tutorial.
M1 + M+ M3 batches = all students except DSY (non-DSY batch)

TYCE and TYIT
Elective batches are different from core batches. Core course batches are: T1, T2, T3, T4, T5.

Elective batches are named as follows (one example given): 
TYCE-WST: All TYCE students in WST
TYIT-WST : All TYIT students in WST

If the course has more than on batch, then they are numbered like this, for example for GM lab: TYCE-GM1 TYCE-GM2 TYIT-GM1 TYIT-GM2 TYIT-GM3. These batches of equal size will be formed by respective course faculty with the faculty adviser.

For Advanced Microprocessors and Finance courses, the CE and IT batches are combined for labs and theory both, as both CE and IT batches are very small. Minor course timing is Mon-Wed 5-6pm.


BTECH CE and IT
There are two electives and one core course lab. The batches for DE4 are used for core course as well, hence the core course lab schedule lists the batch names from DE4. The batches for DE5 are separate.

DE4 batches are named as, for example, for Computer Forensics and Data Recovery course: BTCE-CFDR1 BTIT-CFDR1 BTCE-CFDR2  BTIT-CFDR2, etc.  The BTCE-CFDR is all students of BTCE for CFDR.

Since there are 30 students for BTCE-CFDR, the batch BTCE-CFDR1 will be of size 20, and BTCE-CFDR2 will be of size 10. The BTCE-CFDR2 will be combined with IT batch BTIT-CFDR2 for labs. The students in each batch will be announced by the respective faculty advisers and the course faculty. 


Minor course timing is Mon-Wed 5-6pm.

*About the film*
The film that introduced the genius of Satyajit Ray to the world, Pather Panchali, meaning "Song of the road", is widely regarded as a masterpiece. Story of a young kid Apu, his sister Durga, their family and their lives in rural village of Bengal, the 'Pather Panchali' is an immersive cinematic experience, inspired by Italian neorealism. 

*Opinions of some critics* 
Akira Kurosawa: "overwhelming", able "to stir up deep passions"
Lindsay Anderson at Cannes: "the quality of ultimate unforgettable experience"
Times of India: " "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema ... Pather Panchali is pure cinema"."
Arturo Lanocita: "the magic horse of poetry ... invading the screen"
Basil Wright: "a new and incontrovertible work of art"

*सिनेमाबद्दल* 
या सिनेमाने सत्यजित रेंच्या प्रतिभेची जगाला ओळख करून दिली. 'पथेर पांचाली', म्हणजे 'सडकेचे गाणं' या सिनेमाला जगभरातील सिने तज्ञ आणि सिने प्रेमी एक अत्युकृष्ठ कलाकृती मानतात. अपु हा लहान मुलगा, त्याची बहिण दुर्गा, त्यांचे कुटुंब आणि एका दुरस्थ बंगाली खेड्यातील त्यांचे जीवन यांचे चित्रण करणारा 'पथेर पांचाली' हा सिनेमा, इटालियन नव-वास्तववादापासुन प्रेरित, एक बुडवून टाकणारा सिने-अनुभव आहे.  

*सिनेमाबद्दल काही तज्ञांची मतं*
अकिरो कुरोसावा: "अचंबित करणारा", "अतिशय गहन भावनांना हात घालणारा"
लिंडसे ऍंडरसन: "न विसरता येणाऱ्या अनुभवाच्या दर्जाचा"
टाईम्स ऑफ इंडिया: "याची तुलना इतर कोणत्याही भारतीय सिनेमाशी करणे शक्य नाही ...पथेर पांचाली शुद्ध सिनेमा आहे."
अर्थुरो लोनासिटा: "कवितेचा जादूई अश्व ...पडद्याला व्यापून टाकतो"
बसिल व्राईट: "नवीन आणि वादातीत कलाकृती"

*Opinions of some critics* 
Murtaza Ali Khan : 
The movie fulfils in its absolute sense the real purpose of cinema: to entertain and educate, simultaneously. Pyaasa's intense and thought-provoking plot emphasises upon the fact that every human being, howsoever wretched or deplorable, is capable of love and worthy of being loved.
Devang Pathak:
It explores the dangers of a commercial, selfishly fickle world which patronises and abandons art as a trend.

Greetings from *COEP FOSSMeet* team!!
With FOSSMeet being just one week away (30th and 31st March), we were thinking to create more awareness about the technologies that are going to be addressed this year in FOSSMeet.

Greetings from COEP FOSSMeet team!
*COEP FOSSMeet '19 is going to be held on 30th and 31st March, 2019 and it is absolutely free for COEPians.* We have observed that many students in our college do not know what exactly a FOSSMeet is and about FOSS in general. So, to create awareness about these topics, *Abhijit sir will be conducting an Introductory session about COEP FOSSMeet '19 on 26th March (Tuesday).*
Time : *6 pm to 6:30 pm*
Venue : *Mini Audi*
*We suggest that everyone who has an urge to know more about FOSS and what to expect this year in FOSSMeet should definitely attend the session.*

*1) The Story of Linux*
“Linux is a story of Unix told by Linus Torvalds” If you really want to love Operating System then you have to understand first the history of it. Who Implemented it? In what circumstances? What was the motive? Who are these guys? Why did they take so much of pain to make OS? What is the relation between Linux & Unix? Is Unix there in Linux? Why did they choose the ‘C’ language? What is kernel? What is shell? Why not assembly?

Ek Ruka Hua Faisla", a story of 12 jurors trying to decide the guilt of a young boy accused of murdering his own father, is a Hindi remake of the famous Golden Globe winning Film *"12 Angry Men"*. A breathtaking drama, the film is not only about critical inquiry, procedures of law, principles of jurisprudence and human values on liberty and death, but also a poignant portrayal of class, caste, racial biases the pervade everyday human life and make people judge one another.

Stanley Kubrick's
👉 *Spartacus (1960)*

Duration 190 minutes

Hindi Audio
English Subtitles

*Note*: The film starts at 5pm

Winner of 4 Academy awards and the highest grossing film of Hollywood till 1970, Stanely Kubrick's 'Spartacus', based on the novel 'Spartacus' written by Howard Fast is the story of that glorious struggle which inspired numerous struggles against slavery and injustice in America, Europe and all over the world. Spartacus, a gladiator (slave fighers used for 'entertainment'), lead the most famous revolt of slaves against slavery and shacked the foundations of the slavery system. The film is based on the novel by Howard Fast which he self-published, with the help of people's contributions, after a wave of repression by US government.  This film, considered to be one of the best of world cinema, not only brings forth the brave fight waged by Spartacus and his fellow slave-soldiers, but also unearths the contradictions inherent in the slavery system, and structural societal changes that this revolt gave impetus to.

In today's competitive world, we all wish to be one step ahead of others. We all want to be shown direction  and minimize the chances of failure. 
To do that, we at SDS believe it's essential that we learn from the experience of others. 

Therefore few of the founding alumni of SDS, some of who are currently pursuing their Masters while some are working in the industry, will be conducting an interactive session.

They would like to share their experiences and interact with us.
Some of the topics that they will touch upon are: 

*1. Masters/ internship in the USA:*
     • GRE prep
     • Profile building
     • How to apply
     • Course selection 

*2. Placements*
     • Preparation for internship/                    placements
     • Off-campus placements
     • Work culture in companies

*Date: 16th August, 2019*
*Venue:* *AC 201*
*Time:* *6pm*

We cordially invite you to attend this interactive session and look forward to seeing you there.

Regards,
SDS Team

21/05/20, 23:02 - Manas Joshi COEP: Submission extended till May 24th
22/05/20, 12:33 - Yash Agarwal: Dear Yash,

As per the revised academic plan, your end semester evaluations are very light. Also the internship opportunity you received is virtual. You are very lucky to receive such an opportunity, which is denied to almost 90% of COEP students consideing altogether. For your better future career, a little more hardship to be done this time considering the current covid situation and request you to cope up with both.

Regards
