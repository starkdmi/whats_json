3/5/20, 8:53 AM - +91 6280 909 393: Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Zanjan University
  Corona virus arrives in any country, sooner or later there is no doubt that many countries have no diagnostic sets or equipment, so
  Please use as much as possible of natural vitamin C to strengthen your immune system.
  Don't worry, C gets rid of it a lot, and it's fine.
  
    The virus currently contains no vaccine and no specific treatment
  Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous
  This disease appears to be caused by gene fusion in a snake and bat, and it has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.

It is important to keep the message on your greatest knowledge: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Slices of lemon in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life."  *
   Even if you work, you should take a look at this message and pass it on to others! The lemon cut into three parts and put in a cup, then pour hot water and turn it into (alkaline water), 
  After reading, talk to someone else and transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
  Council:
  Professor Chen Horin notes that anyone who receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life...
  I have done my job and I hope you can help me develop it as well.
 They published it in academic groups.

5/28/20, 1:36 PM - +91 6239 529 650: 1. Why should I pay for an online training when there are so many FREE online resource?

It is very structured – The problem with the free resources is that there are far too many of them making it difficult for you to know where to start from. Often students start enthusiastically but give up mid-way because it becomes all too confusing. Internshala Trainings, on the other hand, handholds you in this initial and crucial phase and guide you step by step till the time you become confident and knowledgeable enough to learn on your own.
It is practice-oriented – Learning by doing is at the heart of Internshala Trainings’ philosophy and every training comes with a lot of exercises & practicals along the way. You also work on a project in parallel where you make something from scratch (could be an app, a website, an IoT device, a digital marketing campaign etc.) applying the concepts that you just learned online. This makes sure that you understand the practical aspects of the subject.
Great support –  The most frustrating part of learning anything new is getting stuck at some point and spending hours looking for the right answer on the web. Internshala Trainings provide you with expert live chat support and access to a Q&A forum where you can clear your doubts in a jiffy and move ahead
5/28/20, 1:36 PM - +91 6239 529 650: Few more pointers - 

1. The teachers of all the trainings have years of experience. The content quality is extremely refined and useful.
All the trainings are made by professionals 

2. Through Internshala Trainings students can also test their knowledge through quizzes, module tests and exams. They can also get hands on practice by doing projects

3. Proper support system 
Students can post your doubts on the Q&A forum which will be answered by the teachers within 24 hou

6. Access to free placement preparation training which will help students to prepare for the job interviews  

Also, you might be aware at most all big brands, startups, prestigious institutions hire interns through Internshala. Every HR of a company knows about Internshala. Having an Internshala Training Certificate on your resume would be a highlight. 

Students must not compromise on their future by choosing a free training.  
Internshala Trainings gives you a 5 star learning experience at a very affordable price

1.additional charges ki meeting kal hai
2.hostel fee .. 6000 ho gyi hai ... 
3.tution fee ka pakka nhi hai kuch but they will give our msg to authority  
thats it
8/12/20, 1:51 PM - +91 6280 909 393: According to me,poore tution charges lenge,baaki jo additional campus charges hai usme kuch relief mil Sakta hai
8/12/20, 1:52 PM - Bhavleen Nit: i respect your view .. point ... but decided nhi hai ye .. abhi 😊
8/12/20, 1:53 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Baaki institutes  me yahi hua hai
8/12/20, 1:53 PM - +91 88472 12229: Aree confuse mat karo pehle hee bahut confuse hogaye hai sab 😅
8/12/20, 1:53 PM - Bhavleen Nit: 😊
8/12/20, 1:53 PM - Bhavleen Nit: jo go with .
Heena .. points 😊 no need to confuse yourself
8/12/20, 1:53 PM - Bhavleen Nit: 🙌🏻
8/12/20, 1:54 PM - +91 88472 12229: Heena dobara Sab kuch post karde in case somebody missed
8/12/20, 1:54 PM - +91 88472 12229: 😅
8/12/20, 1:54 PM - +91 6280 909 393: So here to clear your doubt
- tution fee jo k general air above 5 lakh income  walo k liye 62500 hai Uske related Abhi koi discussion nahi hua hai discussion nahi hua hai
8/12/20, 1:55 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Secondly 25500 jo hostlers institute Ko pay karte hai jisme room rent ,LAN, library,water and electricity bill aata hai uska bhi koi discussion nahi hua hai ,uska discussion kl hoga .
Aur day scholars k liye ye amount 17000 hai
8/12/20, 1:58 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Aur hostel amount hai 24500 jisme se 
-7000 workers ki salary hai aur 
-2500 utility charges jisme koi repairing ya utensils ka kharcha aata hai 
Aur baaki around 15000 jo k khane ka hamara mess advance hai 
- ab is total 24500 me se sirf 6000 Liya ja rha hai which includes both the salary of workers and utility charges.
8/12/20, 1:58 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Aur koi query ho to please feel free to contact me
8/12/20, 2:00 PM - +91 88472 12229: This message was deleted
8/12/20, 2:09 PM - +91 6280 909 393: One more thing
Girls,
Please don't pay any amount now .
Within a week gh me poora record mil jaayega kiska kitna refund hai vagerah vagerah,it usi me se 6000 cut kar k baaki return kar denge
8/12/20, 2:09 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Aur jinke paise 6000 se Kam hue vo baaki ka paisa bhar denge
8/12/20, 2:12 PM - +91 88472 12229: 1. The institutional fee of the hosteler can not be changed as it is in the hand of MHRD. 
But still one try has been told by our repective team of mess and hostel committees. But there are very less chances that the fee will be reduced of a hostler as it is not in the hand of wardens/chief wardens, it's in the hand of MHRD. 
It's not even in the hand of our director sir Or registerar sir. It's in the hand of board of governors.
8/12/20, 2:12 PM - +91 88472 12229: Note:- If you want to leave the hostel for this sem. (If somebody want) then you have to vacate the room and give an underaking that you will not apply for hostel further. (So, basically bhaiyo Institute se kuch kmm nhi ho skta jo unhone nikala hai)
8/12/20, 2:13 PM - +91 88472 12229: Basically kuch reduce nhi hoga and we just paid 6k extra
8/12/20, 2:14 PM - Bhavleen Nit: 🤣🤣🤣🤣koi positively dekh rha hai koi negatively
8/12/20, 2:25 PM - +91 6280 909 393: please is group me koi bhi is type ka discussion Mt karo
8/12/20, 2:25 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Yaha sirf officil message please
8/12/20, 2:25 PM - +91 6280 909 393: Doosre group me discussion karlo yaha sirf conclusion hona chahiye

8/13/20, 11:58 AM - +91 6280 909 393: We, a team of 5 UG students from IIT Delhi, have developed and launched a fully functional document scanning application called "ScanUp" on the Google Play Store for Android devices. The application works as an Indian alternative to applications such as CamScanner and Adobe Scan. We are also planning to launch the application for iOS in the coming weeks.

This application will also help students from our institute to scan answer sheets, as many of the online examinations require us to scan and mail our answers. We have added a Document detection Algorithm, Image Quality Improvement Filters, to PDF converter and easy share button. Also, we compress the images taken whilst maintaining their image quality, allowing users with poor internet connections to scan their answer sheets and be able to send in their Minor, Major answer scripts. We will keep updating the application with many more features to come.

Jo list bheji thi maine usmai jo bacho k the names uske sem 5 ki mess fee pending thi unhone bharni hai jo.
Baaki EVERYONE has to pay the mess fee for 6th SEM i.e. Rs. 5000. 
Uski receipt lekr jaani hai

10/14/21, 9:20 PM - Bhavleen Nit: sorry to msg here muskan I don't have authority to do so

lekin..
dekh humne jan-jul 2021i.e 4th sem ki fees bhari hai ab tak .

5th sem ke link nahi aaye hai .na koi mail aaya 
6th sem ki fees iss vaqt nhi bhari ja sakti kyonki vo iss sem ke result ke baad feedback bhar ke uske baad hi bharenge sab.

so for now 4th sem ki reciept leke jana . kyonki boys hostels bhi vhi leke ja rhe hain.
jab link aayega 5th ka tab ki tab dekhenge.
10/14/21, 9:24 PM - +91 81785 10488: I think you can do this.. and agar wo bole ki ek baar 5000 bharna hai on the spot ki uske bina nhi hoga allotment toh wo dekh lena tum.. make arrangements for that just in case

3/4/22, 12:08 PM - +91 6280 909 393: On the behalf of all the hostel inmates I Would like to convey that we all students are not willing to pay this amount as they feel that this amount is quite large as till the time we will come to hostel half of the semester would already be over.

Apart from that we have been paying the service charges all through the pandemic, and paid 5000 rs last semester as hostel seat booking charges. Although it was necessary to fill this charges so as to pay the mess workers in tough times, but this amount although small has put a lot pressure on our parents pocket, specially all those who lost their jobs .

We all students believe that we have co-operated with the institute authorities for payment of hostel workers and so we urge institute authorities to co-operate with us so that our parents won't feel much pressure in educating their children.

Moreover, there's one more thing I have observed that the hostel rent charges has increased drastically from 2018 batch to 2019 batch basically double of the amount, however there is no difference in the facilities we are getting. 

We have put all the major issues that we are facing. We all urge you to look into these issues concerning our welfare.

Firstly city jaane k liye ab koi parents ko call nhi karna padega, koi restrictions nhi hogi, their will be a pass, you just need to fill it and just tell the reason and you can go to City. But you need to come before 6:30. In case you go to your home they will call your parents just to inform them.
Second, the hostel gate timings are 10pm but we have tried to increase the timings to 11pm. All the three wardens of the hostel has agreed and the chief warden has also agreed. But we need to wait till 1st April as they are trying to get things to be normal again. Most probably it will be increased from 1st April.
