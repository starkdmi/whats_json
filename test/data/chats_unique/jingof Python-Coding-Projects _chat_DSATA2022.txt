[28/12/2021, 13:37:09] yussuf Paapy cmu: I looked at it
[28/12/2021, 13:37:25] yussuf Paapy cmu: But it’s something like u said 😂
[28/12/2021, 13:37:30] Tiano: were you able to think it all through?
[28/12/2021, 13:38:22] yussuf Paapy cmu: Yeap
[28/12/2021, 13:39:02] yussuf Paapy cmu: Not started its implementation though
[28/12/2021, 13:39:09] Tiano: i implemented the trie thing for the dictionary, but after that hehe

[28/12/2021, 13:45:10] yussuf Paapy cmu: We were living a soft life without knowing about it 😂

[28/12/2021, 13:57:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Ip Analyzer
[28/12/2021, 13:57:19] Tiano: this? nahhh
[28/12/2021, 13:57:20] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Where we have to use heap and hash table
[28/12/2021, 13:57:38] Tiano: if you guys had used the bit array class, everything was simple
[28/12/2021, 13:57:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: It was weeks after it that we covered the concept
[28/12/2021, 13:58:17] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Lol....I tried bit Array bro..but it was complicating my life
[28/12/2021, 13:58:42] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: But you also told me bit Array won't work
[28/12/2021, 13:58:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: But in the end we were okay
[28/12/2021, 14:01:15] yussuf Paapy cmu: Lol, wasn’t following covered concept, research mainly 🤝
[28/12/2021, 14:03:28] yussuf Paapy cmu: We had to look for trouble but in the end we were learning new things, and it all depends in the way the TA suggests at first place 😀
[28/12/2021, 14:06:46] Tiano: i could redo that assignment in 2 hours with BitArray and it will still work😂😂
[28/12/2021, 14:08:37] yussuf Paapy cmu: U know my life became easier after including bit arrays in my implementation

[28/12/2021, 14:35:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Trie Data structures is also called digital tree or prefix tree data structures ??
[28/12/2021, 14:36:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: The assignment 2 seem interesting thou is just the time and position it is coming
[28/12/2021, 14:36:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Maybe SP plan to introduce them to tree DS in the second class
[28/12/2021, 14:54:31] Tiano: yes exactly
[28/12/2021, 14:54:39] Tiano: perhaps

[28/12/2021, 15:01:59] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: The assignment seem like the text Analysis did for exam though are still alot of difference
[28/12/2021, 15:02:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: We used BST then
[28/12/2021, 15:08:58] Tiano: they have no knowledge of  BST
[28/12/2021, 15:11:26] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I understand boss
[28/12/2021, 15:12:05] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I'm sure he will give us a reason for doing that tomorrow

- We give debugging help only to those using the VM for the course?

[06/01/2022, 08:28:46] yussuf Paapy cmu: I think if the compilation errors are coming from the starter code “yes”, but if the errors are from the code he/she wrote, we can assist regardless of the environment he/she is using.
[06/01/2022, 08:45:19] Boris Lami cmu: Okay, cool.

[06/01/2022, 17:23:58] Baby: Good evening everyone. 
Our contracts says that we started from Jan 1st and will work until May 31.

Are we allowed to fill in the hours we have been using to solve the assignments, meet the prof, set up gradescope,...?
[06/01/2022, 17:24:08] Baby: Contact *
[06/01/2022, 17:24:20] Baby: Contract * eish
[06/01/2022, 17:24:35] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Lol
[06/01/2022, 17:24:52] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Is understanding that matters ma
[06/01/2022, 17:25:03] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: We can ask kompali
[06/01/2022, 17:25:47] Baby: I don't know if he understands the terms of the contract and all😅
[06/01/2022, 17:25:55] Boris Lami cmu: I think so, technically all of us don't have access to work day as of this instant
[06/01/2022, 17:27:04] Boris Lami cmu: He did engage us prior to the start of the semester, 🤣🤣🤣, wait a minute! when is finals week for spring 2022?
[06/01/2022, 17:27:13] Baby: I don't know if workday has been set up but we can ask Irene if we can fill those hours
[06/01/2022, 17:28:04] Baby: I kno the sem usually ends somewhere between the 22nd - 25th
[06/01/2022, 17:33:13] Boris Lami cmu: Okay, makes sense.
[06/01/2022, 17:34:05] Boris Lami cmu: Even if work day is setup later, it will be great if we can each take note of the various tasks / meetings and duration of time spent so when it's setup we just copy and paste
[06/01/2022, 17:35:08] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: We can create a Google doc for that and fill accordingly
[06/01/2022, 17:35:22] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: We actually started meeting him from last December
[06/01/2022, 17:35:52] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Our first meeting was 23rd I think

[17/01/2022, 19:01:57] Baby: Hi @2348092706568, in the zoom app, I think there is somewhere you can view zoom recordings if your are the host/cohost. Not so sure about the cohost part but you can check. Currently not on my machine so I can't verify
[17/01/2022, 19:02:48] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Oh ok

[19/01/2022, 11:14:42] Boris Lami cmu: Just confirming, @256784286046  will you be able to do the recording for the first homework?
[19/01/2022, 11:15:16] Boris Lami cmu: Zoom recording can be used I think, like using a recitation zoom link
[19/01/2022, 11:29:36] Tiano: I think @250784590341 is working on it.
Unless ofcourse you want to do it.
[19/01/2022, 11:30:06] Boris Lami cmu: That's okay. No thanks bro 😂

[19/01/2022, 14:03:02] Baby: I can't seem to be able to join mine.

[20/01/2022, 07:05:40] Boris Lami cmu: Created two threads, one for any hw1 worry, another for any VM setup worry
[24/01/2022, 09:29:56] Boris Lami cmu: Hey guys, 

Are we going to be recording each recitation?
[24/01/2022, 09:57:11] Baby: I think so. We won't post all the recordings but I think we record them, just in case
[24/01/2022, 09:59:22] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Has anyone gotten Workday email??
[24/01/2022, 09:59:38] Baby: I also think we kind of need to make the content consistent across the groups.
[24/01/2022, 09:59:50] Baby: No
[24/01/2022, 10:02:31] Boris Lami cmu: Okay
[24/01/2022, 10:02:42] Boris Lami cmu: Sure, that's definitely a plan.
[24/01/2022, 10:05:06] Boris Lami cmu: For this week -
Suggestion: 

1. Check the progress of each student on hw1 (submitted on autograder or not), if not why? Reiterate on avoiding AIV 

2. Review of LinkedList sample code (insertion strategy explanation)

3. Questions related to the homework / course material
[24/01/2022, 10:05:16] Boris Lami cmu: Not me
[24/01/2022, 10:06:14] Boris Lami cmu: I think SP did suggest we keep timesheets, anything you do for DSA TA work, note it there.
[25/01/2022, 15:18:22] Baby: Hey people! Are we doing a video for assignment 2?
[25/01/2022, 16:08:15] Tiano: as long as its not me recording

[25/01/2022, 17:48:25] yussuf Paapy cmu: The hints?
[25/01/2022, 17:56:17] Tiano: i think it's our responsibility to throw some hints on it in the recitations.  its purely based on pointers
[25/01/2022, 17:57:09] Tiano: or we can look in the book, where it talks about the trie

[26/01/2022, 12:34:10] yussuf Paapy cmu: IKR
[26/01/2022, 12:34:27] yussuf Paapy cmu: What is going to happen for WordForming
[26/01/2022, 12:34:29] yussuf Paapy cmu: ?
[26/01/2022, 12:35:12] Boris Lami cmu: I would understand if they were reusing UniqueInt shared by the professor
[26/01/2022, 12:37:16] Baby: I wish it was Data Analytics 😂
[26/01/2022, 12:37:18] Tiano: lets hope they have multiple students who can come up with their original students
[26/01/2022, 12:38:18] yussuf Paapy cmu: Students coming up with their original students😃
[26/01/2022, 12:38:37] yussuf Paapy cmu: Amen
[26/01/2022, 12:38:52] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 🤣
[26/01/2022, 12:40:14] Tiano: trie data structure
[26/01/2022, 12:40:58] yussuf Paapy cmu: Yeap

[26/01/2022, 12:42:20] yussuf Paapy cmu: Hold on, I missed this 😂
[26/01/2022, 12:42:43] Baby: I need hints 😂
[26/01/2022, 12:42:54] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Lol
[26/01/2022, 12:43:01] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Seniorman woman like you
[26/01/2022, 12:43:13] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: When you have already finish the assignment
[26/01/2022, 12:48:20] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: the lady that requested for Extension has submitted
[26/01/2022, 12:48:32] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: @237673944178
[26/01/2022, 12:48:55] Boris Lami cmu: Some similarity scores need further investigated in detail.
[26/01/2022, 12:49:16] Boris Lami cmu: Which lady?
[26/01/2022, 12:50:30] Tiano: you are playing games, wait for assignments when people write over 200 lines of code
[26/01/2022, 12:50:43] Tiano: there will be too much similarity, you might faint
[26/01/2022, 12:50:53] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: the one that sent an email that she lost someone
[26/01/2022, 12:51:10] Boris Lami cmu: I added it already and updated the email thread.

[26/01/2022, 12:54:53] Boris Lami cmu: Am I blind? I see no 64%

[26/01/2022, 12:57:15] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: and I am thinking whether gradescope is oka
[26/01/2022, 12:57:22] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: okay
[26/01/2022, 13:24:03] Boris Lami cmu: 🌚
[26/01/2022, 13:24:11] Boris Lami cmu: @2348092706568
[26/01/2022, 13:24:46] Boris Lami cmu: I'm thinking of pleading with SP to activate AIV OLI for DSA.
[26/01/2022, 13:24:53] Boris Lami cmu: What say you guys?
[26/01/2022, 13:25:24] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I think is too early man
[26/01/2022, 13:25:47] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: lets give them a second chance
[26/01/2022, 13:26:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I am looking at 63% similarity
[26/01/2022, 13:26:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: the similar lines seem to be like but student got the logic from same place
[26/01/2022, 13:30:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Some of this things could happen for reasons we can't explain
[26/01/2022, 13:32:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Imagine student get logic of implementation from one of us during recitation, if they went ahead to implement that logic...it will be similar on gradescope trust me
[26/01/2022, 13:42:21] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I guess we need to stop giving logic of Implementation during recitation
[26/01/2022, 13:50:40] yussuf Paapy cmu: I agree with u, but things of line validation should be different
[26/01/2022, 14:21:27] Tiano: man, i understand, but people will fail. Imagine we hadnt given you guys algorithms
[26/01/2022, 14:21:56] Tiano: algorithms are basically pseudo code. its not actual code.
[26/01/2022, 14:22:53] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I understand boss
[26/01/2022, 14:23:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I am just thinking
[26/01/2022, 14:23:33] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: even this gradscope similarity thing, I dont totally agree with it
[26/01/2022, 14:26:41] Tiano: okay
[26/01/2022, 14:27:26] Tiano: you see even second assignment will have alot of similarity because the pseudo code is in the book
[26/01/2022, 14:30:49] Tiano: and the hint of methods is given and their structure
[26/01/2022, 14:31:01] Tiano: as for the third 😀😀😀,
[26/01/2022, 14:31:25] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I understand thou
[27/01/2022, 08:51:08] Baby: Hi all ! Were you able to find resources for trie in the book?
[27/01/2022, 08:58:42] Boris Lami cmu: I have examined the book so far, the only thing closest to trie data structure is "Radix Tree" and some flavour of "Binary Tree". Has any "Tree" been converted in class?
[27/01/2022, 08:59:18] Baby: Hello Marie Louise
This is Aanu from DSA class

Please can you recommend a resource for Trie data structure for HW2. I've checked the recommended textbook but I can't find it there.
Or are we going to cover it in class/recitation anytime soon?
[27/01/2022, 09:01:16] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲 we need to write to SP asking about this.
[27/01/2022, 09:02:49] Boris Lami cmu: Do you guys think it'll be best to have sparse matrix take tue place of word forming?
[27/01/2022, 09:03:18] Boris Lami cmu: replace (tue, the)
[27/01/2022, 09:04:20] Baby: It would have been better but I know SP will probably not accept 😅 also, ain't there some people who have started assn2?
[27/01/2022, 09:06:13] Boris Lami cmu: Right. That's another thing. Technically, hw1 ends tonight and hw2 starts tomorrow
[27/01/2022, 09:07:39] Baby: If other TAs think we would rather start with sparse matrix, we can email SP
[27/01/2022, 09:07:58] Baby: Also, is sparse matrix exactly the same as the one we did?
[27/01/2022, 09:09:26] Baby: Asking to know if we can re use autograder for last year. Coz I don't think we have autograder set
[27/01/2022, 09:11:23] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[27/01/2022, 09:11:53] Baby: +1
[27/01/2022, 09:12:42] Boris Lami cmu: Very similar
[27/01/2022, 09:13:24] Boris Lami cmu: We can explicitly ask SP if we can get inspiration from the autograder of last semester to setup this one if he accepts to swap sparse matrix
[27/01/2022, 09:17:41] Baby: Anyway I just hope he accepts 😂
[27/01/2022, 09:54:13] Tiano: we can explore the options
[27/01/2022, 09:54:36] Tiano: but because he believes the assignment is easy, i highly doubt he would accept
[27/01/2022, 09:54:50] Tiano: the best we can do is recommend online sources
[27/01/2022, 09:54:53] Tiano: for them
[27/01/2022, 09:55:32] Tiano: theres a video i saw where it is discussed in java with some code, they can get a leaf from  there
[27/01/2022, 09:56:10] Tiano: https://youtu.be/giiaIofn31A
[27/01/2022, 09:57:37] Tiano: actually for this assignment, implementing the trie data structure is the easy part
[27/01/2022, 10:10:20] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲 code similarity
[27/01/2022, 10:47:56] Tiano: its java, the implementation doesnt work in cpp
[27/01/2022, 10:48:00] Tiano: you can try it
[27/01/2022, 11:32:27] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: @237673944178 are you going to send an email to SP abt this
[27/01/2022, 21:16:13] Boris Lami cmu: Okay bro
[27/01/2022, 21:16:28] Boris Lami cmu: Nope
[27/01/2022, 21:16:57] Boris Lami cmu: The way SP defended the hws last time we discussed, the only thing he would likely do is release the hints
[27/01/2022, 23:44:00] Tiano: so someone here spread these rumors, people are asking me if we are changing the assignment 🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
‎[27/01/2022, 23:46:33] Boris Lami cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[27/01/2022, 23:46:59] Boris Lami cmu: This is shocking
[27/01/2022, 23:56:28] yussuf Paapy cmu: Seriously???
[27/01/2022, 23:57:00] Baby: Wow😂😂😂
[27/01/2022, 23:57:51] Baby: Who did that?😂
[28/01/2022, 06:45:20] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Why are people like this you will say A, they turn it to Z, I guess the person asking you must have misquoted what I said and it is not to spread any rumor, so yesterday someone asked why assignment 2 is so difficult during my OH, and I said it is not or what would you like us to do change it which I jokingly said with no intention of spreading any rumors.....it is shocking how pple are coming to ask you this......I'm so sorry you all I must have caused this with my jokes.....We will correct this mindset during my recitation today.
[28/01/2022, 06:46:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Is that simple we aren't changing anything.
[28/01/2022, 06:47:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I'm sorry abt this....lesson learnt, I guess I have to be mindful of what I say next time before will quote me wrongly🙏🙏
[28/01/2022, 06:49:03] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: A blessed morning to you all
[28/01/2022, 06:50:07] Tiano: no worries man, just lessons, we all say somethings we shouldnt say at some point.
[28/01/2022, 06:51:39] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 🙏
[28/01/2022, 07:41:03] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[28/01/2022, 07:41:15] Boris Lami cmu: ✅
[28/01/2022, 07:42:11] Boris Lami cmu: We learn and then better ourselves
[28/01/2022, 07:43:37] Boris Lami cmu: Hey guys, link to slides for recitation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/122a2Xbl36l22_MpA6VL8XtKQ0HGhzSiC/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114445311342711809392&rtpof=true&sd=true

I plan on doing the recording by 10 am, latest 11 am, feedback is highly appreciated
[28/01/2022, 08:03:23] Tiano: hey Boris
[28/01/2022, 08:03:35] Tiano: thanks for these, looks awesome
[28/01/2022, 08:04:10] Tiano: am still reading through but gonna share a few corrections

[28/01/2022, 08:21:28] Boris Lami cmu: ✅ corrected
[28/01/2022, 12:30:11] Tiano: was ththe video released?
[28/01/2022, 14:06:40] Boris Lami cmu: Yeah

[28/01/2022, 14:09:40] Tiano: how long is it?
[28/01/2022, 14:10:17] Boris Lami cmu: Approx: 17 minutes
[28/01/2022, 14:10:35] Boris Lami cmu: Welcome, I now understand why you said ...
[28/01/2022, 14:10:49] Boris Lami cmu: 📌
[28/01/2022, 14:38:30] Tiano: 😅😅😅
[28/01/2022, 14:38:55] Tiano: talking recorded sense for that long is some what a problem
[28/01/2022, 14:46:33] Boris Lami cmu: From experience 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
[28/01/2022, 20:09:21] Tiano: yall looked at the similarity score?
[28/01/2022, 20:09:31] Tiano: things are bad
[28/01/2022, 20:12:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I did
[28/01/2022, 20:33:14] Boris Lami cmu: Yeah! It's getting out of hand sha
[28/01/2022, 20:33:41] Boris Lami cmu: What should we do about this?
‎[28/01/2022, 20:34:13] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[28/01/2022, 20:37:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: why am I seeing trie in homework1
[28/01/2022, 20:54:42] Tiano: i looked at the first guys
[28/01/2022, 20:54:53] Tiano: and the change is the variable names only
[28/01/2022, 20:56:04] yussuf Paapy cmu: What do we do guyz?
[28/01/2022, 20:56:42] Tiano: i guess we shall just tell SP that we suspect and he might have to review to confirm
[28/01/2022, 20:57:18] Tiano: or we tell him, to forgive them given its the first assignment
[28/01/2022, 21:01:59] Boris Lami cmu: nah! That's hw2
[28/01/2022, 21:02:24] Boris Lami cmu: It's amazing how they think they can "fool" the similarity checker
[28/01/2022, 21:02:45] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[28/01/2022, 21:02:56] yussuf Paapy cmu: Some people are not joking
[28/01/2022, 21:03:03] yussuf Paapy cmu: The guy is done
[28/01/2022, 21:03:17] yussuf Paapy cmu: The only problem is run time
[28/01/2022, 21:07:14] Boris Lami cmu: True
[28/01/2022, 21:07:29] Boris Lami cmu: My worry is, what has he learned by doing this assignment?
‎[28/01/2022, 21:10:34] Baby: ‎image omitted
[28/01/2022, 21:10:46] Baby: It's who
[28/01/2022, 21:11:02] yussuf Paapy cmu: Venant
[28/01/2022, 21:11:29] Baby: I know he started asking Qs a while ago
[28/01/2022, 21:11:50] yussuf Paapy cmu: So be prepared Francis and Louise
[28/01/2022, 21:12:06] yussuf Paapy cmu: He is coming for OH for code optimization
[28/01/2022, 21:12:15] Baby: 😂lmao
[28/01/2022, 21:12:25] Boris Lami cmu: 😂🤣🤣
[28/01/2022, 21:12:31] yussuf Paapy cmu: Forewarned ...
[28/01/2022, 21:12:38] Boris Lami cmu: You guys saw the private post on piazza 🌝🌚🥲
[28/01/2022, 21:14:57] yussuf Paapy cmu: Just saw it now
[28/01/2022, 21:15:48] yussuf Paapy cmu: But Boris, it's the reply for me 😂
[28/01/2022, 21:26:46] Boris Lami cmu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[28/01/2022, 21:27:01] Boris Lami cmu: Honestly, I feel he just copied code
[28/01/2022, 21:27:15] Boris Lami cmu: 📌
[28/01/2022, 21:27:40] yussuf Paapy cmu: Indeed
[28/01/2022, 21:27:52] yussuf Paapy cmu: But he provided references
[28/01/2022, 21:29:12] yussuf Paapy cmu: But I liked the answer you gave him tho, he needs to know the code for us to help him.
[28/01/2022, 21:36:36] Baby: From where? Internet?
[28/01/2022, 21:39:34] Boris Lami cmu: Look at the references 🥲
[28/01/2022, 21:40:35] Baby: Well I think as long as he understands and was able to remove unnecessary code
[28/01/2022, 21:40:40] Baby: It's fine
[28/01/2022, 21:40:51] Baby: But if he does not, then...
[28/01/2022, 21:41:53] Boris Lami cmu: I agree with you Marie, we are all learning.
[29/01/2022, 08:28:23] Tiano: one of us gotta send the mail to SP
[29/01/2022, 08:28:27] Tiano: hard times
‎[29/01/2022, 08:31:27] Boris Lami cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[29/01/2022, 08:48:49] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Abt??
[29/01/2022, 09:09:20] yussuf Paapy cmu: Similarities
[29/01/2022, 09:30:09] Boris Lami cmu: Should we consider reviewing each similarity?
[29/01/2022, 10:29:27] Tiano: not really
[29/01/2022, 10:30:00] Tiano: there are those that really look alike and the biggest change is variable names
[29/01/2022, 10:30:26] Tiano: but you have to sample some and look through
[29/01/2022, 10:44:54] Baby: We can just give warnings this time
[29/01/2022, 10:50:38] yussuf Paapy cmu: What if SP checks?
[29/01/2022, 11:08:24] Baby: I honestly don't know which English we will use to inform him such that the students won't be punished. This is the very first assignment, we can just warn them
[29/01/2022, 11:10:02] Baby: The problem is that it's very obvious that they copied, we can't even blame internet this time
[29/01/2022, 11:13:21] yussuf Paapy cmu: But then, isn't it going to bring some consequences on our side because we didn't inform SP?
[29/01/2022, 11:16:35] Baby: I don't know. TAs, what do you think? Am afraid SP might give them zeros
[29/01/2022, 11:17:32] Baby: Also we need to make it clear to them how gradescope works. Coz apparently they have changed variable names and functions positions thinking it will help
[29/01/2022, 11:18:27] yussuf Paapy cmu: Your ideas please!
[29/01/2022, 11:23:37] Baby: I understand we put ourselves in troubles by not reporting that, but can we say it in a way that won't affect the students
[29/01/2022, 11:30:39] Baby: The person who added the template on gradescope,  have you added the implementation of the char array? Gradescope is flagging it, and it shouldn't.
[29/01/2022, 11:31:35] yussuf Paapy cmu: ++
[29/01/2022, 11:32:04] yussuf Paapy cmu: He should add its implementation there.
[29/01/2022, 11:32:05] Boris Lami cmu: Which homework?
[29/01/2022, 11:32:17] yussuf Paapy cmu: hw1
[29/01/2022, 11:32:55] Boris Lami cmu: I added the template code exactly as it is in the sample code
[29/01/2022, 11:33:15] Boris Lami cmu: I am not sure I understand this worry
[29/01/2022, 11:34:35] Boris Lami cmu: Clarify please
[29/01/2022, 11:34:50] yussuf Paapy cmu: Like the bool arrays implementation
[29/01/2022, 11:35:05] yussuf Paapy cmu: Because it's likely to be the same.
[29/01/2022, 11:35:54] Boris Lami cmu: Likely, true, not !00% certain. A threshold can be used to ignore this.
[29/01/2022, 11:39:34] Baby: I saw cases where it's flagging that implementation. The threshold will also remove other similarities. A big threshold will not work for the char array since only a few students used it, and a small one will remove similarities that are due to cheating.
[29/01/2022, 11:40:28] Baby: Anyway, we will just go through manually. If in any case we have to report students, please don't do before you go through the code manually.

[29/01/2022, 13:00:25] Boris Lami cmu: I'm in a meeting, let me text later on this 🥲
[29/01/2022, 13:48:39] Tiano: i have not sent it, tell me if we should?
[29/01/2022, 13:48:49] Tiano: or what to change
[29/01/2022, 19:37:20] Baby: So what did we conclude?
[29/01/2022, 19:37:38] Baby: This looks okay
[29/01/2022, 20:04:40] Tiano: people ignored, i kept my peace
[29/01/2022, 20:07:24] Baby: 😂😂
[29/01/2022, 20:07:33] Baby: What do you guys think?
[29/01/2022, 20:07:59] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 👌👌
[29/01/2022, 20:55:13] yussuf Paapy cmu: This is okay
[29/01/2022, 20:57:05] Boris Lami cmu: I feel we need to rephrase this, it shouldn't come off as we are telling SP what to do
[29/01/2022, 20:58:49] Baby: How do you think we should say it
[29/01/2022, 20:59:55] Boris Lami cmu: Let me sleep on this and suggest something tomorrow.
[29/01/2022, 21:02:48] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Lol, 4unit course
[30/01/2022, 14:47:02] Baby: 😎
[30/01/2022, 14:47:18] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: still sleeping on it pls
[30/01/2022, 19:01:52] Boris Lami cmu: Probably sleep walking
[30/01/2022, 19:01:57] Boris Lami cmu: 🌚
[30/01/2022, 19:02:40] Boris Lami cmu: This what I suggest, in the grading sheet we put the similarity scores from Gradescope, SP will decide what to do.
[30/01/2022, 19:06:28] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: is still not a bad idea let him know in due time....I really dont think we have to now show the  similarity after grading
[30/01/2022, 19:06:35] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: to*
[30/01/2022, 19:07:25] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: If we let him know now, he can decide to check gradescope for himself and make judgement call
[30/01/2022, 19:11:37] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: In essence I am saying let's him know before starting to grade the assignment
[30/01/2022, 19:18:59] yussuf Paapy cmu: I think he needs to know it before the submissions of the next assignments so that he warns the students otherwise it might get out of control and students would find themselves with plagiarism in more than one assignment because they'll be like "changing variable names is working".
[30/01/2022, 19:19:30] yussuf Paapy cmu: And not forgetting the consequences it would attract to us(TAs).

[31/01/2022, 13:57:27] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: in class
[31/01/2022, 15:44:29] Tiano: so should we tell people their similarity score? i would rather keep to myself.
[31/01/2022, 15:49:07] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: if you do that you might  cause people to panic
[31/01/2022, 15:59:52] Tiano: yeah, exactly my though
[31/01/2022, 16:03:45] Boris Lami cmu: We can reiterate the consequences of sharing code but not tell them their similarity score
[31/01/2022, 16:04:23] Boris Lami cmu: Guys, I am taking a class that clashes with DSA on Monday and Wednesday, so it's less likely I would be able to assist in lectures.
[31/01/2022, 16:07:16] Tiano: no worries
[31/01/2022, 16:07:30] Tiano: Deji has all of us covered 😃😃

[02/02/2022, 09:18:02] Tiano: nope
[02/02/2022, 09:18:06] Tiano: •	Divide the students into DSA groups by creating breakout rooms - DSA-1, DSA-2, etc.
[02/02/2022, 09:18:11] Tiano: they can be more

[02/02/2022, 13:48:44] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And monitoring the activities why you present what you're preparing
[02/02/2022, 13:49:43] yussuf Paapy cmu: 🤝
[02/02/2022, 13:54:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: We kickoff at exactly 2pm
[02/02/2022, 13:55:26] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[02/02/2022, 13:55:37] Boris Lami cmu: And professor said that in the email
[02/02/2022, 13:55:42] Tiano: not worked
[02/02/2022, 13:55:49] Tiano: need a few more minutes
[02/02/2022, 13:55:57] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Sure boss
[02/02/2022, 13:56:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Take your time
[02/02/2022, 13:59:37] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Like how many mins do you need?
[02/02/2022, 13:59:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Let me find something to engage them
[02/02/2022, 14:00:11] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Pending the time you are ready
[02/02/2022, 14:00:23] Tiano: worked i think
[02/02/2022, 14:00:30] Tiano: joining the call
[02/02/2022, 14:00:39] yussuf Paapy cmu: I’ll be there to assist
[02/02/2022, 14:00:48] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Ok cool
[02/02/2022, 14:55:06] yussuf Paapy cmu: I think what Francis is sharing can attract Plagiarism
[02/02/2022, 14:55:53] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Some ppel will just printScreen already
[02/02/2022, 14:56:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: But we have to give them hint otherwise......
[02/02/2022, 14:57:27] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: But the fact that he show what it should like makes it okay
[02/02/2022, 14:57:43] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Anybody that copied he's showing right now all the best for them
[02/02/2022, 14:57:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: He's only giving an insight
[02/02/2022, 15:00:13] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: What*
[02/02/2022, 15:12:10] yussuf Paapy cmu: Please Francis don't share that code 🙏🏿
[02/02/2022, 15:12:28] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I already say no in the chat
[02/02/2022, 15:12:41] yussuf Paapy cmu: Cool
[02/02/2022, 15:12:46] yussuf Paapy cmu: Otherwise wahla
[02/02/2022, 15:12:52] yussuf Paapy cmu: *Wahala
[02/02/2022, 15:21:01] Tiano: what i have shared is not even 20% of the assignment,
[02/02/2022, 15:21:15] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: IKR
[02/02/2022, 15:22:40] Tiano: but if i over stepped, my bad guys
[02/02/2022, 15:24:03] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: is okay boss
[02/02/2022, 15:24:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I wonder what will be discussing if you have not come up with something
[02/02/2022, 15:26:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Kompali is here
[02/02/2022, 15:34:52] Tiano: 👍🏽
[03/02/2022, 16:24:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: @256784286046 have you seen kompali response abt the grades
[03/02/2022, 16:25:30] Tiano: yes seen
[03/02/2022, 16:25:35] Tiano: going to work on it
[03/02/2022, 16:40:22] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Ok boss🙏
[04/02/2022, 07:11:47] Boris Lami cmu: Who is able to fill hours in work day?
[04/02/2022, 07:52:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 👆
[04/02/2022, 08:19:29] Boris Lami cmu: 👍
[04/02/2022, 08:19:51] Boris Lami cmu: For some reason, I'm not able to fill in hours.
[04/02/2022, 08:51:00] Tiano: send mail to Irene and copy the hr mail box
[04/02/2022, 08:59:19] Boris Lami cmu: Gracias, on i
[04/02/2022, 08:59:21] Boris Lami cmu: *it

Let me know what you think guys
[04/02/2022, 21:07:28] Tiano: its the "Sending healthy vibes" for me
[04/02/2022, 21:49:31] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲, feel free to edit out anything that looks weird
[04/02/2022, 21:49:36] Boris Lami cmu: before we send to SP
[04/02/2022, 21:50:16] Tiano: well, i think you dont need the last gradescope
[04/02/2022, 21:50:32] Tiano: if i show it to you, you will be dis interested
[04/02/2022, 21:50:43] Tiano: the code was jambled
[04/02/2022, 21:50:47] Tiano: alot alot
[04/02/2022, 21:50:55] Baby: I think it's complex to understand.
[04/02/2022, 21:51:13] Baby: Unless he knows those code
[04/02/2022, 21:51:27] Tiano: i can share it and you have a look before you decide on the email
[04/02/2022, 21:51:58] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
[04/02/2022, 21:52:30] Boris Lami cmu: Oh I see!

From reading this, I already feel disinterested
[04/02/2022, 21:53:02] Baby: I mean F21 and S something something
[04/02/2022, 21:53:18] Baby: It took me a while to understand
[04/02/2022, 21:53:22] Tiano: its easier to make an edit of one of the previous assignments
[04/02/2022, 21:53:36] Boris Lami cmu: 👍🏻
[04/02/2022, 21:53:49] Tiano: let me get it
[04/02/2022, 21:54:15] Boris Lami cmu: Probably drop it in the dsa-ta folder (our private folder)
[04/02/2022, 21:54:27] Boris Lami cmu: Oh oh! Let's leave it out then
[04/02/2022, 21:58:45] Tiano: amma drop it here

[06/02/2022, 07:57:32] Baby: Hi TAs. I am sick since yesterday and will not do my usual OH today. I'll ask students to post burning questions on piazza. I'll appreciate if you could spend like 15min today to answer them, if any.
[06/02/2022, 09:06:35] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Get well soon Marie
[06/02/2022, 10:00:22] yussuf Paapy cmu: Quick recovery
[06/02/2022, 15:29:07] Baby: Thanks
[06/02/2022, 15:57:51] yussuf Paapy cmu: Check your inbox guyz
[06/02/2022, 16:23:37] Baby: Looks okay but I think he should ask the students to reach out to TAs if they think they didn't plegiarise.
[06/02/2022, 16:49:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: This is serious
[06/02/2022, 16:50:39] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Exactly, some might be due to getting Same idea of implementation
[06/02/2022, 16:52:17] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And besides the way gradescope detect similarity  is somehow thou
[06/02/2022, 16:52:33] Baby: I went through and realized the char implementation itself is adding 14%.
[06/02/2022, 16:52:47] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Exactly
[06/02/2022, 16:54:14] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I looked at the person that has 63% similarity....it was only a few lines that looked similar and it gave it a similarity of 63%
[06/02/2022, 16:54:41] Baby: Everyone who has more than 16% similarity and was flagged due to char implementation had some other similarities which cannot be explained. However I think it's unfair to them given that some other people cheated and have like 15% which is acceptable.
[06/02/2022, 16:54:46] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Please let's agree on what to respond
[06/02/2022, 16:56:37] Baby: I saw someone who had around 35 and only a few lines were flagged but when I looked manually, they had similarity that is not flagged.
[06/02/2022, 16:59:28] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Exactly what I see too
[06/02/2022, 16:59:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Can we call for a meeting with him please??
[06/02/2022, 17:00:01] Baby: Just saw that case of 64
[06/02/2022, 17:00:15] Baby: The char array still
[06/02/2022, 17:00:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: You see the lines
[06/02/2022, 17:01:07] Baby: Yeah. It's because both files are small. Like if you have 10 lines and 6 are flagged that's 60%
[06/02/2022, 17:01:24] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And the person is someone that I know so well that she wrote her code herself, she's in your group thou
[06/02/2022, 17:01:35] Baby: What I can suggest is we look through manually before deducting marks
[06/02/2022, 17:01:48] Baby: Yeah.
[06/02/2022, 17:02:04] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: We need to let him know some of the flaws in gradescope similarity check
[06/02/2022, 17:02:24] Baby: It's only the char array tho.
[06/02/2022, 17:02:44] Baby: As I said, the person who added the template should have added the char implementation
[06/02/2022, 17:02:48] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I mean everyone is doing the same assignment so there's chance pple have something similar but it shouldn't be much
[06/02/2022, 17:03:07] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Exactly
[06/02/2022, 17:03:37] Baby: We will have to go through manually.
[06/02/2022, 17:09:06] Baby: At some point the bool array was also flagged
[06/02/2022, 17:10:03] Baby: Two students have one similarity, for the bool array, their score is 22%
[06/02/2022, 17:10:31] Baby: If you guys don't mind I'll add both implementations in the templates
[06/02/2022, 17:18:18] yussuf Paapy cmu: I don't mind and I feel like the bool array implementation is not supposed to be flagged by gradescope.
[06/02/2022, 17:18:46] Baby: Let me add and see new stats
[06/02/2022, 17:18:59] Baby: I'll remove them if needed
[06/02/2022, 17:34:33] Baby: I just added the two implementations. I think it looks okay now. You can go through and see if there is something wrong now
[06/02/2022, 18:42:22] Baby: Hi guys. Would you kindly go through gradescope similarity and see if 16% will be fair. We need to reply to SP by morning
[06/02/2022, 18:56:54] Boris Lami cmu: Oh oh! Quick recover Marie the Beautiful
[06/02/2022, 18:58:13] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[06/02/2022, 19:03:30] yussuf Paapy cmu: 16% is not fair
[06/02/2022, 19:04:47] Boris Lami cmu: Elaborate please
[06/02/2022, 19:10:54] yussuf Paapy cmu: There are some code that gradescope is flagging that I can write also, but there are some cases where it seems fair. All I can say is that  we can not base 100% the decision on gradescope similarity may be 20%.
‎[06/02/2022, 19:11:11] yussuf Paapy cmu: Screenshot from 2022-02-06 18-26-01.png ‎document omitted
[06/02/2022, 19:11:40] yussuf Paapy cmu: I can write this code @237673944178
[06/02/2022, 19:13:15] yussuf Paapy cmu: But there some scenarios where it's obvious that people have shared codes.
[06/02/2022, 19:16:17] Boris Lami cmu: Okay, I get what you mean. So suggestion to SP will be?
[06/02/2022, 19:22:00] yussuf Paapy cmu: May be we could check the similarities manually and make a judgement call before penalizing everyone who has a similarity above 16%
[06/02/2022, 19:30:07] Boris Lami cmu: Can you create an email file in the folder for emails and place this?
[06/02/2022, 19:30:48] Boris Lami cmu: I'm no longer seeing this 63%, any idea what happened?
[06/02/2022, 19:31:50] Baby: I added the bool and char implementation in the template
[06/02/2022, 19:32:05] Baby: I can remove them if you guys require
[06/02/2022, 19:33:21] Tiano: i think you should leave them
[06/02/2022, 19:35:32] Tiano: me i think we should just focus on the list of students with the similarity above 16%. We can review these manually, if there is surety that they copied code, then we add them to the sheet. For those not being flaged, life no balance. Otherwise we shall have to go through 78 submissions for every assignment
[06/02/2022, 19:36:33] Boris Lami cmu: True, somehow we are trusting Gradescope's judgement
[06/02/2022, 19:38:30] Boris Lami cmu: If we are to leave it, I think SP should know about this given that the number 28 in SP's email won't be valid and ... you can imagine if he later notices and is not in agreement.
[06/02/2022, 19:44:34] Boris Lami cmu: SP's opening sentence

*We have verified all cases which were flagged as similar by gradescope...*
[06/02/2022, 20:00:38] Baby: Well I will remove them then
[06/02/2022, 20:00:55] Baby: I also thought about that and it's a mistake from our end
[06/02/2022, 20:01:53] Baby: All in all none should be penalised for using a bool/char implementation
[06/02/2022, 20:04:06] Tiano: no leave them
[06/02/2022, 20:04:15] Tiano: we will explain
[06/02/2022, 20:04:32] Tiano: all in all, someones gonna draft a response
[06/02/2022, 20:05:12] Baby: (With screenshots)
[06/02/2022, 20:05:35] Baby: All we can do is ask to go through manually

Do us the honour please
[06/02/2022, 23:30:15] Baby: People...
[06/02/2022, 23:30:40] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: response to the mail
[07/02/2022, 00:17:04] Tiano: check
[07/02/2022, 00:19:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: well drafted
[07/02/2022, 00:23:17] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: For me GradeScope check has it own flaws honestly, anyone who understand it can easily game it.....and it wont be seen that such person copied which wont be fair
[07/02/2022, 04:10:13] Boris Lami cmu: LGTM
[07/02/2022, 07:59:48] yussuf Paapy cmu: Looks okay.
[07/02/2022, 09:36:48] Tiano: i think we just need to advise students to put comments in their code
[07/02/2022, 09:52:01] Baby: They need to reference actually
[07/02/2022, 10:02:20] Boris Lami cmu: Right. 

We did what we could sha
[07/02/2022, 10:02:58] Boris Lami cmu: @250784590341 , inspiration from here.
[07/02/2022, 10:03:40] Tiano: exaclty, it is hard to win with SP.
[07/02/2022, 10:09:07] Tiano: i think copying code online holds as plagiarism in SP's case.
[07/02/2022, 10:10:27] Boris Lami cmu: Exactly!
[07/02/2022, 10:17:01] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: this 16% is somehow honestly
[07/02/2022, 10:19:09] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I wonder what will happen in Redblack tree assignment where the left and right algorithm is one way and is even in the textbook
[07/02/2022, 10:50:56] Tiano: okay, who wants to post?
[07/02/2022, 10:52:35] Boris Lami cmu: I'll do it.
[07/02/2022, 10:53:42] Tiano: cool
[07/02/2022, 11:07:04] Boris Lami cmu: Done ✅

[07/02/2022, 19:13:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: you could have just check under zoom tab -> recording for the link
[07/02/2022, 19:14:14] Boris Lami cmu: Thanks man, I see it now.
[07/02/2022, 19:14:34] Boris Lami cmu: For some reason, I checked about an hour, 20 minutes ago and didn't see it.
[07/02/2022, 19:16:14] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: So guys, I am just curious to know what happens if after deducting marks of those that have similarity of 16% and above but the students come to make claims that they did not copy code from anyone or share code with anyone, what do we do??
[07/02/2022, 19:17:15] Baby: Look through and see if it makes sense I guess.
[07/02/2022, 19:17:36] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: will that make us return the mark??
[07/02/2022, 19:17:51] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I guess SP need to answer that actually??
[07/02/2022, 19:17:51] Baby: I think
[07/02/2022, 19:18:06] Baby: If a student complain, they should be regarded
[07/02/2022, 19:18:17] Baby: I think there are people we should not penalise tho
[07/02/2022, 19:18:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: regraded you mean??
[07/02/2022, 19:18:26] Baby: Say Aanu for instance
[07/02/2022, 19:18:36] Baby: Yeah.😂
[07/02/2022, 19:18:36] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Yea
[07/02/2022, 19:19:01] Baby: Her case should be ignored.
[07/02/2022, 19:19:06] Boris Lami cmu: Any claims: email SP and TAs. We all know SP has the final say.
[07/02/2022, 19:19:15] Boris Lami cmu: What happened please?
[07/02/2022, 19:19:40] Baby: I think I'll give you a screenshot
[07/02/2022, 19:19:47] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: bcos I looked at her code and funny how she does not even know the person whom gradescope claim she has similarity
[07/02/2022, 19:20:20] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: the first time Gradescope paired her Similarity with Yves
[07/02/2022, 19:20:27] Baby: So you told her she has similarity?
[07/02/2022, 19:20:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: then Later it paired with Elizabeth
[07/02/2022, 19:20:42] Boris Lami cmu: Okay
[07/02/2022, 19:20:47] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I didnt tell her anything
[07/02/2022, 19:20:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I am just saying this here

[07/02/2022, 19:23:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I actually monitored this assignment 1 submission bcos I get notication when anyone submit
[07/02/2022, 19:24:21] Tiano: ehhh congratulations 😂😂🎉
[07/02/2022, 19:24:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: that was how I was able to tell this
[07/02/2022, 19:24:46] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: and this
[07/02/2022, 19:25:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: lol, this guy is mocking
[07/02/2022, 19:25:04] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: me*
‎[07/02/2022, 19:25:07] Baby: ‎audio omitted
[07/02/2022, 19:25:25] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: anyways I rest my case
[07/02/2022, 19:25:40] Baby: Forgive my VN but I wanted something quick
[07/02/2022, 19:29:04] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I dont understand the part you said 5 lines 50 lines of code against 100 lines 600 lines of code
[07/02/2022, 19:29:10] Boris Lami cmu: I just examined what you said and it's very weird Marie.
[07/02/2022, 19:29:15] Tiano: but similarity flags 2 people, unless both of them do this
[07/02/2022, 19:29:33] Tiano: mathematics 🤣🤣
[07/02/2022, 19:29:52] Boris Lami cmu: Omo! Go and build neural network boy
‎[07/02/2022, 19:30:06] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[07/02/2022, 19:30:12] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: that's why this gradescope thing is just not it
[07/02/2022, 19:30:33] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I have seen this Boris
[07/02/2022, 19:30:46] Boris Lami cmu: 42 lines => 63% (.h) and 
101 lines => 35% (.cpp)
[07/02/2022, 19:31:05] Tiano: it uses percentages, similar lines over total lines in the file * 100%
[07/02/2022, 19:31:21] Boris Lami cmu: Exactly!
[07/02/2022, 19:31:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: which is not logicali actually
[07/02/2022, 19:31:32] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: logical*
[07/02/2022, 19:31:33] Boris Lami cmu: FYI, I was agreeing with Marie here
[07/02/2022, 19:31:33] Tiano: yall just wilding
[07/02/2022, 19:32:22] Tiano: we should come to terms that SP trusts geadescope 100%
[07/02/2022, 19:32:27] Boris Lami cmu: The only way we can trust the similarity checker is if we can somehow merge the two files as one for the checking
[07/02/2022, 19:32:33] Tiano: we shall have peace ✌️
‎[07/02/2022, 19:32:44] Boris Lami cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[07/02/2022, 19:32:59] Baby: Basically if your file has 10 lines and 5 are flagged, your similarity is 5/10 = 50%

And if you have 600 lines and 100 are flagged you have 100/600 =  16%

That's why for people whose similarities are in .h file, they have a bigger percentage
[07/02/2022, 19:33:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: then pple will get penalty Unnecessarily if this the case
[07/02/2022, 19:33:24] Baby: For you @237673944178
[07/02/2022, 19:33:26] Tiano: and we can not counter him if he says he went through manually
[07/02/2022, 19:33:52] Baby: But have you checked Annu's case.
[07/02/2022, 19:33:55] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: oh I see what you mean now
[07/02/2022, 19:33:58] Boris Lami cmu: Marie the Beautiful, I have understood what you explained in the voice note.
[07/02/2022, 19:34:12] Boris Lami cmu: We definitely need to email SP on this
[07/02/2022, 19:34:23] Baby: I honestly don't understand why we should disturb a student while we know 100% that she has not cheated
[07/02/2022, 19:34:50] Boris Lami cmu: We should not, definitely not
[07/02/2022, 19:35:00] Baby: Imagine she even doesn't have any other similarities. Not even 1%
[07/02/2022, 19:35:25] Boris Lami cmu: I am thinking, is there a way we can normalize the similarity scores between .h and .cpp files?
[07/02/2022, 19:35:49] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Use MLP Bro
[07/02/2022, 19:36:04] Tiano: who is this
[07/02/2022, 19:36:11] Boris Lami cmu: bro, I am about to send hw2p2 ya way
[07/02/2022, 19:36:17] Boris Lami cmu: 🤣🤣🤣
[07/02/2022, 19:36:33] Boris Lami cmu: Aanu
[07/02/2022, 19:36:50] Boris Lami cmu: @256784286046
[07/02/2022, 19:37:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯
[07/02/2022, 19:39:04] Baby: There are 3 students who got flagged in .h, and venant(17), professor(17) and Aanu(63), for both cases, if their code were in .cpp, it would probably have not been more than 10%
[07/02/2022, 19:39:09] Boris Lami cmu: I am seeing 13 lines similar here, where did gradescope get 42 lines from?
[07/02/2022, 19:40:11] Tiano: okay we shall ignore the .h
[07/02/2022, 19:40:21] Tiano: we can send a mail to SP on that
[07/02/2022, 19:40:30] Boris Lami cmu: Looking at all of this, we need to find some logical formula to merge similarity scores of .h and .cpp. 

SP will want numbers
[07/02/2022, 19:40:56] Baby: Where is 42? Starter code may be
[07/02/2022, 19:42:34] Boris Lami cmu: I am so confused. It's like we need to understand the exact Maths Gradescope is doing.
[07/02/2022, 19:45:02] Baby: The match length includes the starter code too
[07/02/2022, 19:45:13] Baby: But it looks more accurate to me
[07/02/2022, 19:45:45] Baby: As in people with a higher match length are the people who actually cheated. But then percentages...no
[07/02/2022, 19:46:32] Baby: I think if you sort by match length, it will make sense
[07/02/2022, 19:48:39] Boris Lami cmu: Your point is very valid Marie
[07/02/2022, 19:48:45] Boris Lami cmu: I couldn't agree more
[07/02/2022, 19:49:12] Boris Lami cmu: However treating similarity for .h and .cpp different won't be healthy
[07/02/2022, 19:49:21] Boris Lami cmu: We need a way to combine both
[07/02/2022, 19:49:38] Boris Lami cmu: The SP I know won't accept to ignore .h
‎[07/02/2022, 19:52:15] Baby: ‎image omitted
[07/02/2022, 19:53:13] Baby: There are two cases in .h, the one for Aanu, and this one
[07/02/2022, 19:53:45] Baby: This has 17%
[07/02/2022, 19:55:54] Baby: Funny thing if you open this case, on the right side there is a list of other students with the same lines of code but in .cpp. their score is 14%
[08/02/2022, 14:12:48] Boris Lami cmu: In other matters, who's gonna do the video for assignment 3, there is post request for this.
[08/02/2022, 14:18:38] Tiano: tell them we won't.
‎[08/02/2022, 14:19:12] Boris Lami cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[08/02/2022, 14:31:24] Tiano: like for real
[08/02/2022, 14:31:51] Tiano: seen that post and am like 'they are rushing us to do them a favor' like wow
[08/02/2022, 14:54:29] Baby: Good afternoon @2348092706568 😂 I hope you are good
[08/02/2022, 15:00:11] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Good afternoon Marie Louise, I trust you're feeling well now😁
[08/02/2022, 15:34:28] Tiano: also guys please look through assignment 5, i have no idea how to go about it, so if you do, please speak out otherwise am drafting a mail to SP by Friday
[09/02/2022, 07:58:12] Tiano: so guys, I have sent some fire to SP
[09/02/2022, 08:24:01] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: seen and I hope he agrees
[09/02/2022, 08:24:11] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: this forth and back thou
[09/02/2022, 08:25:20] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: making it seem like we shouldn't have inform him....is word against SP
[09/02/2022, 08:25:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: our*

[09/02/2022, 08:31:19] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: lol, my reflection how

[09/02/2022, 11:15:43] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: If we are not careful doesnt mind punishing even the innocent
[09/02/2022, 11:16:36] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: he*
[09/02/2022, 11:17:09] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: it is not under my name and watch they will send somebody's child home😢
[09/02/2022, 11:21:27] Baby: Aanu is the most innocent student in that assignment actually
[09/02/2022, 11:23:45] Boris Lami cmu: I couldn't agree more. However, I think we shouldn't turn a blind to other potential innocent people.
[09/02/2022, 11:25:04] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: sure, i totally agree
[09/02/2022, 11:34:50] Baby: Gradescope should just be used as a tool to show us  potential AIV cases
[09/02/2022, 11:37:45] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: @250784590341 your email is strong o

[09/02/2022, 11:56:34] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: maybe sparse matrix
[09/02/2022, 11:57:23] Boris Lami cmu: @250788947977 , long time. You there?
[09/02/2022, 11:58:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: by the way which tool do you guys normally use to run the video

[09/02/2022, 20:37:34] Baby: I know but the real question is will they approve?
[09/02/2022, 20:37:52] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Why not
[09/02/2022, 20:38:59] Baby: Coz school started on the 17th. I wanna know if they won't approve so that I put very many hours in the last 2 weeks😂
[09/02/2022, 20:39:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: The contract is from Jan 4th I think

[10/02/2022, 12:01:40] Baby: I suppose SP talked about it yesterday but I wasn't in class

[10/02/2022, 21:34:04] Baby: Deji you should pay for the damage you just caused
[10/02/2022, 21:34:17] Tiano: its archived coz is more than a week past publishment date
[10/02/2022, 21:34:26] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: you know we are learners in this gradescope thing and you are the expert
[10/02/2022, 21:34:40] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I get it now

[10/02/2022, 21:35:15] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Imagine we couldnt find it anymore
[10/02/2022, 21:35:34] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Kompali will just fire all of us
[10/02/2022, 21:35:44] Baby: 💀

[10/02/2022, 21:36:44] Baby: Now I feel like I no longer want the TA privilege on gradescope 😂cause I can accidentally delete it

[11/02/2022, 11:59:27] Boris Lami cmu: This is probably the cloud allocating resources.

[11/02/2022, 12:08:37] Boris Lami cmu: Please be patient and feel free to kickstart on hw3 and ask questions for clarification on piazza. However, the deadline for hw2 is next Monday.

A brief video explaining how to kickstart hw3 will be released after the official deadline for hw2.
[11/02/2022, 12:12:01] Tiano: who is doing the video again?
[11/02/2022, 12:13:41] Baby: I'll do it over the weekend

[11/02/2022, 16:02:09] Tiano: i think I might do a session tomorrow to help these guys understand a binary search tree
the red black builds on the bst
[11/02/2022, 16:02:19] Tiano: hope thats fine with you guys
[11/02/2022, 16:07:13] Baby: Of course it's fine

[11/02/2022, 16:14:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: has the issue of autograder been resolved??
[11/02/2022, 19:30:11] Boris Lami cmu: Sure, I think that's a great idea
[11/02/2022, 19:30:21] Boris Lami cmu: Gonna be recorded for those who can't make it?
[11/02/2022, 19:43:57] Tiano: i guess so
[11/02/2022, 19:44:27] Tiano: what time should i go with?

[12/02/2022, 23:46:45] Baby: Hey guys

[13/02/2022, 09:34:19] Baby: Hi gus!
I think we need to write a note clarifying the use of external resources. I have had students asking if they are safe since they used external resources for some implementations and  might have similarities.
[13/02/2022, 09:35:00] Baby: And I think the same will apply for the next assignment
[13/02/2022, 09:37:37] Baby: I told them they are safe if they did not copy paste and were able to filter which information is relavant to the assignment and which one is not. And while implementations(algorithms) of some methods might be similar, we can tell if the student has copied or not
[13/02/2022, 09:38:41] Baby: I think we need to clarify that coz  I also don't know if what I said was correct 😂
[14/02/2022, 07:05:06] Boris Lami cmu: It's been a long weekend for some people v🥲
[14/02/2022, 07:05:53] Boris Lami cmu: I think professor once hinted this possibility sometime ago about this particular homework for red black tree.
[14/02/2022, 07:06:15] Boris Lami cmu: Can we have the students ask the professor in class so he clarifies this to all of them?
[14/02/2022, 07:28:14] Baby: Okay...

[21/02/2022, 10:01:33] Baby: Hey TAs. Please when students come to your OH/recitation, can you remind them to reference the resources they used, if any. If they don't reference and have similarities, it will be hard to convience SP that it's just internet resources

[21/02/2022, 17:37:58] Baby: Are there any plagiarism cases?

[21/02/2022, 17:45:27] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: wait for it
[21/02/2022, 17:46:03] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: thank God I told him about that during our meetings back in the day
[21/02/2022, 17:46:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I will just recall that when the time comes
[21/02/2022, 17:49:03] yussuf Paapy cmu: @237673944178 what do we do?
[21/02/2022, 17:49:43] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: whatever you are going to do....pls dont let SP send someone child out of cmu
[21/02/2022, 17:52:17] yussuf Paapy cmu: Okay, what do we do?
[21/02/2022, 17:54:37] Boris Lami cmu: Let run recitation and get here shortly.
[21/02/2022, 17:55:03] yussuf Paapy cmu: Okay sir.
[21/02/2022, 19:32:57] Boris Lami cmu: Is there a way to export similarity scores from Gradescope?
[21/02/2022, 19:36:12] yussuf Paapy cmu: @250784590341 @256784286046

[22/02/2022, 11:38:31] Boris Lami cmu: Hey guys

Autograder for Sparse Matrix is up, feel free to try it out guys. If you notice a bug, please "hala here"
[22/02/2022, 11:39:18] yussuf Paapy cmu: 👏🏿
[22/02/2022, 11:43:33] Tiano: remember to send SP a mail about it.
[22/02/2022, 11:44:02] Boris Lami cmu: Right, there's a shared drive for all autograder scripts?
[22/02/2022, 11:55:43] Tiano: yeah
[22/02/2022, 11:56:02] Boris Lami cmu: Found it
[22/02/2022, 12:35:17] Boris Lami cmu: 📌

[22/02/2022, 12:42:50] Tiano: i was adding most of the used methods

[22/02/2022, 12:54:39] Tiano: but the similarity threshold should be put higher this time, we are gonna have alot of exchange with SP if he sets a very low threshold.
[22/02/2022, 12:55:20] yussuf Paapy cmu: I agree with this
[22/02/2022, 12:55:34] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: me waiting for this

[22/02/2022, 17:54:41] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
[22/02/2022, 17:55:35] Boris Lami cmu: I have been thinking about this for some time now. The various approaches I can think of are very much subjective
[22/02/2022, 17:56:09] Boris Lami cmu: The most robust way to have a single similarity score for .h and .cpp is to merge these two files upon submission
[22/02/2022, 17:57:22] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: For all the 78 students....you are doing well
[22/02/2022, 17:58:27] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Doing this will only reduce percentage on gradescope I think
[22/02/2022, 17:59:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Wait
[22/02/2022, 17:59:26] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: How do you want to do this
[22/02/2022, 18:00:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Don't tell me you want to download all the submissions and merge them??🤔🤔
[22/02/2022, 18:00:52] Boris Lami cmu: I have been thinking and this is the only most feasible solution
[22/02/2022, 18:01:38] Boris Lami cmu: Create a similarity homework for each homework say.

*Homework 1 Similarity* and submit for everyone ( *merge files* )
[22/02/2022, 18:01:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And you think this will help
[22/02/2022, 18:01:55] Boris Lami cmu: Yeah! What do you think?
[22/02/2022, 18:02:40] Boris Lami cmu: Better than nothing I guess. Imagine Aanu's situation from last time.
[22/02/2022, 18:03:05] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: From my understanding of how gradescope work, they will only reduce the percentage since the file be lengthy
[22/02/2022, 18:03:19] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Between if you do it will break some pples code
[22/02/2022, 18:03:46] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 🤔🤔🤔 is tricky thou
[22/02/2022, 18:04:18] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Unless you want to start debugging pples code
[22/02/2022, 18:04:35] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: This is a dilemma
[22/02/2022, 18:05:41] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: So wait why don't you want to look through what you have on gradescope right now....even if it is doing it base on .h and .cpp
[22/02/2022, 18:06:58] Boris Lami cmu: You remember Aanu's case, right? This one was very obvious, doesn't mean there weren't others and I feel we just neglected them. Some sort of "favouritism from the TAs"
[22/02/2022, 18:07:48] Boris Lami cmu: The objective of *Assignment x Similarity* is not to get scores, no autograder. 
It simply has to do with obtaining a more authentic similarity score by merging .h and .cpp for each student.
[22/02/2022, 18:07:51] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: For me your best bet will be to look at each code similarity the way it is on gradescope...having to merge will not make any difference in my opinion
[22/02/2022, 18:09:10] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Favouritism how??
[22/02/2022, 18:11:30] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: So you are thinking merging the two files will give you the authentic score
‎[22/02/2022, 18:12:46] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[22/02/2022, 18:13:03] Boris Lami cmu: Yeah! You think it won't?
[22/02/2022, 18:15:33] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I doubt that will do anything, I feel like it will just give you one score or percentage which in my opinion is not a good yardstick
[22/02/2022, 18:16:01] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And that's where my problem is with the gradation thing
[22/02/2022, 18:18:08] Boris Lami cmu: Okay, which do you prefer, the present one (.cpp and .h separate scores), or having a merged .cpp and .h comparison?
[22/02/2022, 18:18:26] Boris Lami cmu: So, we go manual for the similarity checking
[22/02/2022, 18:18:28] Boris Lami cmu: ?
[22/02/2022, 18:18:44] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Oh I see what you mean, like pardoning someone with a case of 63% and pushing someone with 17% if I'm getting you right
[22/02/2022, 18:19:30] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Purnishing
[22/02/2022, 18:19:37] Boris Lami cmu: Exactly 🎯 with SP's 16% threshold
[22/02/2022, 18:20:23] Boris Lami cmu: 63% 
@256784286046 , @250788947977 , @250784590341
[22/02/2022, 18:21:05] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: For that 16% percent threshold I really don't agree with him but he has the final say
[22/02/2022, 18:21:30] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Wait you are still going back to the Duplicate int
[22/02/2022, 18:25:00] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲
[22/02/2022, 18:25:22] Boris Lami cmu: Yeah!
[22/02/2022, 18:26:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: So I think for the case of Aanu Marie said it was due to the bool array implementation
[22/02/2022, 18:27:18] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And I guess she checked if that was the same situation for others before deciding on plagiarism
[22/02/2022, 18:28:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: So the person that got 17% case might not bool array and prolly the similarity was obvious
[22/02/2022, 18:29:08] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[22/02/2022, 18:29:10] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲🥲 you're leaving out the fact that .h files are not of the same code length as .cpp and this influences the similarity score.
[22/02/2022, 18:30:03] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Yeah I know that right
[22/02/2022, 18:30:43] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I guess she checked the length
[22/02/2022, 18:31:14] Boris Lami cmu: If SP really checked, he would have caught Aanu's case.
I bet he didn't check.
[22/02/2022, 18:31:32] Boris Lami cmu: ...everything. He skimmed.
[22/02/2022, 18:31:55] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Lol, bur the man said he did
[22/02/2022, 18:32:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: And this boils down to what we tell him
[22/02/2022, 18:33:41] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I actually doubt he did a thorough check as well
[22/02/2022, 18:33:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: 💯
‎[22/02/2022, 18:34:03] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[22/02/2022, 18:35:14] Boris Lami cmu: I fear for some people who might end being penalized if we don't figure out how to address this. We all know SP is not joking.
[22/02/2022, 18:36:41] Boris Lami cmu: If everyone is in agreement, I suggest a meeting with SP tomorrow (13h00) to discuss this.
[22/02/2022, 18:37:02] Boris Lami cmu: ... prior to submitting a similarity score report to SP
[22/02/2022, 18:39:06] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: That man trust gradescope like anything
[22/02/2022, 18:51:16] Tiano: i think we gonna go manual on the similarity check. When SP gives a threshold, we will have to review all those affected and either recommend a different threshold or excuse those we feel shouldnt be punished. This time so many people got their code online, those who were wise enough to redo the comments and edit the flow will be excused, coz we will bargain for them.
[22/02/2022, 18:52:40] Tiano: i think submit the score and let him know what your thoughts are. the meeting would make more sense when he has an understanding of what the situation is like.
[22/02/2022, 19:03:34] Baby: 😂😂😂😂😂
[22/02/2022, 19:07:16] Baby: Who is s/he? I remover everyone whose case was like Aanu's. I also added implementations to the template and checked manually.
[22/02/2022, 19:08:58] Baby: I agree. When is townhall again? Also if we suggest a meeting, we need to have an agenda.
[22/02/2022, 20:56:52] Boris Lami cmu: Venant, you can check on Gradescope https://www.gradescope.com/courses/342545/assignments/1732815/review_similarity
[22/02/2022, 20:57:52] Boris Lami cmu: Okay bro
[22/02/2022, 20:58:51] Baby: Will re-check tomorrow mais aussi loin que je me rapelles his similarity was something else. Will check and confirm
[22/02/2022, 20:59:15] Boris Lami cmu: 👍🏻
[22/02/2022, 20:59:47] Boris Lami cmu: Did SP agree to the removal of anyone besides Aanu who had this situation?
[22/02/2022, 21:00:18] Boris Lami cmu: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16p5_zh4dBBTIUaWCp7YUQCp8C7JHnGyk28Sc33Tl9QI/edit, let me know what you think guys
[22/02/2022, 21:00:31] Boris Lami cmu: hw2 similarity summary
[22/02/2022, 21:22:08] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Examining a number of cases of similarities revealed very similar code with some having mainly changes in method and variable names (see sample screenshot below). See link for details.
[22/02/2022, 21:22:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Boris I feel this statement will cause more harm than good
[22/02/2022, 21:24:27] Tiano: like you are writing phd research proposal
‎[22/02/2022, 21:24:47] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[22/02/2022, 21:24:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I am telling you
[22/02/2022, 21:25:00] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: very detailed
[22/02/2022, 21:25:50] Tiano: but that screenshot is funny
[22/02/2022, 21:26:33] Tiano: guys changed word names like getScore to scoreGet, findWord to wordFind
[22/02/2022, 21:27:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: which I think SP will capitalise on
[22/02/2022, 21:29:17] yussuf Paapy cmu: Another thing is when you tell these people to write meaningful names they are like "why"
[22/02/2022, 21:29:28] yussuf Paapy cmu: Troubles
[22/02/2022, 21:30:08] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲 I could just be an active PhD student doing Masters 😅
[22/02/2022, 21:30:57] Boris Lami cmu: Feel free to make suggestions to the doc
[22/02/2022, 21:31:39] Boris Lami cmu: Kinda writing what I am seeing 😬
[22/02/2022, 21:42:33] Boris Lami cmu: @256784286046 , @250784590341 , @2348092706568 , @250788947977 . Let me know when this is good to go.
[22/02/2022, 23:10:39] Boris Lami cmu: 🌚🌝
[22/02/2022, 23:39:01] Tiano: early morning
‎[23/02/2022, 17:35:56] Boris Lami cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[23/02/2022, 17:36:11] Boris Lami cmu: This plenty emails for choice of midterm format
[23/02/2022, 17:36:23] Boris Lami cmu: Should we just make a piazza poll for this?
[23/02/2022, 17:36:31] Baby: Same
[23/02/2022, 17:37:03] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: that make sense thou
[23/02/2022, 17:37:19] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: we will be able to see the result at a glance
[23/02/2022, 17:37:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: instead of counting mails
[23/02/2022, 17:39:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: and someone already sending email changing mind
‎[23/02/2022, 17:40:23] Boris Lami cmu: ‎sticker omitted
[23/02/2022, 17:40:37] Boris Lami cmu: I wonder how many people more will change their mind
[23/02/2022, 17:41:41] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: can you run the Piazza post for us....so we can inform them to use that instead
[23/02/2022, 17:42:00] Boris Lami cmu: Sure, working on it
[23/02/2022, 17:45:34] Tiano: i think SP declined on the piazza poll
[23/02/2022, 17:45:51] Tiano: i guess he wants to leave room for change of mind.
[23/02/2022, 17:47:09] Boris Lami cmu: Oh I see
[23/02/2022, 17:47:20] Boris Lami cmu: Piazza Poll's has a revote policy though
[23/02/2022, 17:47:57] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: did he
[23/02/2022, 17:48:14] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I didnt hear say anything abt poll
[23/02/2022, 17:48:52] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: it was only the guy mentioning google form he told not to complicate things
[23/02/2022, 18:16:51] Tiano: thought i did
[23/02/2022, 18:17:01] Tiano: someone can check with him
[23/02/2022, 18:17:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Ok I can ask him via email
‎[25/02/2022, 08:38:58] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: ‎image omitted
[25/02/2022, 10:43:58] Boris Lami cmu: Let me process it
[25/02/2022, 10:55:20] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: ok boss
[25/02/2022, 10:55:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: thanks
[25/02/2022, 11:05:33] Boris Lami cmu: https://piazza.com/class/ky1m1qdahk32ex
[25/02/2022, 11:05:40] Boris Lami cmu: Done
[25/02/2022, 11:08:13] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Thanks
[25/02/2022, 11:09:04] Boris Lami cmu: 🤝
[25/02/2022, 11:31:22] Tiano: hey Boris,
for SparseMatrix, I think we have to give the students the altered multiplication formulae
[25/02/2022, 11:32:01] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: yeah
[25/02/2022, 11:32:19] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I remembered you guys telling us to change some lines of code
[25/02/2022, 11:32:32] Boris Lami cmu: 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 it's more fun if they figure it out nah
[25/02/2022, 11:33:02] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: lol
[25/02/2022, 11:33:08] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: ok allow them
[25/02/2022, 11:33:40] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Venant will
[25/02/2022, 11:34:35] Tiano: the one SP gave works, its just not optimized coz i tried with very optimized code and got 100. and i think with the copying tendencies some people are going to get code from last sem students. who already have the method
[25/02/2022, 11:34:52] Tiano: am asking because Venant already asked actually
[25/02/2022, 11:35:31] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: yeah he asked me in my OH yesterday
[25/02/2022, 11:35:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: so i told him he can make modification to it
[25/02/2022, 11:36:26] Tiano: but if they use an implementation similar to Bit Array, they wont need the modification.
[25/02/2022, 11:36:47] Tiano: I dont think we should let them struggle with it like this.
[25/02/2022, 11:36:59] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: thats if they know what BitArray is
[25/02/2022, 11:37:09] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: +1
[25/02/2022, 11:38:18] Tiano: anyway over to you @237673944178 and @250788947977
[25/02/2022, 11:38:49] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: their decision to make thou
[25/02/2022, 11:39:08] Tiano: correct
[25/02/2022, 11:39:39] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Yusuf is Missing In Action thou
[25/02/2022, 11:39:57] Tiano: meanwhile i have done autograder for assignment 5 but, i need ideas on implementation, the implementation I worked on is not giving full marks. So please go through it and advise me on any ideas.
[25/02/2022, 11:40:07] Tiano: happens when you take FSE
[25/02/2022, 11:41:58] Boris Lami cmu: Let's wait for red-black tree to come to past then confirm with SP if the hint should be shared
[25/02/2022, 11:42:28] Boris Lami cmu: @250784590341 , one more pray point.
[25/02/2022, 11:42:41] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: lol....he you should come try DL thou
[25/02/2022, 11:42:58] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: ok coool
[25/02/2022, 11:43:28] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: how far Boris give me the cheat code you re using to top the leaderboard
[25/02/2022, 11:43:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: help your fellow TA
[25/02/2022, 11:43:57] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: lol
[25/02/2022, 11:44:02] Boris Lami cmu: Wonderful, I didn't top leaderboard oh! shey I was in the first 100
[25/02/2022, 11:44:22] Boris Lami cmu: Around 60-80 for hw1
[25/02/2022, 11:44:32] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[25/02/2022, 11:44:52] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: that's still topping
[25/02/2022, 11:44:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: local topping
[25/02/2022, 11:47:43] Tiano: group renamed to DL toppers 🙃
[25/02/2022, 21:24:58] Tiano: if its a regular exam, maybe we suggest to do it diaml style 😂😂😂
[25/02/2022, 21:25:10] Tiano: thoughts?
[25/02/2022, 21:25:27] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Lockdown browser
[25/02/2022, 21:25:30] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Cool
[25/02/2022, 21:25:43] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: But sp normally say it is open book
[25/02/2022, 21:26:08] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Does open book also mean open Internet 🤔🤔
[25/02/2022, 21:33:16] Baby: As a linux user, I don't like lockdown browser. I don't know for mac, but it's not supported on ubuntu
[25/02/2022, 21:33:41] Boris Lami cmu: +1
[25/02/2022, 21:34:23] Baby: It there is a need to supervise them, they can come on campus
[25/02/2022, 21:34:31] Boris Lami cmu: All this Windows and Mac stuff 😫, ShareLink, Krisp, Lockdown browser, ...the list continues
[25/02/2022, 21:34:41] Baby: Also if it's open book, there is no need to supervise them
[25/02/2022, 21:35:05] Baby: Literally.
[25/02/2022, 21:35:32] Boris Lami cmu: I think in either cases, they should come to campus for exams for their safety.
[25/02/2022, 21:36:24] Baby: But you know that's something that is planned ahead. (Rooms and dates)
[25/02/2022, 21:39:15] Boris Lami cmu: SP can make this happen 😉
[25/02/2022, 21:39:24] Boris Lami cmu: If he wants to 😅
[25/02/2022, 22:00:44] Tiano: i meant them coming to campus
[26/02/2022, 15:22:59] Tiano: guys, this.
[27/02/2022, 11:14:15] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: oga Boris Good Morning Sir
[27/02/2022, 11:14:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: trust you are doing great
[27/02/2022, 11:14:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: so I tried to upload my SparseMatrix on gradescope and I had issue of disallowed detected in cpp
[27/02/2022, 11:14:17] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: i went back to check my code and your grader allowed header
[27/02/2022, 11:14:17] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: i see you are only allowing one header in the cpp file
[27/02/2022, 11:14:47] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: #include "SparseMatrix.h" this is the only you are allowing your cpp file
[27/02/2022, 11:17:41] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: for me I used regular expression to read my file and find pattern like () in the file,  so i included #include <regex> in code which was what i used back then and it worked
[27/02/2022, 11:18:16] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: i only three headers in cpp file: #include "SparseMatrix.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <regex>
[27/02/2022, 11:19:57] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: so i tried to test my code by adding this header in your allowed headers cpp and i reupload the autograder it was the same
[27/02/2022, 11:21:37] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I thought shud let you all know abt this, I returned the autograder back to the way it was
[27/02/2022, 11:22:09] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: kindly reupload your code and to ensure i didnt break anything. thanks
[27/02/2022, 11:24:56] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: this two lines of code in your run autograder is supposed to check the student headers against what you allowed right? grep "#include" "${STUDENT_CODE_PATH}SparseMatrix.h" >"${STUDENT_CODE_PATH}headersIn.hFile"
 grep "#include" "${STUDENT_CODE_PATH}SparseMatrix.cpp" >"${STUDENT_CODE_PATH}headersIn.cppFile"
[27/02/2022, 11:25:58] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: while didnt it still allowed when i added two headers to be allowed
[27/02/2022, 11:29:05] Boris Lami cmu: Good morning to everyone
[27/02/2022, 11:29:33] Boris Lami cmu: Do the sparse matrix instructions permit the use of these extra libraries?
[27/02/2022, 11:31:22] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: based on what Francis and Marie louise used to tell us back then so long as the headers you are including is not helping implement a DataStructure then you use it
[27/02/2022, 11:32:26] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I mean what  I added is just to readfile not like it is solving the problem for me
[27/02/2022, 11:32:31] Tiano: no i think we allowed you guys then
[27/02/2022, 11:32:36] Tiano: SP dont allow now
[27/02/2022, 11:32:50] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: okay
[27/02/2022, 11:32:59] Boris Lami cmu: Okay
[27/02/2022, 11:34:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: funny how i sent Sp my Sparse matrix code before becoming a TA
[27/02/2022, 11:36:00] Boris Lami cmu: This might be a bug in my code,  notwithstanding, I think it's not great to update an autograder someone put up without the person's notice.
[27/02/2022, 11:36:26] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: sorry about that
[27/02/2022, 11:36:41] Baby: Oga that was George not SP. We never user any more headerrs on our cohort
[27/02/2022, 11:37:04] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: was just testing, i took it back to the way it was
[27/02/2022, 11:42:29] Boris Lami cmu: Okay great. Hope my point went across.
[27/02/2022, 11:43:09] Boris Lami cmu: This code does what is required of it

[27/02/2022, 11:51:04] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: do you still have it there?? let me reupload it and see
[27/02/2022, 11:55:22] Boris Lami cmu: You mean the autograder you edited?
[27/02/2022, 11:55:59] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I thought you were testing it too by adding those lines
[27/02/2022, 11:56:26] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I see that it is back without those lines
[27/02/2022, 11:57:32] Boris Lami cmu: Nope
[27/02/2022, 11:57:46] Boris Lami cmu: I didn't upload any autograder today
[27/02/2022, 11:58:01] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: oh ok
[27/02/2022, 11:58:06] Boris Lami cmu: I downloaded what you edited here
[27/02/2022, 11:58:13] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I get
[27/02/2022, 11:58:30] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: is back to the way it was
[27/02/2022, 12:00:13] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I just wanted to see if the code will give me 100 just like the last one, but anyways we move.
[27/02/2022, 12:03:30] Boris Lami cmu: @2348092706568 , you can either update your code accordingly or let me know if you want to *temporarily* adapt the autograder to your code. 

I will encourage the former against the latter so that your score is comparable.
[27/02/2022, 12:04:59] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: no worries, when I have the time I will just the way I readfile instead
[27/02/2022, 12:05:38] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I mean i know the problem so is no big deal
[28/02/2022, 05:30:58] Boris Lami cmu: Red black tree is missing code templates 🌝 @250784590341 for similarity check
[28/02/2022, 05:31:09] Boris Lami cmu: Good morning guys
[28/02/2022, 05:37:20] Boris Lami cmu: I've emailed us all + SP with poll results so far
[28/02/2022, 07:23:00] Baby: The assignment is still ongoing, right? I will upload templates when the deadline has reached
[28/02/2022, 08:03:12] Boris Lami cmu: That's okay, makes sense.
[28/02/2022, 11:48:11] Baby: Hey TAs!
[28/02/2022, 11:48:38] Baby: Is there anyone who is comfortable with those time/space complexity thingies?
[28/02/2022, 11:48:51] Baby: Big O, Big theta,..
[28/02/2022, 11:49:13] Baby: If yes, would you do like a 1hour session with the students?
[28/02/2022, 11:49:57] Baby: Many people have been telling me that they need to discuss about them
[28/02/2022, 13:22:34] Tiano: not me
[28/02/2022, 13:44:33] Baby: Boris, Deji, Papy?
[28/02/2022, 13:45:18] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I cant take that on RN....superbusy with CMU wahala plus Interviews for Internship
[28/02/2022, 17:47:14] Boris Lami cmu: 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
[28/02/2022, 17:48:05] Boris Lami cmu: What does RN mean?
[28/02/2022, 17:48:22] Baby: Right now
[28/02/2022, 17:48:36] Boris Lami cmu: Thanks Marie
[28/02/2022, 17:48:50] Boris Lami cmu: Like how urgent?
[28/02/2022, 17:49:02] Baby: Before exams
[28/02/2022, 18:28:21] Boris Lami cmu: In person session?
[28/02/2022, 18:36:26] Boris Lami cmu: I think SP's email, as logical as always, is pretty reasonable now on the hw2 report thingy
[28/02/2022, 18:43:43] Baby: I don't get
[28/02/2022, 18:46:07] Boris Lami cmu: More like accepting the merging suggestion for comparable scores
[28/02/2022, 18:48:26] Baby: Did I see that mail?
[28/02/2022, 18:49:35] Boris Lami cmu: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?zx=a8ixqe3ff8tl#inbox/KtbxLvHXFDxWfgTtkpmqJLCpcCWKDKrSPg

[01/03/2022, 08:33:23] Boris Lami cmu: Thanks for the update ✌🏻
[01/03/2022, 08:54:11] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: I thought the extension is only supposed to be for Ian
[01/03/2022, 08:54:30] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Seems the extension is for everyone
[01/03/2022, 08:55:23] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Or you extended it for everyone
[01/03/2022, 10:48:56] yussuf Paapy cmu: It was for Ian but the Prof has made an announcement for everyone.
[01/03/2022, 10:49:04] yussuf Paapy cmu: Do we extend for everyone?
[01/03/2022, 10:49:24] yussuf Paapy cmu: Extended for Ian only
[01/03/2022, 10:50:06] yussuf Paapy cmu: I'm going to send an email to the professor for clarifications.
[01/03/2022, 10:50:15] yussuf Paapy cmu: What do u think guyz?
[01/03/2022, 11:39:22] Boris Lami cmu: It's okay to send
[03/03/2022, 12:21:00] Boris Lami cmu: Hey guys
[03/03/2022, 12:21:20] Boris Lami cmu: I just shared final feedback from Gradescope Help via email to all
[03/03/2022, 12:21:25] Boris Lami cmu: Ideas are welcome
[03/03/2022, 12:21:43] Tiano: i saw it
[03/03/2022, 12:22:30] Tiano: i think we can add a line that merges the two files in the autograder
[03/03/2022, 12:22:45] Tiano: i can test it over the weekend if you agree
[03/03/2022, 12:24:10] Boris Lami cmu: You mean like a 

cat file_1 file_2 > merged_file
[03/03/2022, 12:24:13] Boris Lami cmu: ?
[03/03/2022, 12:24:19] Tiano: yes
[03/03/2022, 12:24:34] Tiano: its a simple addition, actually anyone can do it
[03/03/2022, 12:25:07] Boris Lami cmu: Okay bro, not sure if I didn't experiment it well, I tried and it didn't work
[03/03/2022, 12:25:41] Tiano: which folder did you put it in?
[03/03/2022, 12:25:54] Tiano: i am not sure if its the submission folder
[03/03/2022, 12:25:55] Boris Lami cmu: cat code.h code.cpp > /autograder/submission/merged_code.h.cpp
[03/03/2022, 12:26:18] Tiano: we need to know the folder that similarity check works with
[03/03/2022, 12:26:19] Boris Lami cmu: Which folder then please?
[03/03/2022, 12:26:35] Tiano: gradescope team would tell us that
[03/03/2022, 12:29:32] Baby: I thought about this
‎[03/03/2022, 12:31:06] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[03/03/2022, 12:32:46] Tiano: maybe these files are copied into another folder by the similarity checker script
[03/03/2022, 12:32:49] Tiano: i have no idea
[03/03/2022, 12:49:11] Boris Lami cmu: Writing emails is painful sha, I think everything under the "Code" tab is sent to the similarity checker
‎[03/03/2022, 12:49:42] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[03/03/2022, 12:50:04] Tiano: either  way i will explore it over the weekend or if i get time
[03/03/2022, 12:50:36] Boris Lami cmu: Okay bro, keep us posted please.

[06/03/2022, 11:10:21] Tiano: there is a way you can ignore white spaces and empty lines with diff
[06/03/2022, 11:10:32] Tiano: i think diff  -w
[06/03/2022, 11:10:51] Tiano: you can read about it
[06/03/2022, 11:13:05] Boris Lami cmu: Yeah! I just reloaded the autograder that is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VhLlu6CBrLWzOg0HM1IJH32lBiFiH7kW/view
[06/03/2022, 11:14:28] Boris Lami cmu: Point is, if the autograder worked well for some time and suddenly failed for the aforementioned reason then something was changed by someone.
[06/03/2022, 11:15:16] Tiano: you mean one of us changed the autograder?
[06/03/2022, 11:19:58] Boris Lami cmu: Most probably.
[06/03/2022, 11:21:38] yussuf Paapy cmu: Lols, whoever did it should've communicated.
[06/03/2022, 11:43:18] Adedeji Adebayo cmu: Well I didn't touch it other than last time I mentioned here and I didn't even touch the autograder grader code I just added headers in the allowed header file that's all, what you have in your previous autograder is what I pushed back pls and I remove the headers, so maybe check what you did. Thanks.
[06/03/2022, 13:04:06] Baby: Hi guys. A student told me that his code has been flagged as having additional headers. But he didn't add them
[06/03/2022, 13:04:34] Baby: Not sure if you've solved it. He sent the message earlier but I just read it
[07/03/2022, 00:12:32] Boris Lami cmu: Probably same with the one on piazza, Venant I guess.
[07/03/2022, 00:12:42] Boris Lami cmu: It has been resolved.

[07/03/2022, 12:40:15] yussuf Paapy cmu: Reply guyz
[07/03/2022, 12:45:16] Boris Lami cmu: I have replied,

Mmaybe someone should ask if a slack day will be given today for students to resubmit with the combinecode.txt and the script for grading should be updated by @2348092706568 and @250784590341 to check for that the .h and .cpp match the combinecode.txt for each student before grading.
‎[07/03/2022, 12:52:08] Boris Lami cmu: ‎image omitted
[07/03/2022, 12:52:33] Tiano: am working on this
[07/03/2022, 12:52:43] Tiano: students dont need to resubmit
[07/03/2022, 12:53:08] Tiano: an autograder re run would do the job
[07/03/2022, 12:53:25] Boris Lami cmu: @2348092706568  😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
[07/03/2022, 12:53:49] Tiano: i think your question was confusing Boris
[07/03/2022, 12:54:08] Boris Lami cmu: Okay bro, this is excellent 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳, let us know once it's done.
[07/03/2022, 12:54:21] Tiano: all we need is the path which similarity checker uses to compare the files.
[07/03/2022, 12:55:04] Boris Lami cmu: 🌚🌚
[07/03/2022, 12:55:42] Boris Lami cmu: Okay, I'll ask as soon as I'm chanced
[07/03/2022, 12:56:27] Boris Lami cmu: @256784286046 , you know, re-running the autograder can take a 100 score to 96 nah 😬
[07/03/2022, 13:00:37] Tiano: yeah i do
[07/03/2022, 13:00:48] Tiano: we can re run a few of those manuallly
[07/03/2022, 13:00:57] Tiano: like one by one
[07/03/2022, 17:59:01] Tiano: sorry I forgot to reply, the copy is created, but it is not the folder that similarity checker uses
[07/03/2022, 17:59:31] Tiano: i sent the gradescope team a mail, lets see what they say
[07/03/2022, 22:52:04] yussuf Paapy cmu: Someone asked me if we are going to make a video explaining sparsematrix assignment?
[07/03/2022, 22:58:08] Boris Lami cmu: @2348092706568 🌝
[07/03/2022, 22:58:15] Boris Lami cmu: Okay bro
[07/03/2022, 22:59:21] Boris Lami cmu: @2348092706568 , looks like you've not replied yet. Might want to check this.
[08/03/2022, 19:57:16] Baby: Hey guys. I was gonna record the video for sparse matrix but our electricity is on and off tonight.
[08/03/2022, 19:57:25] Baby: Will do tomorrow.
[10/03/2022, 19:35:39] Baby: Hey guys!! Hope everyone is fine!
[10/03/2022, 19:36:15] Baby: I think we need to let the students with AIV know where they stand.
[10/03/2022, 19:37:22] Baby: I have met like 3 asking me where they stand because heard they have been flagged, and I would never take risk to say something before it's officially published
[10/03/2022, 20:32:04] Boris Lami cmu: They heard 👀👀👀👀👀
[10/03/2022, 20:32:18] Boris Lami cmu: Hey La Beauté
[10/03/2022, 20:32:48] Boris Lami cmu: Only the professor can give this go ahead
[10/03/2022, 20:42:16] Tiano: yeah, i was also thinking about it
[10/03/2022, 21:14:13] Baby: 😅
[10/03/2022, 21:14:19] Baby: So do we mail SP?
[11/03/2022, 12:32:36] Boris Lami cmu: 🌚🌚🌚 I won't be the one to write this email
[11/03/2022, 12:39:36] Tiano: did you guys see my mail last night?
[11/03/2022, 12:39:49] Tiano: i wil write it
[11/03/2022, 12:46:54] yussuf Paapy cmu: Yeap
[11/03/2022, 12:51:18] Boris Lami cmu: I did see your mail, more of a confirmation
[14/03/2022, 10:34:07] Tiano: hey @237673944178, i think you need to switch up gradescope to check for 3 files instead of 2.
[14/03/2022, 10:34:16] Tiano: before autograder runs👩‍👦‍👦 👨 ‍‍‍👨‍👩‍ 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👦👩👨 
[14/03/2022, 16:01:28] Boris Lami cmu: Sure, I'll update this tonight. Thanks man.
