As you all know our Facility Manager, Gowda is on sick leave from more than a week. *He was diagnosed with COVID-19 and has lung infection and other severe symptoms* . He was hospitalized on last Saturday and is now on ventilator support and he is recovering. We came to know from our vendor that, he is not covered under ESI/medical insurance as he had opted out earlier this year. 

His family is struggling financially with around 25k per day hospital expenses for ventilator, medicines etc. His mother also was diagnosed positive and is Isolated. His wife is currently managing things, but she also is symptomatic and waiting for her results. As per the doctor, Gowda require at least 5 more days of hospitalization to recover fully. They have tried to find a different hospital with lower cost but couldn’t really find with the current surge of cases.

In this tough situation we intend to provide financial support to meet his hospital expenses. All willing residents can contribute towards this as per individual capacity. Below are the details for making payment directly to his Gpay Number.

*Gpay: 28991825*
*Name: Dasara Gowda*

Please message me individually with the details of your contribution which would help us in maintaining the contribution tracker.

Expecting your whole-hearted support. Please remember *‘No amount is a less amount’.*

Thanks in advance.

21/04/21, 17:26 - Vijay: 🚩Dear All,

First of all, on behalf of the entire board, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of you, for your overwhelming response to support Gowda and his family. So far, I got confirmation from 41 of us. I’m sure there could be more contribution from those who wish to keep their support private. It’s not the amount but the act of care at difficult time like this make this invaluable. *We Agorians rock!!*🕺🏼✌🏼

Regarding Gowda’s update, we talked to his wife now. He is recovering and getting better. They are hoping to get him discharged by coming Friday. But today his wife also confirmed Covid positive and she is now in home isolation. Now his brother is taking care at hospital. Overall, we feel they are now in better situation than yesterday. Once again thanks each one of you for your generous contribution and support.

As part of our Covid-19 preventive action, we have planned a sanitization drive in common areas today through an external professional vendor.

They will be covering parking, all floor common areas and lifts. They are using approved disinfectant but residents are requested to take caution while touching and using non ventilated places like lifts immediately after the sanitization. We will switch off lifts for 30 minutes after sanitization. We will make sure one lift is available at any time. Also please make sure kids and pets are also not exposed to this disinfectant while they are doing the sanitization.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Since govt facilities are easily accessible and vaccines are now being available this can help the eligible people.

Rama, a daily labourer from Gorakhpur, met with a road accident in Bhatinda on 26th April.

Now he is struggling for life in Coma with head and leg injuries and won't survive if St Jabbar's hospital is not paid 2-3lakhs for further treatment.

His 18yr old son reached Bhatinda yesterday does not have any option but to see him die as he does not have this much money.

In this hard time, we are reaching out to everyone if you can help and save one life.

Even a small contribution from each family will be helpful if support is received from majority of people.

We are collecting money via Gpay, PayTM, PhonePe to (Varun).

Whatever amount we collect by tomorrow, we'll deposit it in St Jabbar's hospital for Rama's treatment.

Please donate and share this post. It might help save one life!

24/05/21, 22:57 - Vijay: 🚩🚩🚩Dear All, 
We have a new Covid Positive case confirmed in a flat in B Block floor. Source of infection is unknown, and all the family members are in isolation as per the medical advice. There are no primary contacts outside their family other than a domestic help. We identified a few other flats where this domestic help is going. We will be reaching out to them seperately.

Even if we are seeing a marginal dip in Covid cases in Bhatinda, the risk is not reduced to any degree and it’s extremely important to continue our vigil against it. We are still in lockdown and we still see a lot of people going out for various purposes. As we get every service home delivered, we request everyone to use such online services or home delivery services instead of visiting shops.

Any residents having any Covid-19 like symptoms, please don't neglect the same and needs to immediately reach out to any of board members or get themselves tested.

#StaySafe
25/05/21, 13:33 - Vijay: Just an update - We have done the common area sanitization including all floors today through an external vendor.

29/05/21, 14:01 - Vijay: 🚩🚩Hi All,

Cident Agora Apartment Owners Association (OCCAO) plans to conduct Covid-19 Vaccination Drive in our campus. This data collection is required to assess the demand from our residents community for vaccination for different age groups (18+ and others). It is open to all residents who need the first dose or second dose of Vaccines (depending on the availability). We don't have any confirmed leads yet, but the primary lead has the option of Covishield. As a first step we need to get an approximate count of interested residents for vaccination. We have created two google forms to collect the data 

*Form 1 - Enquiry Form* - Please fill this simple form first which contains your flat number and number of people interested in vaccination from your flat. Please complete this simple form as early as possible so that this allows us to get the demand in numbers quickly.

*Form 2 - Registration Form* - This form should be used for registering individual residents for the drive. You have to fill this multiple times if there are more than one eligible people in your flats. *We will share the Registration Form shortly after we get the response on the enquiry form.* 

 *All the vaccine and eligibility related info available in the form itself* and you can reach out to us for more questions.

29/05/21, 19:52 - Vijay: Welcome Anuraag
29/05/21, 22:18 - Anuraag: Thanks Brijesh for Adding👍
29/05/21, 23:16 - Rigo: <Media omitted>
29/05/21, 23:18 - Rigo: It’s great initiative and I really appreciate. However just wondering if we are buying the dose from private hospital
30/05/21, 08:24 - Sabeena: Form ??
30/05/21, 08:39 - Vijay: We are trying with Pvt hospitals. That's the only possibilities to conduct such drives.
30/05/21, 08:41 - Vijay: It's a Google form mentioned in the above message
30/05/21, 08:41 - Vijay: 👆
30/05/21, 08:42 - Sabeena: Ok thanks
30/05/21, 08:49 - Vijay: 🚩A gentle reminder. So far we have received 33 responses with a total number of 66 people. Any interested residents please fill this enquiry form quickly.
30/05/21, 09:26 - Dhrishti: If it’s with private hospital then they will manage the vaccination as well as storage / handling of vaccine ??
30/05/21, 09:28 - Dhrishti: 33 respondents means approximately 33 flats..

They can visit each flat rather that queue in the open place to avoid compromising on social distancing norms..
30/05/21, 09:32 - Paan Singh: That will not be a feasible option for the hospital staff as they need to update the database etc for which they require access to laptop etc.

Moreover having them roam around in campus will be risk for others. Let association work with them on feasible options..
30/05/21, 09:33 - Vijay: We are only facilitating this. All the vaccine related process and protocols will be carried out by the service provider/hospital. They have thier own requirement for such drives like minimum number, common facilities to conduct such drives etc. Services like visiting individual appartment etc is something nobody is providing. This enquiry excercise will allow us the demand from outside so that we can talk to a few leads we currently have and arrive on possible options.
30/05/21, 09:34 - Vijay: From *ourside
30/05/21, 09:39 - Ravisri: 👍👍 Just done with the form filling part
30/05/21, 11:57 - Dr. Saab: Hi all...no harm in inviting service providers at home...
They have been instructed to take adequate precautions..and we are all vaccinated with the second dose also now
30/05/21, 12:00 - Dr. Saab: Only to take care..that who all are done with the first dose and going for the second dose ..please go for the same vaccine

Covidsheild to go for 2 nd also of Covidsheild

Covaxin should go for second dose of Covaxin
30/05/21, 12:03 - Dr. Saab: If we are going to give them a common area for vaccination in the campus...
Please all residents are wearing N 95 mask and  maintaining adequate social distancing
30/05/21, 12:04 - Dr. Saab: I would want to volunteer the drive ..if I am available at the time of the service
30/05/21, 12:05 - Dr. Saab: Take care all🙏🏼
30/05/21, 12:24 - Vijay: Thanks Dr. We will soon share the update

01/06/21, 21:27 - Vijay: 🚩🚩🚩We have a situation. Our both domestic water pumps are not working, and we are running low on domestic water. Team is trying to arrange a temporary motor from other sites, but not yet successful. In worst case we should only be able fix this tomorrow morning. So, request everyone to use domestic water conservatively and not waste so that we can manage it till tomorrow morning. We will keep you posted on this.
01/06/21, 22:12 - Jay Poval: This message was deleted
01/06/21, 23:46 - Abhi Pebb: Any update on when water will come to B block?
01/06/21, 23:46 - Abhi Pebb: There's absolutely no water in any of the taps n it's very difficulty
01/06/21, 23:52 - Jay Poval: Tomorrow morning
01/06/21, 23:59 - Vijay: We are still working to arrange some temporary options. We will give an update tomorrow morning.
02/06/21, 06:55 - Vijay: 🚩Update - We have temporarily managed to fill some water in our over head tanks from our other primary overhead fire water tanks. We should be able to manage it till noon and meanwhile we need to get a 10hp motor as a standby to pump the water up as well as to get the damaged pumps (submersible pumps) out of water for repair. Looks like getting a 10hp pump is not easy esp with the lockdown restrictions and we are still trying for some leads. *So please use the water very conservatively so that we should manage untill we get a stand by pump.* Water will be available soon.
02/06/21, 06:58 - Vijay: Also anyone has contacts with motor rental services or any other contacts who can arrange a temporary 10hp pump, please share with us. Thanks for your cooperation.
02/06/21, 07:05 - Vijay: 🚩 *A word of caution about the water from fire water tank* . Even if the water in the fire water tanks is fresh (Our water tanks design is - first  the water gets pumped to the fire water tanks and from there water will overflow to original domestic over head tanks), these tanks are not cleaned regularly as our domestic tanks. So please boil the water before drinking and cooking purposes.
02/06/21, 07:41 - Sudabha: Thank you team for your efforts. I know it is not easy to get required motor especially during this lockdown time..
02/06/21, 07:42 - Dr. Saab: Brijesh if we have water purifiers installed  at home..yet to boil the water purifier is recommended?
02/06/21, 07:44 - Dr. Saab: Vijay..what I mean is , can we use the water from water purifier directly without boiling
02/06/21, 07:44 - Vijay: The water is from our borewell only but its better to boil to be on the safer side.
02/06/21, 07:44 - Amrish: I personally called couple of vendors on Varthur roads but they are not picking. Appreciate your efforts in these conditions
02/06/21, 07:45 - Dr. Saab: Ok thanks

Even if repair work is going on, in case of a delay we will have water for immediate use.
02/06/21, 13:31 - Vijay: 🚩Update 3 - The latest time committed by motor repair guy is 6PM today. Request everyone to use the water judiciously and avoid any usage like washing machines etc so that we can manage till 6PM.
02/06/21, 18:32 - Monk: Is it done now?
02/06/21, 19:38 - Vijay: 🚩Update 4 - We got one of our motors repaired and is now running from last 2 hours. The Over head tanks are now getting filled. The second motor will be repaired and fixed tomorrow. As of now, we returned to normal. 

A big shout out to our support team members (Electrician, STP operator, Security team) who worked yesterday whole night for those temporary arrangements.

06/07/21, 04:39 - Dr. Saab: Good morning all !
Vijay and all the members of association..sorry if I am putting a not so relevant agenda / matter here , as ideally this matter has to be posted in our  Agora Darbar gr ...

But found this important ..as we are all coming out of the lockdown finally..and hopefully not to go back into it again..but of course ,if we all behave and live sensibly ..even house arrest would do wonders for our physical and mental haelth !
06/07/21, 04:41 - Dr. Saab: So with all due respect to the rules and regulations to the admin s  here ..pls allow me to violate it ..only for my this post please 🙏🏼
06/07/21, 04:50 - Dr. Saab: Hi all
As we all are coming out of the lockdown...

The year or rather more than a year that passed by was not at all easy for anybody...
It called for an emergency...

An Urgent .. dismantling of our way of life ..the routine what we were following for years now ..
Guys trust me , that was not easy for each one of us..with demand of an urgent adjustment and maitainance peace 
Within the nation
Within the society
Within the community 
Within the family
And the most important within oneself..
And most of us here have to take care our parents and our children.. therefore taking care of oneself ( including mental and physical health), inculcating positivity in behaviour and  remaining happy in these uncertain times had to be made a priority for nothing else ..but only to survive...
06/07/21, 04:57 - Dr. Saab: Trust me guys ...
It was a war like situation...and the humanity was put on test by nature in the name of pandemic after almost a 💯 years now! ( The last was Spanish flu in 1918 )...

So one can imagine... there was no guidance or rather no wise men is alive  of that era( 1918 ) to give advice on how to cope...

Humankind was Left with no choice but..each one on their own and the survival of the fittest !
As life changed from a routine to a war like situation overnight !
06/07/21, 04:59 - Dr. Saab: And trust me..as caretakers of the health of the masses ..
The health care workers..we were also not spared by the mother nature..
Infact it was a double challenge for us .
We had to take care of our family ..but as a first priority our patients and their families !!
06/07/21, 05:01 - Dr. Saab: It's not that we are complaining ..it was a previledge indeed to be blessed to be the chosen one to serve the human kind 🙏🏼
06/07/21, 05:03 - Dr. Saab: But health care workers are also human too..
We also have physical ailments ..our mental health was taken for a toss..most important was..we all also had a family too...
Coming back home from work was as good as carrying the infection home to our family.. !
06/07/21, 05:08 - Dr. Saab: Yes . Now I can tell ..
Things have changed for us also..most of us took this as a challenge..and have evolved or rather are on the process of evolving..as, if giver is not full,  what he can distribute ?...
So nature taught us being happy  and positive is a choice ..
It's not that this state of mind would change the present situation but definitely it helps to cope the situation better ...
Can create a joyous environment in the workplace and family ..!!
06/07/21, 05:10 - Dr. Saab: Therefore guys.. with this new lesson learnt and enforced..let's face this COVD 19 together ..as we all are in it ..!!

07/07/21, 18:05 - Vijay: 🚩🚩 *Important - Fire door Usage*
Hi All, 
As you all know our big red door in each floor, which is known as fire door, is a passive fire safety system, protecting buildings from the spread of fire by confining it to a specific area for a longer period of time. This allows people within the building enough time to escape via alternative routes such as staircases which might otherwise be blocked by fire. While these are a legal requirement for high rise buildings like us, the prime purpose for fire doors is to save lives and stop the spread of a destructive fire. 

*Usage* – To make Fire doors work as passive fire safety system, the doors needs to be auto closed always. Keeping it open using some stones/blocking objects, make this safety system fail as well as damage the doors and its auto closing mechanism.

*Current condition of our fire doors* – We identified around 24 doors across three blocks which are damaged and not working as intended. The damage is mainly due to doors kept open for long period using stones or blocking objects. We have now fixed these 24 doors which required welding, reshaping etc. and in the process of replacing the auto closer system which are not currently working.

*Request to Residents* –  Residents tend to keep the doors open in few floors due to low lighting, door rattling etc. We are trying to address these issues. After fixing the door damages and auto stopper issues we expect the ratting issue to get resolved. For low lit areas, we are planning to get provision to get the floor light switched on as needed.

So, *under no situation, residents shall keep the fire doors open*. As mentioned, keeping the doors opened will damage the doors as well as fail the passive fire safety system. If you find any door in your floor has issues, do reach out to our facility manager to get it fixed.

Expecting everyone's support on this.

07/07/21, 19:12 - Lui: I think some prop the door with stones because when it is windy the door keeps banging against the frame over and over again.
07/07/21, 19:15 - Lui: And not everyone is aware that the doors get damaged when kept this way or understand the need to keep the door closed.

05/08/21, 11:46 - Vijay: 🚩🚩🚩Dear All, 
We have a new Covid Positive case confirmed in a flat in C Block 8th floor. The person has a travel history and there are no primary contacts. 

It's important that all interstate returning and travelling residents need to self-isolate themselves for a week and get tested if there are any possibilities of infection or Covid-19 like symptoms. Also, it’s mandatory for all residents returning from other states should inform the board via email cidentAgora@gmail.com.

Even if we are witnessing low Covid cases in Bhatinda, the risk is still out there and it’s extremely important to continue our vigil against it with safety measures like face masks, social distancing, frequent hand washing, and early testing of any symptoms. 

#StaySafe

14/08/21, 10:03 - Vijay: 🚩🚩Hi All,

We have recently received many complaints about dog owners not taking care of dogs in the campus responsibly. Off late lot of dog poops in our garden/play area and on the Agora/Kiata road. Also, there are a few cases reported where kids got dog bites while playing with pet dogs. 

All dog owners, please follow the instructions clearly.

*1.	Keep your dogs out of Kids play area and Garden* – Avoid bringing the dogs near kids and kids play area/garden. Even trained dogs get excited playing with kids and there is always possibility of getting bites and scratches to kids. Always accompany your pets and keep them on leash when you take them out of your home. To ensure safety, parents should accompany if kids are taking dogs out as you cannot expect kids to follow the rules.

*2.	Clean it up* - Residents owning pets shall ensure that they clean the place immediately, if their pet ends up pooping in a common area including roads. Always carry tissue/newspapers to collect the poop in case the pet poops in a common area.

*3.	Train your pet & Vaccinate*: Ensure you give your pet ample obedience training, so the dog does not behave untowardly in common areas or gets provoked when amidst other kids or residents. All vaccinations must be administered on a timely basis and pet owners should keep the vaccination record.

*Owning a dog is a joy, privilege, but a big responsibility also*
14/08/21, 10:07 - Suhas: 👍🏻
14/08/21, 10:07 - Anand VC: Thanks for information 👍🙏
14/08/21, 10:08 - Prakumar: 👍👍
14/08/21, 10:11 - Dhrishti: I have seen a few of them Agora/Kiata taking their dog just outside the Main gate for nature calls.

Pooping is only advisable in designated toilets..

Let’s all be equally responsible for our Residential areas as well as Public areas..

Govt is not going to come n collect dog poop on your behalf..

If you wish to owe a dog then ensure they are very well trained and such activities are done within apartment boundaries..

This is being said in general public interest and not to hurt sentiments of dog owners..
14/08/21, 10:13 - Jam Sher: 👍👍
14/08/21, 10:15 - Vijay: Valid point. I believe dog owners will take that in the right way.

15/08/21, 08:44 - Aslam: Happy independence day...
15/08/21, 11:23 - Sudabha: Did you know?
On 15th August, on India's Independence Day, the *tricolour*, our national flag is "hoisted", whereas on the 26th January, that is, on our Republic Day, it is "unfurled". 

What is the difference between hoisting the flag and unfurling the same? 

Well, on 15th August, the flag is kept folded, down at the middle of the flag pole, and is pulled up at the tip of the pole before it is spread out. This is hoisting of a flag. It signifies the country was freed after a span of colonial domination. 

On the other hand, on 26th January (since 1950) the tricolour is unfurled, that is, the flag stays high up at the tip of the flag pole, (not at the middle or lower height of the pole) folded,  and is spread out with the pull of the rope. This is unfurling of the tricolour. It signifies that as a flag of an already free country, it cannot stay hung at a lower height, but is held high above. 

This is a small but very significant aspect of how our tricolour is honoured with the country's history...
Jai Hind... 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!🇮🇳

25/08/21, 09:33 - Ahir Thimma: Looks like a very bad accident just outside our gate
25/08/21, 09:47 - Preeti: Yes ..one perosn died on the spot ..
25/08/21, 09:48 - Sarasa: Oh that's sad
25/08/21, 09:48 - Preeti: Family people of the person now blocking road ...police not yet arrived ..
25/08/21, 09:50 - Dhrishti: Any clues on what happened 
Was the deceased person hit by vehicle or is it was accident between vehicles..
25/08/21, 09:54 - Dhrishti: It would be good to install bumpers 20m ahead on either side of road with ZEBRA crossing for people from Cident Agora/Kiata to cross the road..

Maybe speak to local authorities to make this happen..
25/08/21, 09:58 - Shubha: The advertisement billboards installed in the divider between the two roads is the biggest problem for pedestrians trying to cross the road. When you stand at the divider is difficult to see vehicles coming as it blocks view.
25/08/21, 09:59 - Shubha: We residents must lobby so that the advertisement panels are removed from at least a small stretch in front of our gate so that we can safely cross.
25/08/21, 10:24 - Suman: Was the person from Agora or Kiata?

When we had come 1.5yrs back, a bulb from our gate was removed and got stolen too...

12/09/21, 21:09 - Vijay: 🚩🚩🚩Dear All,

We have a new Covid Positive case confirmed in a flat in A Block. There are no symptoms but confirmed by the RTPCR test took for a travel requirement. The positive person is a kid and the parent tested negative. There is no travel history and the source of infection is unknown. All the family members are in isolation as per the medical advice. 

There are no primary contacts outside their family other than a domestic help. We are identifying the other flats where this domestic help is going. We will be reaching out to them separately.

Any residents especially kids having any Covid-19 like symptoms, please don't neglect the same and needs to isolate themselves and get tested. Parents need to watch out for kids’ exposure risk as kids are the ones left without vaccination currently.

Even if we are witnessing low Covid cases in Bhatinda, the risk is still out there and it’s extremely important to continue our vigil against it with safety measures like face masks, social distancing, frequent hand washing, and early testing of any symptoms. 

#StaySafe

19/09/21, 09:11 - Kali Nag: I feel the association should get a proper plumber and electrician. After paying such a high maintenance if this type of service we get it is really ridiculous.
19/09/21, 09:13 - Kali Nag: It seems the plumber has no fixed time of coming to the apartment. When there is an urgent work to be done  we have to keep waiting for the plumber till 1o'clock.but not sure whether he will come that time  also.
19/09/21, 09:13 - Kali Nag: We have to stop all our work and keep waiting for him and pray for his arrival.
19/09/21, 09:15 - Namitha: Agreed, he didn't even take my call day before . I haven't seen him around as well.. We need someone who atleast knows the job and is reliable
19/09/21, 09:19 - Kali Nag: He takes off on Wednesday  and Sunday according to his wish he will come.
19/09/21, 09:20 - Kali Nag: If we have to get plumber from outside why should we pay such a high maintenance.
19/09/21, 10:20 - Diya: Same here...my bathroom is clogged and bath water is getting blocked ..I called him for checking it ..he is telling me I cannot check becoz bathroom pipe is so deep I cannot put hand or neither I have any thing to check....I told then wat is ur use of u here...?? He straight away went ..saying I cannot do..😏
19/09/21, 10:20 - Diya: True
19/09/21, 10:20 - Ratna: 👍👍 last 6 months found the current plumber to be useless...created more trouble then resolving the issues...fully agree we should hire a professional plumber who knows his job well..
19/09/21, 10:30 - Namitha: The fact that many residents have a complaint shows his incompetence.  And this isn't the first time we are bringing it up. Request association to please look into getting a professional crew or even one proper person for this type of electrical /plumbing work
19/09/21, 10:34 - Laxmi Saj: Flush water is stinking very bad. Request if something can be done for this issue

22/09/21, 22:01 - Vijay: 🚩🚩Hi All,

Quick update on the Tank cleaning and Borewell issues we faced yesterday –

Firstly, we thank all for your patience and support on this issue.

As mentioned yesterday we ran into unexpected issues with our borewell where we were not able to pump the water to our underground tank which caused delays in pumping water up and we had to get water tankers outside to manage the situation. Also, there was delay in distributing the water due to the way we have connected all overhead tanks and it took some time to figure out the valve configuration to manage this efficiently. 

Today we have got a borewell team to lift our motor and pipe and luckily the issues were limited to damaged pipe and team has fixed the pipe and our borewell is now back to normal. Thanks to everyone especially the residents who helped us with borewell issues.

Tomorrow we are planning to complete the pending A block tank cleaning, starting around 11 AM.
22/09/21, 22:06 - Pill G: Thanks for immediate solution of bore well iilssue.

24/09/21, 10:31 - Abhi Pebb: Why dont we let the water drain? We're anyway not using it
24/09/21, 10:38 - Kali Nag: It may turn to breeding place of mosquitoes.
24/09/21, 10:38 - Kali Nag: Then dengue and malaria  will start.
24/09/21, 10:39 - Namitha: the water could be reused for gardening instead of draining, if it won't harm the plants.
24/09/21, 10:39 - Namitha: *some part of it.
24/09/21, 11:03 - Vijay: We will be cleaning this up soon, also there are a few maintenance to be completed as well. We cannot keep this empty as tiles will break with heat.

24/09/21, 17:10 - Johnney: I have not understood the rational behind selecting a pool facing house? 🤔🤔🤔 many people want their house to be pool facing.
24/09/21, 17:12 - Johnney: Also builders sell houses at a premium saying it is pool facing...
24/09/21, 17:23 - Monk: Its all about view Johnney, like you might have heard sea facing flats in Mumbai, this was the short form of that😱😄
24/09/21, 17:29 - Ratna: 🤪😜Besides, pool facing, garden facing or amenities facing provide enough breathing space for you to look around when standing in your balcony or viewing outside your bedroom window
24/09/21, 17:40 - Monk: 😄😄😄
24/09/21, 18:06 - Suhas: Mumbai kind of expectations in Bhatinda and that's also from a Cident property, accept my salute 😊
