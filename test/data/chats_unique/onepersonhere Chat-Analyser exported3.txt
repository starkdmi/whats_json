01/07/2020, 21:03 - Aditya: Basically run from the training shed near SCS
All the way straight take a left, all the way straight till you see path you can U-turn, it's a wide u-turn
And run back to training shed
01/07/2020, 21:08 - Illays: We ran non-stop for 2.2km in over 12 minutes
01/07/2020, 21:08 - Illays: The actual ippt though, I ran non-stop for bout 800m
01/07/2020, 21:09 - Aditya: Oh this is the one my batch ran during the great ippt of March 2019
01/07/2020, 21:09 - +65 9712 9477: Different, because you had to do statics before running during the actual test
01/07/2020, 21:09 - Illays: Yeah. Next time for training, we should try doing statics and then going for 2.4.
01/07/2020, 21:10 - Illays: I gassed real hard that day
01/07/2020, 21:10 - +65 9712 9477: A bit hard to simulate, because changed the way push ups and situps are assessed

01/07/2020, 21:23 - Chuan zhe: Should have I think
01/07/2020, 21:23 - Chuan zhe: Thanks bro
02/07/2020, 09:45 - Illays: Eh guys can someone open PLC auditorium
02/07/2020, 09:47 - Illays: Sorry for the last minute information.
02/07/2020, 09:51 - Illays: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 09:52 - Illays: We need to check how we missed out this guy's booking...
02/07/2020, 10:08 - Wh: Probably impromptu email
02/07/2020, 10:16 - Illays: If so, only Linus can access.  Maybe we should start booking using whatsapp instead...
02/07/2020, 10:33 - Wh: Cannot
02/07/2020, 10:33 - Wh: Email must be official
02/07/2020, 10:41 - Illays: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 10:41 - Illays: Outfield is different usually it's done via email because of the 'covert' nature of it.
02/07/2020, 10:43 - Illays: But for booking of venues, I think whatsapp could be a better alternative unless we can access the outlook email outside of the intranet which isn't the case right now.
02/07/2020, 10:49 - Wh: I think its best to follow what @6598753315 does later audit easier to show the records
02/07/2020, 10:50 - You changed the group description
02/07/2020, 10:52 - Illays: I think auditors would be more interested in the accounting of equipments than booking of venues?

09/08/2020, 23:03 - Wee Siang: Hahaha
11/08/2020, 08:49 - Illays: Anyways guys the main projector is working now, but we set up the spare projector at the front row just in case the main one malfunctions. Don't dismantle the spare one, I think we'll just leave it there until we get the main one fixed.
11/08/2020, 09:03 - Faheem: team B, friday chief supply coming to visit our base fyi
11/08/2020, 09:04 - Faheem: together with FSM

11/08/2020, 09:56 - Wh: I think we have event

11/08/2020, 11:42 - Wh: For a long time
11/08/2020, 11:43 - Wh: And ensure no one is in LH
11/08/2020, 11:57 - Samuel: Call FMA
11/08/2020, 11:58 - Illays: Ya I just did. The lady asked me where leaders hall is and I'm like u must be jokin. But I told her the block number anyway hope they can get it fixed.
11/08/2020, 12:09 - Wh: FMA can't solve everything
11/08/2020, 12:13 - Illays: I have that feeling when she asked 'ah where's leader's hall. You find the block number then call me back' but nvm give them the benefit of the doubt
11/08/2020, 12:16 - Illays: Also the main projector didn't break down. Basically the vent is taped up to make sure the connection is tight so that fixed it.
11/08/2020, 12:17 - Illays: They also dismantled the spare projector coz I was at LH so if you guys plan on setting up in the future, just take the portable audio rack cover in the control room and lay it flat on top of the middle of third row seats. And then place the spare projecter on it.
11/08/2020, 12:23 - Wh: What?
11/08/2020, 12:24 - Illays: Basically use the rack cover as a platform for the projector.
11/08/2020, 12:25 - Illays: Place it on the third row
11/08/2020, 12:25 - Illays: This is just for contingency if the main one breaks down

14/08/2020, 07:51 - Wh: To add on: whatever directive ilyas said are false examples of what a military law is like
14/08/2020, 07:52 - Illays: I see you're ready to use pebbles to wipe urself

17/08/2020, 18:24 - Illays: And then they will commence with the actual event.
17/08/2020, 18:27 - Illays: There will be a colonel coming in to sispec tmr. Just make sure the projector vent cover is sealed properly and you may reinforce with more masking tape so it doesn't break down.
17/08/2020, 18:53 - Chuan zhe: Ok
17/08/2020, 18:54 - Illays: Ahm the sispec projector is very unpredictable. Just broke down then hate to tape the thing up again and adjust cable idk wat.
17/08/2020, 18:54 - Illays: I suggest tmr 2 guys in sispec if possible.
17/08/2020, 18:55 - Illays: And once projector is turned off and you wanna start it up again, it'll take 3 minutes to fully boot up.
17/08/2020, 18:58 - Wee Siang: up till now still no change? ask mr jayden to replace the projector

I will also like to express my special thanks to Gin Teck, Aloysius, Chuan Zhe, for giving me such good companionship and encouragement. I was quite unaware of my surroundings when I first posted in, Aloysius and Gin Teck never left me alone, they did their best to give me the guidance and emotional support I needed. Chuan Zhe has really been a good and trustworthy person for me to talk to, in fact I wished he was in team A with me hahaha. Time always flies past when I am with your, and your are one of the few whom I could talk my heart out to, I always enjoyed doing things with your, even if it's something I do not really like. Your would forever be my best friends, and I am saying this with all my heart.

11/11/2020, 18:24 - Illays: You may take a look at the new oil records spreadsheet. There's OILs for good performance, may come under 'events duty'. Rest day OIL before outfields are not counted inside.

On another note, now only 1 guy is assigned for events but if you want to join, you may go ahead but if the event ends late and there's 5 people doing the event. Only the assigned guy + 1 more person can claim the off. 

Also, for events now you can see the time if not the POC. So if it starts late or the POC informs you it starts late and you want to go for hls and keep fit like @6593678650 , then you may do so. If not then you may take hideout at the event venue.

Also if you intend to chill at the event venue, try to shut the main auditorium AC and use the AC at the control room instead so the AC can last longer, or go to VIP room or our own office. Because right now the LH ac isn't working, plc and sispec are deteriorating.

For leaving early after events, just go ahead as it doesn't make sense for you guys to come back. Anything, just tell the spec that event ended early if you come across them. And that you've informed the signal wing group or just pm one of us so when they ask we'll say you left straight from the venue.

Lastly, try to keep our new office neat and tidy @6593678650 @6587930426 @6592348617

08/03/2021, 21:13 - Qalbi: Aye no prob
08/03/2021, 21:17 - +65 9652 7262: last Friday we going book out early at like 3-3.30. He called me after mid rc to go to officer mess, igts and cs2 to count all the stores in TTI sheet. Firstly last fucking min came up with this ask us to do, I told him we no manpower also , I‚Äôm the only senior currently in the afternoon so I cannot spilt the work, I cannot possibly go all 3 places. Especially cs2 if I count everything in there need whole day alr. He reply ‚Äòno no can do one just go do I need it by today put on my table. Then Monday I see.‚Äô 

Sat he called me. Asking me to check the laundry see have enough to support thiagu. Eh u think I no life ah why u think I in camp now. I said I today go store see need double confirm, he didn‚Äôt reply. Classic 

Today morning I start work at 645, after that I go to LH to clear 100+ chairs and table. The chairs are all one by one never stack up and the fella say he no manpower to help. I never tell Vinod cause I‚Äôm pretty sure by the time he complains and all I‚Äôve stack finished alr. Weixin qalbi and klush help me and fucking tiring tbh. 

I want go office I want rest alr. Vinod come in say today we‚Äôll finish all the snapcheck by today. Cookhouse 1,2&3 , tradoc, our block lvl 2 and medical centre. All to be done in afternoon. last time we do 2-3 place max per day lol me and Fahim just suck it up. That indian want to tag alone to show the new Sgt how we do. Usually we‚Äôll get someone from the place to help us but since he there he 1 by 1 check we fucking slow progress. Then he say y‚Äôall so slow how to finish? Erm cause that amount already cannot finish one?! At medical center he talking to a ME3 while we trying to find a medic to help us. He come to me and start slapping my clipboard gangster like that say faster do stop wasting time. Wah cb I swear I almost punch him Fahim hold me back.
After last rc today he tell all cs2 stay back to go LH, officer mess and igts with him and new Sgt so that he can do hand over take over cause no time alr he this week leaving. Everyone pissed as shit sia he no time management then play these kind of shit
08/03/2021, 21:17 - +65 9652 7262: But end up never do also make us stay back in office waste time. Most probably tmr stay back and do
08/03/2021, 21:17 - +65 9652 7262: Also snapcheck we managed to complete but the audit said only can generate 3 places per day. Look how many places we did today üôÇ also there‚Äôs no neutral today to sign (only Sgt siti Edmund simon and tng) guess who gonna get fuck next audit
08/03/2021, 21:17 - +65 9652 7262: He ask me to call Qalbi come office jn as he‚Äôs the logistics ic after wenhan. But I know qalbi and klush doing event cause I there mah and if I not wrong both sispec and LH have something? I told him Qalbi cannot come office now he legit doing event. Sgt he good, say ‚Äò so then I do ah I don‚Äôt care ask him come‚Äô
08/03/2021, 21:17 - +65 9652 7262: I said like 3 times Qalbi did the check alr it‚Äôs on the cabinet we‚Äôll go check. He say no cannot I want him to come and idc what event this one I go check for him ah
