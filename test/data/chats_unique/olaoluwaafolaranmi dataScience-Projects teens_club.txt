12/04/2021, 19:28 - +234 705 536 9106: Peter Drury,one of the most celebrated commentators in football history has been described as an absolute genius when it comes to football Commentry.
His mastery of the english language,use of literary devices and ability to form new words have always made him a joy to listen to.
Though an accountant by profession and an ADHD patient,this had not limited him in any way as he continues to spice up football with his hilarious Commentry.
What are your favorite Peter Drury moments?
Here are some iconic commentaries of Peter Drury the best Premier League commentator.
1— 10 points clear in the English Premier League, the City in Manchester have distanced themselves from those who claimed to be united, the title contenders have been separated from the title pretenders.
2— Jesus Levels for City and cancels Mohammed Salah's opener, looks like to me the game is turning religious.
3— Roma has risen from ruins, Manolas the Greek god in Rome. The unthinkable unfolds before our eyes, this was not meant to happen, this is happening. Francesco does not know where to go, Iniesta does not know where to look.
4— When you look at Messi you wonder If it's the same football that troubles Lingard.
5— Liverpool benefited from Covid-19 to win the Premier League and now that vaccines are out, they are back to normal.
6— Right there you've got two midfielders battling it out for glory and stardom, you look at Thomas Partey and you see he's ready to party but you look at Pogba and it seems he's here to sweep after the party is over.
7— The Lamp in Lampard is off and Stamford Bridge is in darkness.
8— David Luis is more of Pandemic to Arsenal than Corona virus.       👌👌

25/04/2021, 21:35 - Nonso: It’s something that’ll be Unisex.
25/04/2021, 21:37 - Nonso: Please let’s also be cautious of the material we’re using in making it and a really dope blue.

25/04/2021, 21:44 - Nonso: 💪🏽
25/04/2021, 21:44 - Raven: There was a time some designs were sent in for members to pick and we all agreed on this particular one
25/04/2021, 21:44 - @chriswill: Why? 🙂
25/04/2021, 21:44 - Raven: Too many
25/04/2021, 21:45 - Raven: Those of you that want other colours, are you planning on opening a new society?

25/04/2021, 21:47 - @fadu: Rii
25/04/2021, 21:48 - Raven: The polo is more better than tshirt
25/04/2021, 21:49 - @fadu: Let's cast ballots the
25/04/2021, 21:49 - Nonso: <Media omitted>
25/04/2021, 21:49 - Nonso: <Media omitted>
25/04/2021, 21:49 - Raven: For tshirts we cants use monograms because it will make it look rough 

Polos are thicker and stronger and will look much more better with the color combination
25/04/2021, 21:49 - @fadu: Then**
25/04/2021, 21:50 - Raven: Bro 

When I mix the two colors for polo and tshirt you will be forced to go with a polo
25/04/2021, 21:50 - Raven: If it was plain no prob5
25/04/2021, 21:51 - Raven: Making a tshirt with another colour attached to the sleeves will make it look feminine
25/04/2021, 21:52 - +234 909 655 7414: Yep
25/04/2021, 21:52 - @collins: This isn't as easy to maintain
25/04/2021, 21:53 - @sophia: What about that our round neck
Is it DVD
Can’t remember
25/04/2021, 21:53 - Raven: Which ?
25/04/2021, 21:53 - +234 901 249 3262: It all depends on the material na...you don't even need to add too many colours there fr...Round necks (T-shirts) are more mature in this age frs...and are way...Comfy?
25/04/2021, 21:54 - Nonso: You all have a point. Well I feel we should do sample designs of the two styles in mind and the group picks  which is best. 🤷🏽‍♂️ my opinion
25/04/2021, 21:54 - Raven: Tshirts are mostly used for one day events in this age 


Banks, companys,  firms and co use polos are uniform
25/04/2021, 21:54 - @fadu: And much easier to maintain drop in washing machine and dats all but polo tends to fade around the neck
25/04/2021, 21:55 - Nonso: Teens Week?
25/04/2021, 21:55 - Raven: Polos are easier to maintain than tshirts,  don't argue this
25/04/2021, 21:55 - @fadu: And d reason I said lets do other colors cause blue is an eye sore to some people so easily avoid dat
25/04/2021, 21:56 - @fadu: Emmmmmm polos do fade around d neck
25/04/2021, 21:56 - @sophia: Yesss
25/04/2021, 21:56 - @fadu: I have tshirts from way back
25/04/2021, 21:56 - @sophia: I’ve had that shirt for a long time now
25/04/2021, 21:56 - Nonso: @2348181096820 let’s drop designs based on the two styles and see which can work for us
25/04/2021, 21:57 - Raven: We are meant to wear uniforms
25/04/2021, 21:57 - Nonso: I still have my Teensweek T-shirt and it’s still intact
25/04/2021, 21:57 - Raven: Seems Fadun knows more about fabrics
25/04/2021, 21:58 - Nonso: Nobody is arguing on that but people prefer T-shirt from the looks.
25/04/2021, 21:58 - @fadu: Uhmmmmm just saying
25/04/2021, 21:59 - @fadu: 👍👍
25/04/2021, 21:59 - Raven: Well I have done my best

We've talked about this shirt and the design in 2019 and also in 2020 and a lot of us agreed to the particular design I sent today just to come and see other suggestions today.

25/04/2021, 22:07 - @fadu: Ahn ahn colors can not change gbam just like that
25/04/2021, 22:08 - @sophia: Yes it can’t be changed 
Societies in church maintain one colour pattern
We can’t just change things cause we’re trying to stand out
25/04/2021, 22:09 - @sophia: It wouldn’t be a uniform them
25/04/2021, 22:09 - @sophia: Then *
25/04/2021, 22:09 - @sophia: In school or hospitals

08/05/2021, 12:59 - Nonso: Dear All,

Happy T.G.I.F,

As it stands, we have a total number of 50 delegates that have fully paid for our L.E.A.D.S’21 Youth Conference. The retreat centre is on our necks to confirm the total number of delegates attending the conference so they can make accommodation arrangements, we are delaying this confirmation till Sunday for persons who have promised to pay on or before Sunday the 9th of May, 2021.

I am sending this message out just incase there are persons who are planning to pay after Sunday. Please note that we are not the only youth body using the retreat centre during that period and once we confirm the total number of delegates to the Administrator of the centre, we will not be able to add any more delegates. Please and please, if anyone pays after this Sunday, your money would be duly refunded to you as no arrangement for accommodation would be made for you and you will not be able to go with us to the conference. 

I am sending this lengthy message out on time to avoid stories that touch. This is beyond the committee. Everyone should take note and inform their friends and colleagues. 

Thanks and God bless.

Linda Obi
President
CYON St. Denis
08/05/2021, 13:02 - Nonso: Good morning guys as it stands we need to confirm those that will be attending the LEADS conference, please indicate if you will be going or if you’ll be paying by Sunday. Dm me or Nico or signify here.
