1. I was thinking about how this incident relates to real life... 

The incident : if the boy starts to kill the sheep one by one.. They would be aware only after most of the flock has been slaughtered. They trust him.. And have forgotten to rely on their natural instincts... Because gives them nourishment... 


2. The jacket... At once complaining about it's burden.. But still that was the thing which saved him from cold... 
We shld be grateful for the things we have... For example the jacket in the story... 


3. His courage is commendable... Very much inspired by this guy... 


4. His father's buried desire... Of travelling...
And why he allowed his son to be a shepherd... And know abt the world... 

5. I related the fact that "sheeps thought only about food and water... "
Thus how wide is their sphere of awareness... 
Every being has it's awareness limit... 


6. The boy went to the old woman... He was skeptical... But then he had the courage to give it a try... 
Whenever we have any idea... Or any thought in mind about doing something... Or trying anything.. 
I think we shod step ahead and do it... 
Give it a try... 

7. It is clear... The boy loved to travel... And that is so satisfying to read...

21/02/21, 3:37 pm - Krishna Sisodiya: Hey all. JGD!! 😊
Let's join together and listen to the knowledge of the highest form, one of the most enlightening discourses i.e.

 *Commentary on ASHTAVAKRA GITA by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar ji with Vishesh Bhaiya*❤️

_*Starting this Tuesday, 23rd Feb, 5 days a week from 10:00pm- 10:40pm on Zoom*_

*What is Ashtavakra Gita*✨
The Ashtavakra Gita illuminates an ancient conversation between the sage Ashtavakra and Janaka, a king with both worldly responsibilities and deep spiritual questioning about the nature of reality. "What is real?" Janaka asks. So begins one of the most unique conversation to ever take on this planet, as Ashtavakra takes Janaka by the hand and leads him step by step into deeper levels of understanding until enlightenment dawns. 

_*The Ashtavakra Gita examines the mind, ego, conflict and the self with the unparalleled insight that only a master can offer.*_
Let's all listen to the captivating talks together in the group and unfold the meaning. 

*It would be a good idea to donate minimum 200/300 rupees towards the Art of living service projects. Consider it as your commitment amount for these sessions*. Go to this link to make donations 
https://programs.org.in/ekam/index.php/public/donatenow

15/05/21, 6:04 pm - Gourav: Helloooo People! ❤️ 
How are you doing 
Since we all are facing issues regarding time management and procastination,

This time we've thought of reading "Eat That Frog" 

*Review* : 
Eat That Frog is the most accessible book on time management and personal productivity – I recommend you read this one before you learn any particular time management system. ... If you are serious about getting more things done, this would be a great book to start with. 

Very much needed in this time! Right?

15/06/21, 3:13 pm - Gourav: Ikr 😂😂😂
15/06/21, 3:13 pm - Krishna Sisodiya: Ist chapter is really full of true wisdom
15/06/21, 3:16 pm - Gourav: Om is the bow.. 
Arrow is the soul
15/06/21, 3:16 pm - Gourav: Brahman is the target
15/06/21, 3:17 pm - Krishna Sisodiya: Siddhartha silently and indirectly said that all the practices done by his father and other wise mans is not satisfying the soul to have unending peace. 
Real tool to go in deep rest is meditation.
15/06/21, 3:18 pm - Gourav: At first I imagined the opposite... 
Soul is the bow and 
Om shld be arrow... But no.. 

Understanding this has a different joy to it

Do we think we need a more cool name?
 "Bookaholics" Is what we have now 
A name more specific and unique.. 

I should have asked this before😅
But still... If all of us want. Then only we'll change our book club name. 
Or else we'll keep it the same 
What do you say.. Should we change it?
21/06/21, 12:20 pm - Arpit Mahoday: 😂mujhe koi dikkat nhi he naam se but bdl bhi lenge to bhi koi dikkat nhi

Only Pratik and I were their in the meet till now. And only Krishna gave prior notice. 

*This shows serious irresponsibility.*

No need to be afraid If we haven't read the book. This monthly meet is not just about book reading. 

There are some really nice things I wanted to discuss in this meet. And pretty disappointed. 

Let's postpone it. 
And keep the timings for sometime tomorrow.

26/09/21, 5:55 pm - Gourav: Just remembered one more thing about expectation! 

If someone had an unexpressed expectation from you.. You didn't know the expectation basically.. And you didn't fulfilled it. 

So this means the system is out of integrity. 

Can't explicitly state if you (individually) are in integrity or out of integrity. 
It depends on, if you knew anything about it. 
Did you felt something is wrong 
If you knew something's out-of-place before hand... And you ignored it. You are out of integrity. 

If you didn't even had a sign. Then you are complete and in.. Till the moment. 
Disappointment is expressed. 
Now your task is to ask for expectation. 

It is part of our job to get out all of our expectations known to us.

20/11/21, 11:30 pm - Krishna Sisodiya: People should probably start more books than they do. This doesn’t mean you need to read each book page-by-page. You can skim the table of contents, chapter titles, and subheadings. Pick an interesting section and dive in for a few pages. Maybe flip through the book and glance at any bolded points or tables. In ten minutes, you’ll have a reasonable idea of how good it is.

1. Skip the foreword 

*2. Read 2 books at a time*

3. Keep your phone in another room

*4. View reading as a gift, Not a Chore*

5. Replace screen time with book time 

*6. Read every day even if it's only for 5 mins*

7. Keep an ebook on your phone
06/12/21, 12:04 am - Gourav: ✨ *Motivate yourself to read!!*

Frequently introspect on *Why you are reading?* 🧠
06/12/21, 10:33 am - Gourav: *Igniting step Done:*✌🏻
Pratik & Gourav 

*Goals* :
Pratik : finish "Limitless"
Gourav : finish "Greenlights" & start "Chaplin's auto... 

*** Will read in the morning only... because delaying the reading till night just makes it harder & the purpose of reading is also not met. 

*Intentions*... Gain knowledge & by continuous reading - gain the fluency of expressing thoughts... 

*Threshold pages*- 10 pages for both
(If we read less than 10 pages, it won't be marked in the Buddy Record) 

_We're buying a separate diary for book reading - to put knowledge points in it._
_Which will help in retaining it & a quick review afterwards._

19/12/21, 1:23 pm - Gourav: * *let's put our views* 
By appreciating what's good in the particular logo 
& maybe criticizing what's bad
19/12/21, 1:23 pm - Gourav: Colors are good & this one looks decent
19/12/21, 1:26 pm - Gourav: Maybe we need a bit more thicker lines... 
These are just getting veiled away
19/12/21, 1:29 pm - Gourav: The sun.. 

Yes it is resembling the "beyond" Too

An idea -  
Complete the sun (whole circle)... 
The color after dusk at the bottom & the bright sun color on the upper part 
Pages... Just white maybe.. Or whatever suits that
19/12/21, 1:37 pm - Krishna Sisodiya: This one is good

19/12/21, 1:56 pm - Krishna Sisodiya: Good things about this logo:
 1. Infinity sign 
2. Pages are looking attractive

*Buddy System* 

Head by Krishna Bhaiya:-
1. Buddies are decided

02/01/22, 9:50 pm - Gourav: You deleted this message
02/01/22, 9:51 pm - Arpit Mahoday: surely I'll do this time
02/01/22, 9:56 pm - Gourav: If buddy is busy & not responding.. 
Don't get demotivated -- Keep sending reminders -- Irritating someone for their own good is not something bad. 

* We should talk to the buddy on call if there is a gap longer than 5 days.. & figure out things 

* good strategy -- Keep 2 books at a time to read -- 1 non fictional (the one that takes efforts to read) , the other fictional (Story of your interest)
02/01/22, 9:56 pm - Gourav: You deleted this message
02/01/22, 9:59 pm - Gourav: Mini Session:

Not a hard & fast activity, that will take up days to prepare for .. 
Come unprepared -- Take 5 mins to form your thoughts and present something to the audience-- 
Anything you are currently working upon 

No need to worry, if he audience would like it or not 
It's our stage to try & become better

Meko jhelne ke.liye😂
24/04/22, 4:43 pm - Gourav: No it was not jhelna😂.. It was good.
24/04/22, 4:50 pm - Gourav: *Just something to remind everyone:*

The purpose of mini session is the development & growth of the facilitator. 
The facilitator shld become a better version of him/herself✨

Even if the audience doesn't understands a single word. It's okay. It's already the second priority. 1st is learning & development of the person who's taking the mini session.

So try doing all the mistakes here. 
Speak in English. Maybe, stutter a lot & forget what you were going to speak about... In the middle of the session. 
All of that is fine 💛

The quicker you face your fears, the quicker you grow. 
And you will be very fluent in a few sessions only. 
So go ahead. Try your best to speak in English. (If you want to develop your English speaking skills). 
Nobody is going to judge you🌼
24/04/22, 4:51 pm - Gourav: This is a safe space for you to experiment, learn and grow❤️
24/04/22, 6:32 pm - Arpit Mahoday: 👍

The bacterias breed in the space between your teeths.. And eat them. 
In 5 7 yrs we'll be in a lot of trouble... And also might need to pay 10s of 1000s of rupees for undoing the damage done and maybe it'll be impossible.
