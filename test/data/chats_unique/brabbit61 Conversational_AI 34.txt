3/18/19, 8:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/ Ma'am,
I'm Jenit Jain, studying in my 3rd year of Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology.
I was intrigued by your company and I would love to be a part of your team.
I have been studying Artificial intelligence since my first year and haven't looked back. I have implemented several algorithms with success, have past experience working with LSTM and CNN models, did an internship where I was responsible for building models to solve problems related to computer vision and automating tasks by extracting information through data mining. I'm also working towards a minor in Intelligent Systems.
I would be obliged if I get an opportunity to work with your company and help build real life solutions.
Thank you.

5/20/19, 11:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Hey Suraj,

I regret to inform you that I won't be able to participate in the internship.
I have realized that it will be more beneficial for me if I spend time practicing for my forthcoming placements that commence as soon as my semester starts.
I will always regret not being able to contribute to the cool 'iron man' things that you're building and I would like to apologize for the inconvenience.
I wish Dimension NXG all the successes in the future.

Thank you,
Jenit Jain.
5/20/19, 11:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Is this fine?
5/20/19, 11:40 PM - Harshit Saxena: Why mention the cool ‘iron man’ thing
5/20/19, 11:40 PM - Harshit Saxena: Sounds condescending

5/22/19, 11:24 PM - Harshit Saxena: I need a minimum of D in math and if I get that after makeup then cgpa will cross 6 :D
5/22/19, 11:24 PM - Jenit Jain: Ooo
5/22/19, 11:24 PM - Harshit Saxena: But E aagya toh 6 cross nahi hoga

5/25/19, 11:18 AM - Jenit Jain: https://forms.gle/jpB6yifYmDPiY253A
5/25/19, 11:18 AM - Jenit Jain: This is the link we got with this
5/27/19, 10:24 AM - Jenit Jain: Group dekh 😂
5/27/19, 10:24 AM - Jenit Jain: Was getting tired of his Dubai trip
5/27/19, 10:25 AM - Harshit Saxena: Hahaha
5/27/19, 10:25 AM - Harshit Saxena: I know the man
5/27/19, 10:25 AM - Harshit Saxena: Tera last message dekha and I was like jenit ladega aaj Vidit se
5/27/19, 10:25 AM - Harshit Saxena: 😂😂😂
5/27/19, 10:26 AM - Jenit Jain: I was happy when kaustubh replied
5/27/19, 10:26 AM - Jenit Jain: Ab nahi hoga
5/27/19, 10:31 AM - Harshit Saxena: Ab bata
5/27/19, 10:31 AM - Harshit Saxena: Vidit ne bada chada ke bola ya nahi?
5/27/19, 10:31 AM - Harshit Saxena: 😂
5/27/19, 10:44 AM - Jenit Jain: Let me read
5/27/19, 10:47 AM - Jenit Jain: Man my timing is wrong every fucking time
5/27/19, 10:47 AM - Jenit Jain: Yeh to achi story Nikli 😂
5/27/19, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Checking wait
5/27/19, 6:23 PM - Jenit Jain: so the dataset is basically just the description of the movie
5/27/19, 6:23 PM - Jenit Jain: like if the genre is 1 then that movie is part of that genre
5/27/19, 6:23 PM - Jenit Jain: vice versa
5/27/19, 6:23 PM - Jenit Jain: and the prediction is whether the movie was a success or not
5/27/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: then the standard scalar function is used to normalize the dataset
5/27/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
5/27/19, 6:26 PM - Jenit Jain: we need to do this because the columns from G to L are not in the range from -1 to 1
5/27/19, 6:27 PM - Jenit Jain: we do this scalar normalization because we don't want anyone feature to affect the model more. like if the votes are in millions and the genre is just 0 or 1, change in the number of votes will affect the output more because it is such a big value so that's why you just normalize all features
5/27/19, 6:27 PM - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
5/27/19, 6:28 PM - Jenit Jain: clf = svm.SVC()
y_pred_Svm=clf.fit(X_train,Y_train).predict(X_test)
LogReg = LogisticRegression()
LogReg.fit(X_train, Y_train)
y_pred_Log = LogReg.predict(X_test)
5/27/19, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: this is basically creating 2 different models using the training set and getting the predictions on the test set
5/27/19, 6:29 PM - Jenit Jain: confusion matrix, in this case, is a 2*2 matrix
5/27/19, 6:30 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
5/27/19, 6:30 PM - Jenit Jain: basically the principal diagonal elements should be as large ass possible and the other elements should be as less
5/27/19, 6:31 PM - Jenit Jain: acc1 = accuracy_score(Y_test,y_pred_Svm)
acc2 = accuracy_score(Y_test,y_pred_Log)
5/27/19, 6:31 PM - Jenit Jain: this is self-explanatory
5/27/19, 6:32 PM - Jenit Jain: precision and recall are 2 performance measures. I don't really understand the significance of either
5/27/19, 6:32 PM - Jenit Jain: but f1 score is calculated as
5/27/19, 6:32 PM - Jenit Jain: f1 = 2 * (p*r)/(p+r)
5/27/19, 6:32 PM - Jenit Jain: higher f1 is better basically
5/27/19, 6:33 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
5/27/19, 6:38 PM - Harshit Saxena: damn
5/27/19, 6:38 PM - Harshit Saxena: need some time to understand all this
5/27/19, 6:38 PM - Harshit Saxena: fuck
5/27/19, 6:53 PM - Harshit Saxena: Ek baar laptop pe tum kar
5/27/19, 6:53 PM - Harshit Saxena: Run kar*
5/27/19, 6:53 PM - Harshit Saxena: And fir call kar, please
5/27/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Arre Bata toh sahi Kya hua isme
5/27/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Mera internship ka run chal Raha hai isliye abhi nahi Kar sakta
5/27/19, 6:54 PM - Harshit Saxena: <Media omitted>
5/27/19, 6:54 PM - Harshit Saxena: Don’t understand these values
5/27/19, 6:54 PM - Harshit Saxena: Also jab test file run karta hoon
5/27/19, 6:54 PM - Harshit Saxena: Tab error ata hai
5/27/19, 6:55 PM - Harshit Saxena: <Media omitted>
5/27/19, 6:55 PM - Harshit Saxena: Free hoke raat mein call karliyo but please karliyo
5/27/19, 6:55 PM - Harshit Saxena: Kal subh submission hai
5/27/19, 6:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Accuracy is just number of wrong predictions
5/27/19, 6:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Precision and recall ka formula dekh
5/27/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: False positives are those instances where the model predicts the output as 1 (movie is successful) but actually the movie wasn't successful
5/27/19, 6:58 PM - Jenit Jain: This is your 2 by 2 matrix that is printed
5/27/19, 7:00 PM - Jenit Jain: So 162 movies which weren't successful, the model also predicted it wasn't successful

27 successful movies, the model predicted they are successful

11 movies which weren't successful, model predicted that they were successful
5/27/19, 7:01 PM - Jenit Jain: And accuracy = (162+27)/(162+27+11+10) = correctly predicted/all= 0.9
5/27/19, 7:03 PM - Harshit Saxena: Prediction using SVM and Prediction using Logestic Regrrssion ka kya scene hai?
5/27/19, 7:03 PM - Harshit Saxena: All the 0s and 1s
5/27/19, 7:03 PM - Harshit Saxena: ..
5/27/19, 7:04 PM - Harshit Saxena: Also what does actual mean in this?
5/27/19, 7:04 PM - Harshit Saxena: Actual yes and Actual no
5/27/19, 7:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Basically Jo test set mai instances hai, according to svm model all the movies were not successful, and according to logistic regression only the first 2 movies were successful. Number of elements in that prediction list is basically the number of elements in the test set X_test
5/27/19, 7:07 PM - Jenit Jain: See the test set is part of the csv file for which we KNOW the output. So the given output is the Actual output, andthe predicted one is predicted by the svm/lr classifier given only the input
5/27/19, 7:09 PM - Harshit Saxena: The total number of movies in the training csv is 1000
5/27/19, 7:09 PM - Harshit Saxena: Yeh 13 kyun dikha rha hai?
5/27/19, 7:10 PM - Harshit Saxena: Out of which total successful movies are 772
5/27/19, 7:10 PM - Harshit Saxena: According to the csv file. Last column
5/27/19, 7:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Nevermind, this is happening on check.csv
5/27/19, 7:13 PM - Harshit Saxena: Ohhhhh
5/27/19, 7:13 PM - Harshit Saxena: Got it
5/27/19, 7:13 PM - Harshit Saxena: Got it
5/27/19, 7:13 PM - Harshit Saxena: ❤❤❤❤
5/27/19, 7:13 PM - Jenit Jain: why is this your lab proj
5/27/19, 7:14 PM - Harshit Saxena: My lab instructor is chutiya guy who was very vague about the lab’s project requirements and shit
5/27/19, 7:14 PM - Harshit Saxena: So I just asked one of the guy doing the lab with me to get someone else’s project
5/27/19, 7:14 PM - Harshit Saxena: That they did last semester
5/27/19, 7:14 PM - Harshit Saxena: Yeh banda akhand chutiya hai
5/27/19, 7:15 PM - Harshit Saxena: Hello world ke aage koi program nahi samjh sakta
5/27/19, 7:15 PM - Harshit Saxena: Issliye I’m trying to understand this
5/27/19, 7:18 PM - Harshit Saxena: Also, why this difference in result
5/27/19, 7:18 PM - Harshit Saxena: SVM model and Logistic se
5/27/19, 7:18 PM - Harshit Saxena: Shouldn’t they predict the same thing?
5/27/19, 7:19 PM - Jenit Jain: different approaches to detect. SVM basically forms a hyperplane in the n-dimension. so points on 1 side of the hyper plane are in 1 class and the other side are the other class
5/27/19, 7:19 PM - Harshit Saxena: Acha

5/27/19, 7:20 PM - Harshit Saxena: Last question
5/27/19, 7:20 PM - Jenit Jain: logistic regression is more based on probability
5/27/19, 7:20 PM - Harshit Saxena: Graph ka kya scene hai. How to interpret this
5/27/19, 7:21 PM - Harshit Saxena: AUC graph mein accuracy hai? If so why is this 0.83 and neeche accuracy is 0.9
5/27/19, 7:22 PM - Jenit Jain: bro just write the particular graph names on google. mujhe bhi interpretation and significance nahi pata
5/27/19, 7:23 PM - Harshit Saxena: <Media omitted>

5/27/19, 7:24 PM - Jenit Jain: see the 6th and 7th column in X
5/27/19, 7:25 PM - Jenit Jain: its just drawing a graph between 2 random features
5/27/19, 7:25 PM - Jenit Jain: delete that part because there is actually no interpretation for that
5/27/19, 7:26 PM - Harshit Saxena: Okay
5/27/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro I checked ghanta 20 kill nahi hue uske

6/22/19, 9:14 PM - Harshit Saxena: Like sales, marketing etc
6/22/19, 9:14 PM - Jenit Jain: And for the why these employees, draw various graphs of features so you can see

6/22/19, 9:15 PM - Harshit Saxena: And then which employee specifically is prone to leave
6/22/19, 9:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Use Keras for easy model
6/22/19, 9:15 PM - Harshit Saxena: Hmm padhna padega iske baare mein.

6/22/19, 9:54 PM - Jenit Jain: For the other 2 draw graph using Python for each feature for both the classes and see what you find
6/22/19, 9:55 PM - Jenit Jain: So like if some values (one column) is small for all values in which the employee will leave, then that is the trend
6/22/19, 9:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Try to do that and see if you come to some conclusion if you dont see anything then tell I'm I'll think something different
