10/23/20, 8:57 PM - +91 87227 41058: Hi Sir/Madam
This is Vanshita Tatuskar from 3rd semester.
I had a suggestion about the conduction of IA over MS Teams.
Most of us(students) face trouble with uploading of pdf or document over MS teams.
So There was one alternate instead of fixing every person's account.
The question paper can be uploaded over MS teams and the answer scripts can be scanned by us and then submitted through google forms. 
Alot of us couldn't submit our assignments through MS teams  because of such technical issues.
Also about the time slot for the respective mains doesn't really go well. Because everyone has a different approach while writing and submitting. Some prefer lengthy first and then the rest where as some go with MCQ's first and then 5-10Marks questions. I hope uh make it convinent and generalize it to everyone.
Would be grateful if you take this into consideration.
Thankyou
10/23/20, 8:57 PM - +91 87227 41058: Heyy guys we need to talk about this topic with HOD

10/25/20, 8:17 PM - Prithvi KLE: I guess there is no meaning for imp questions because they will be helpful only for 5 marks questions. For MCQ and all you cant depend on importance questions. Must learn everything.
10/25/20, 8:18 PM - Dheeraj: Yeah right
10/25/20, 8:21 PM - +91 97431 50204: Atleast we shld know tat how is gng to ask question...

10/25/20, 8:23 PM - +91 97313 84625: Ya I agree. Reading everything is ok but the thing is it's  for knowledge. To write exam we need to get to know how the questions are asked.
10/25/20, 8:24 PM - Dheeraj: For that balachandra sir will be going to conduct a mock test Soon
10/25/20, 8:24 PM - Prithvi KLE: Lol, Its a very bad joke
10/25/20, 8:25 PM - +91 87227 41058: when you are also not topper then why are saying imp questions of not helpful

10/25/20, 8:25 PM - Dheeraj: The pattern will be same for all the subjects
10/25/20, 8:25 PM - +91 97313 84625: He is not asking about pattern. He is asking about the way the questions are asked
10/25/20, 8:25 PM - +91 97313 84625: In co
10/25/20, 8:26 PM - +91 97313 84625: Bcz there are more sub topics in topic
10/25/20, 8:26 PM - +91 97313 84625: So hard to predict the questions in IA
10/25/20, 8:27 PM - Dheeraj: We can ask sir to conduct a mock test for co also?
10/25/20, 8:27 PM - +91 97313 84625: No don't do that
10/25/20, 8:27 PM - +91 97431 50204: Ha atleast he shld tell this type  question may appear..how balchandra sir gave us
10/25/20, 8:27 PM - +91 97313 84625: Taking mock test in all subjs doesn't yeild anything
10/25/20, 8:27 PM - +91 97313 84625: Ya that's better
10/25/20, 8:27 PM - Prithvi KLE: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How will you decide based on important question the mcq will be asked. There is no specific thing that from here only mcq will be asked. Only for lengthy answers imp questions will be helpful

10/28/20, 10:51 AM - Muzammil: Hello guys good morning,

I hope everyone‚Äôs having a blast during these vacations üòÇ

So um you must have seen HoD sirs message about the GitHub hackathong. This is huge for KLEIT. We got GitHub to sponsor us! They will be giving free accounts to all kleit students.

Now this opens up opportunity for a wideeeee range of tools that are usually extremely costly. Like aws , domain names, and like a plethora of other tools
10/28/20, 10:54 AM - Muzammil: Apart from this GitHub will also provide technical support if we have any queries in using their technology. 

The condition though is that we need as many students as possible to participate in this upcoming hackathon.

If we successfully get as many students from our college and come up with atleast 20-30 good project ideas then its good for the morale of our college. This opens up doors for a lot of opportunities.

I dont think i need to tell cs students what GitHub is and we have direct support from them.


Please for the benefit of us. Spread that message and motivate students and your friends from all branches to participate in this hackathon
10/28/20, 11:02 AM - Muzammil: The registration details will be put up soon
10/28/20, 11:03 AM - Muzammil: We are in direct contact with the GitHub team in the states
10/28/20, 11:03 AM - Muzammil: And they will make a portal for KLEIT and then we can start registering
10/28/20, 11:04 AM - Muzammil: The point here is if atleast 300 students from our college don‚Äôt participate then good GitHub support
10/28/20, 11:04 AM - Muzammil: The US*

I had called sir and said not to make compulsory for tomorrows mock test, they will discuss with LR and CR it seems. 

But I feel that sir will not make compulsory.

If in case they ask again, be crystal clear with your opinion that you really need Mock test or not tomorrow.

Because those who dont have problems its just a waste of time.

But I feel that travelling must not be any issue as we have been living in this situation since more than nine months. We have to learn to live in any critical situation, kab tak aise hi darte baithenge yaar tum hi bolo. And about PG and hostels parents must speak to dean sir to make them available with every proper care and facilities for the students.

Thinking about both positive and negative side is good, but can't you focus on positive one ??

Everyone are just thinking that corona lag gaya toh kya hoga, right?? Problem hai toh usse daudne se uska peecha nahi chutega. Ya toh usme bhag lo ya toh usse bhaag lo.

I said what I wanted to say but taking decision is individuals choice. I cannot interfere in that.

12/18/20, 1:07 PM - Shivain Kleit: See the thing about which pranay is talking is said directly by the hod
12/18/20, 1:08 PM - +91 96324 67247: No

12/18/20, 1:08 PM - +91 96324 67247: Pranay told he got that from info from  office
12/18/20, 1:08 PM - Shivain Kleit: Ya not to you but to the parents he has said so

4/28/21, 8:05 PM - Shridar: *Message from Air Marshal Ashutosh Sharma, Chest physician & pulmonologist COMMAND HOSPITAL AIR FORCE, BANGLORE* 
Please send this message to all your colleagues daily.

*Important Message for all* 

The hot water you  
     drink is good for your throat. 

But this Corona   
      virus is hidden behind the 
      Paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. 

The hot water we 
      drink does not reach there. 

After 4 to 5 days  
    this virus that   
    was hidden behind the  
   paranasal sinus reaches your lungs.

 Then you have trouble breathing.

That's why it is very important to take steam, 

which reaches the  
    back of your Paranasal sinus.

 You have to kill this  
   virus in the nose with steam.

At 50¬∞C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. 

At 60¬∞C this virus  
    becomes so weak that any 
     human immunity  
     system can fight against it.

 At 70¬∞C this virus dies completely.

This is what steam does. 

The entire Public    
    Health Department knows this.

 But everyone wants to take   
    advantage of this Pandemic. 

So they don't share this information openly.

One who stays at home should take steam once a day. 

If you go to the market to buy Groceries   
vegetables etc.
 take it twice a day.

 Anyone who meets  
     some people or goes to office
    should take steam 3 times a day.                      

 *Steam week* 

   According to doctors, 
Covid -19 can be killed by 
    inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, 
   eliminating the Coronavirus.  

If all the people  
   started a steam drive campaign for a week, 

the pandemic will soon end. 

So here is a suggestion: 

* Start the process for a week from
morning and evening, for 
  just 5 minutes  
    each time, 
to inhale steam.  
  
If we all adopt this practice for a week  the deadly 

Covid-19 will be erased.

This practice has no side effects & doesn't cost anything either.

  So please send this message to all your Loved Ones, relatives,
    friends and neighbours, 
     so that we all can kill this 
     Corona virus together and live and walk freely
    in this beautiful world.

          *Thank you, jai hind*

5/15/21, 8:25 AM - +91 90197 51682: Hi guys!
A friend of mine has organized a bootcamp for all the students starting from 17th may 2021, where we all will be taught pyhton, javascript and some projects.
Week 0 - pyhton
Week 1 - javascript
Week 2 - projects
We will have a number of mentors to guide us and clear our doubts.They will also guide us on the projects. We can make projects of our own ideas and they will guide us and help us out. If you don't have any ideas, they will help you with that too.
And its not a live session so you can learn at your own pace so that you can attend the online classes too. Also there is no registration fee, its completely FREE, also we will be given a certificate of completion after the 3 weeks.If you are interested you can register to link given below
https://forms.gle/JjfqJMdQGdoz9uSt9
This is a great opportunity where you get to learn so much and get all your doubts cleared by the professionals for free. You donot want to miss this. Register yourselves as quickly as possible before the slots are full.

8/5/21, 8:14 PM - Pranay: Hey
As the information has come about the examination but we are promoted for externals so  for internals ,we have to come to the college but the problem is that third wave is arriving and guessing the peak is on October so,the point is that we all students gather  only for internals is it fair because after 3-4 weeks we again send to our homes and in many states partial lockdown is started ...think about the students who belong to that states ..it is not that easy to come and go for all ...
8/5/21, 8:16 PM - Pramod Kleit: *And the key highlights are*:  How one can travel so far and prepare for the offline internals and even for lab IA. So I'm  requesting CRs n LRs who are also among us to understand our problems and convey them to upper Authorities, so that our problems shall be understood n resolved. And however the students from other VTU Colleges have already completed their IAs online. We have been promoted to next Sem right?!!

8/5/21, 8:30 PM - Pranay: God knows
8/5/21, 8:33 PM - +91 80734 47907: wow they can teach online and conduct exams offline so fair enough
8/5/21, 8:33 PM - Shivain Kleit: Right now the flights price's are also inflated but the teachers are neglecting this fact for some of the students

8/5/21, 8:48 PM - +91 80731 09545: We have seen the peak of 2nd wave when it started

8/5/21, 9:00 PM - Prithvi KLE: It's not fair to complain on online teaching..... The situation has to be understood by everyone. And moreover if any student is not able to understand, then they can ask doubt in online class there itself. It's responsibility of student also to be active during online class, not making it as one way communication. If you don't give confirmation that you haven't understood, then how should they understand your issues?. But yeah, keeping offline exam does not seem right as there are some issues with many students to come to college ü•¥

8/5/21, 9:33 PM - +91 81231 05012: Which is?

8/5/21, 9:35 PM - +91 81231 05012: If covid isn't a valid enough argument to put forth, then VTU wouldn't have cancelled the examsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
