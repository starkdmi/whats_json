12/21/18, 12:27 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Bro
12/21/18, 12:27 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Huffman encoding kiya hai kabhi?
12/21/18, 12:28 PM - Shikhar Vaish: *Not just encoding, used it to compress data or something?
12/21/18, 12:30 PM - Shabd Saran: Yr ek baar pada tha, but never implemented
12/21/18, 12:30 PM - Shabd Saran: Why?
12/21/18, 12:31 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Compress Karne ka implementation samjh ni aarha,
12/21/18, 12:31 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Try karta...
12/21/18, 12:31 PM - Shabd Saran: Chal dekhta hu mein aaj. Raat Tak bataunga if I get it or not.
12/21/18, 12:32 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ohk, thanks
12/21/18, 2:21 PM - Shabd Saran: I read about the algo, it just that we take 2 minimum numbers from an array, add them and then put the result back in array
12/21/18, 2:21 PM - Shabd Saran: Rather than an array we can use min heap
12/21/18, 2:22 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Oh right
12/21/18, 2:22 PM - Shabd Saran: The final number is our code
12/21/18, 2:22 PM - Shabd Saran: What was your doubt?
12/21/18, 2:23 PM - Shikhar Vaish: We have an encoded list, the Huffman table or whatever it's called
12/21/18, 2:23 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Using that to compress a fike
12/21/18, 2:23 PM - Shikhar Vaish: File
12/21/18, 2:23 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Iska implementation,.. also, will try min heap
12/21/18, 2:24 PM - Shabd Saran: Is it a text file ?
12/21/18, 2:24 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yup
12/21/18, 2:25 PM - Shabd Saran: Then, I think we will have to get each word and convert it into Huffman code and store it in another file.
12/21/18, 2:25 PM - Shabd Saran: The other file will be the compressed version of the first one
12/21/18, 2:25 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ookay,
12/21/18, 2:26 PM - Shabd Saran: I'll also try to implement it
12/21/18, 2:26 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yeah. Coo 👌👌
12/21/18, 3:19 PM - Shabd Saran: Email Dio apna
12/21/18, 3:20 PM - Shikhar Vaish: shikhar.vaish90@gmail.com

12/21/18, 3:33 PM - Shabd Saran: Sure
12/21/18, 3:33 PM - Shabd Saran: Review jarur dio
12/21/18, 7:00 PM - Shabd Saran: bro wo algo complete nhi hai, its just generating the number
12/21/18, 7:00 PM - Shabd Saran: but, we need the output bit-string
12/21/18, 7:34 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ohk
12/21/18, 7:34 PM - Shikhar Vaish: I'll see
12/21/18, 8:44 PM - Shikhar Vaish: just saw your code
12/21/18, 8:44 PM - Shikhar Vaish: yeah its generating the huffman codes.. i want to use it in compression..
12/21/18, 8:45 PM - Shikhar Vaish: which ide do u use btw?
12/21/18, 8:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: yeah. isi mei thoda sa add karne ka try karta
12/21/18, 8:50 PM - Shabd Saran: Intellij
12/21/18, 8:51 PM - Shabd Saran: I'm doing it
12/21/18, 8:51 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ook
12/21/18, 8:55 PM - Shabd Saran: Why?
12/21/18, 8:56 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Nothing sepecial
12/21/18, 8:56 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Aise hi poocha
12/21/18, 8:57 PM - Shabd Saran: Coolcoolcoolcool...
12/21/18, 9:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ok done with implementation
12/21/18, 9:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: just that i dont understands how's it compressing, its more like it has increased the input size
12/21/18, 9:45 PM - Shabd Saran: If you store 'a' in asci then it will take 1 byte and storing 4 'a's will take 16 bytes, but here it will only take probably 4 bits
12/21/18, 9:45 PM - Shabd Saran: It's highly compressed
12/21/18, 9:45 PM - Shabd Saran: And also, can you send me the code ?
12/21/18, 9:45 PM - Shikhar Vaish: <Media omitted>
12/21/18, 9:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ok so we can't preserve the original order of data
12/21/18, 9:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: we just compress the frequency data
12/21/18, 9:46 PM - Shabd Saran: We can
12/21/18, 9:46 PM - Shabd Saran: We can restore it
12/21/18, 9:46 PM - Shabd Saran: Huffman decoding
12/21/18, 9:47 PM - Shikhar Vaish: oohk, going to read abt it
12/21/18, 10:03 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ohk got it,cool cool👌
12/21/18, 10:04 PM - Shabd Saran: Yeah it's good
12/21/18, 11:35 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Random update,: sequitur compression algo is lit👌
12/22/18, 12:20 PM - Shabd Saran: There's also arithmetic compression algo
12/22/18, 12:22 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Will check it out
12/22/18, 12:35 PM - Shabd Saran: It was on Wikipedia with Huffman
12/22/18, 12:35 PM - Shabd Saran: Btw are you working on a project?
12/22/18, 12:35 PM - Shabd Saran: Or it was just a problem?
12/22/18, 12:36 PM - Shikhar Vaish: I was thinking of publishing a paper(not totally into it though).. compression seemed interesting

5/18/19, 5:00 PM - Shabd Saran: how the hell do i debug
5/18/19, 5:00 PM - Shabd Saran: i don't even know where the problem is
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shikhar Vaish: usually, aise me code sahi hota, bas algo galat hoti
think about test cases randomly first,
you'll get the idea about edge cases
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shikhar Vaish: hit and trial karna padta
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shabd Saran: aur koi option nhi hai?
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shikhar Vaish: nope
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shabd Saran: i would have to create my own test cases and then see where the problem is?
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shikhar Vaish: yup
5/18/19, 5:01 PM - Shabd Saran: You deleted this message
5/18/19, 5:02 PM - Shabd Saran: piece of shit

5/18/19, 5:02 PM - Shikhar Vaish: byee
5/18/19, 7:13 PM - Shabd Saran: how do you guys do testing? i write test cases, but in all of those i had written classes and i was giving hardcode input in those test cases, e.g. binary_tree->add_node(3, 4).
5/18/19, 7:13 PM - Shabd Saran: but, there are no classes here and i am taking input from command line. how do you test these things?
5/18/19, 7:13 PM - Shabd Saran: script files?
5/18/19, 7:14 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Use that redirect command, to take input from file
5/18/19, 7:15 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Apna program same rakhna, command line input,


./a.out < inputFileName
5/18/19, 7:15 PM - Shabd Saran: so, no writing test cases using different modules, like 'gtests', etc
5/18/19, 7:16 PM - Shabd Saran: *i don't know any testing frameworks in java
5/18/19, 7:16 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Nope, vo develop ment Mei bas
5/18/19, 7:17 PM - Shabd Saran: so how you test multiple cases? individually check karna padega?
5/18/19, 7:17 PM - Shikhar Vaish: That redirect operator works for any language/program,
java myprogram
< InpuTFile
>OutoutFileName
5/18/19, 7:17 PM - Shabd Saran: i know, itna to OS pada tha
5/18/19, 7:17 PM - Shikhar Vaish: If you already know the right answer, then use diff file1 file2 to see the difference
5/18/19, 7:18 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Otherwise yeah individually
5/18/19, 7:18 PM - Shabd Saran: do you have a script, that you use? a demo?

5/18/19, 7:28 PM - Shabd Saran: imo?
5/18/19, 7:28 PM - Shikhar Vaish: In my opinion;+;
5/18/19, 7:28 PM - Shabd Saran: up arrow key?

5/18/19, 7:30 PM - Shabd Saran: testing koi bhi use nhi karta?
5/18/19, 7:31 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Nope;-; testing framework tab use karenge jab correct output pta hai
5/18/19, 7:31 PM - Shabd Saran: so what do you do in this compare files method?
5/18/19, 7:32 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Write a brute Force soln, and then check
5/18/19, 7:32 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Rarely use karta
5/18/19, 7:32 PM - Shabd Saran: you do know the correct answer. you just have to check if your program is generating correct answer or not
5/18/19, 7:32 PM - Shabd Saran: then, what do you write in a test case? or in the script file?
5/18/19, 7:32 PM - Shabd Saran: how do you test your program?
5/18/19, 7:33 PM - Shikhar Vaish: C/c++ Mei they have this assert function, Amit uses it I've seen
5/18/19, 7:34 PM - Shabd Saran: that's again in testing framework, you said he uses script files
5/18/19, 7:34 PM - Shabd Saran: ASSERT_EQ()
5/18/19, 7:35 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ohk, in that case.. Jahan bi output match ni karrha, print karado io, main program Mei, 

Kuch extra nhi use karte apan,
5/18/19, 7:35 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Kahin dekha Kya tumne?
5/18/19, 7:37 PM - Shikhar Vaish: In the end, you'll end up on hit and trial method, coz it's not always feasible to write brute soln and compare answer...
5/18/19, 7:37 PM - Shabd Saran: i'm familiar with gtest testing framework. in that case, we compare the ouput of the program with the result we already know is correct. if it same (or whatever we want it to be), then test case is passed and if it is not, then test case is failed and it tells which test case failed, or gave a segmentation error (with its location)
5/18/19, 7:37 PM - Shabd Saran: what's the difference?
5/18/19, 7:38 PM - Shabd Saran: i write a solution and then test it against some outputs that i already know are correct
5/18/19, 7:38 PM - Shabd Saran: what is hit and trial?
5/18/19, 7:38 PM - Shikhar Vaish: A lot of times the solution you thought is wrong, "it seems you know that answer is correct";-;
5/18/19, 7:39 PM - Shikhar Vaish: When you try to bruteforce the answer , sometimes it's not possible coz 1e6 possible answers
5/18/19, 7:40 PM - Shikhar Vaish: In that case, u just need to think and come up with better algo, takes some time ;+
Not sure if this convo is helping you
5/18/19, 7:41 PM - Shabd Saran: then, how do should i write my test cases?
5/18/19, 7:41 PM - Shabd Saran: or scripts, whatever
5/18/19, 7:42 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Use random generator, build your own testing framework kinda thing,
5/18/19, 7:42 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ive done that,
Used online tools, but it doesn't help coz I never knew the right ans
5/18/19, 7:43 PM - Shabd Saran: okay, lets say i build a testing framework. i still don't know the right ans, how do i know that my solution is working accordingly?
5/18/19, 7:45 PM - Shabd Saran: how do you know that your solution is correct?
5/18/19, 7:45 PM - Shikhar Vaish: There's no way u can tell
5/18/19, 7:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Intuition, if u think it's correct, u submit, there's no mechanical way/tool to speed up the process
5/18/19, 7:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Keep thinking until u get it
5/18/19, 7:46 PM - Shabd Saran: so, let me sum it up.
5/18/19, 7:47 PM - Shabd Saran: i build a testing framework that generates random numbers and give them as input to my solution. regardless of whatever the answer is, if the program is working, i submit it.
5/18/19, 7:48 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yes
5/18/19, 7:48 PM - Shabd Saran: plus, use some intuition
5/18/19, 7:48 PM - Shabd Saran: well, that's a whole lot of crap
5/18/19, 7:48 PM - Shabd Saran: and just made it more difficult
5/18/19, 7:49 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yeah
5/18/19, 7:50 PM - Shabd Saran: well, thanks
5/18/19, 7:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: 👌
5/18/19, 9:41 PM - Shabd Saran: The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t.
5/18/19, 9:41 PM - Shabd Saran: this is given in the problem. do i have to put a loop 't' times?
5/18/19, 9:41 PM - Shabd Saran: for each test case?
5/18/19, 9:42 PM - Shikhar Vaish: No, loop t times just once
5/18/19, 9:42 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Not for each testcase
5/18/19, 9:43 PM - Shabd Saran: no, in the main() function, do i have to put a loop of 't' times outside of the whole code?
5/18/19, 9:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yes
5/18/19, 9:43 PM - Shabd Saran: okay
5/18/19, 9:43 PM - Shabd Saran: thanks
5/18/19, 9:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: 👍
5/18/19, 11:55 PM - Shabd Saran: bro i'm getting SIGSEGV (segment error) and i don't know what to do
5/18/19, 11:55 PM - Shabd Saran: i've tried many possibilities and none of them lead to a segmentation fautl
5/18/19, 11:56 PM - Shabd Saran: *fault
5/18/19, 11:56 PM - Shabd Saran: because, first thing, i'm not using any pointers, second, c++ does not give segmentation fault on accessing array elements that are out of bound
5/18/19, 11:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ek baar problem link and code share kardo.. abi ek project karrha.  Kal try karun?
5/18/19, 11:57 PM - Shabd Saran: its in c++
5/18/19, 11:57 PM - Shabd Saran: but code itna complex nhi hai
5/18/19, 11:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ok
5/18/19, 11:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Share kardo, dekhrha

5/19/19, 12:01 AM - Shabd Saran: is waale se itni morale down hua hai na
5/19/19, 12:01 AM - Shabd Saran: i spent so much of time writing that code, it failed and i don't even know why
5/19/19, 12:01 AM - Shabd Saran: so frustrating
5/19/19, 12:01 AM - Shikhar Vaish: 😂
5/19/19, 12:02 AM - Shabd Saran: do people come across this kinda problem? or is it just me?
5/19/19, 12:02 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Yup it happens with everyone..
5/19/19, 12:03 AM - Shikhar Vaish: There was a prob that got me for 3 days.. 4th day solve Hui..

There's this problem SEACO, I did over 20-40 submissions  in one night,
5/19/19, 12:03 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Just coz I didn't know mod properties .. i thought it's runtime error/wa, happens
5/19/19, 12:05 AM - Shabd Saran: Hm...
5/19/19, 12:05 AM - Shabd Saran: Worst part is that we don't even know what the problem is

5/26/19, 6:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: 👍
5/27/19, 11:59 AM - Shabd Saran: bro i'm getting SIGEMT on codechef
5/27/19, 11:59 AM - Shabd Saran: do you know what this means? no one in the discussion forum knew about this
5/27/19, 12:07 PM - Shabd Saran: bc, submitted answers ka bhi error aa raha hai ye
5/27/19, 12:08 PM - Shabd Saran: submit kara to ho gaya. wtf is this?
5/27/19, 12:13 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Well, no idea.. will tell if get it
5/27/19, 12:16 PM - Shabd Saran: isme kya karna hai?
5/27/19, 12:17 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Byte code systems folder mei kuch problems hai,
5/27/19, 12:17 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Fir random explore karlo, random cheezein padi hai.. see the Stuff doc
5/28/19, 9:44 AM - Shabd Saran: bro, some of my algorithms work. but they are too slow to get accepted on codechef. any optimization techniques?
5/28/19, 9:44 AM - Shabd Saran: any standard algorithms that might help?
5/28/19, 10:18 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Binary search, disjoint set, dp, priority queue, matrix exponentiation
5/28/19, 10:19 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Binary search , I've seen kaafi baar apply ho jaaya
5/28/19, 10:47 AM - Shabd Saran: I'll try
5/29/19, 12:42 PM - Shikhar Vaish: for every test case
5/29/19, 12:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: you are creating array as needed
5/29/19, 12:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: C++ mei dynamic memory allocation nhi hota
5/29/19, 12:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: u need to use calloc or malloc
5/29/19, 12:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: instead, define every array globally.. with maximum size possible
5/29/19, 12:45 PM - Shikhar Vaish: also, maybe tumne already dekha ho.. if not.. apna io fast kar sakte using this: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fast-io-for-competitive-programming/
5/29/19, 12:45 PM - Shabd Saran: tune solve kar liya
5/29/19, 12:45 PM - Shabd Saran: yeah, i saw this later. now i include this is my code.
5/29/19, 12:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ook cooool.. a
5/29/19, 12:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: abi logic bana nhi.. thinking of BFS
5/29/19, 12:46 PM - Shabd Saran: jab solve ho jaye to ek bar code bhej diyo
5/29/19, 12:46 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ok
5/29/19, 5:59 PM - Shabd Saran: codechef pe ye problem kiya hai tune, CLKLZM?
5/29/19, 5:59 PM - Shabd Saran: killing zombies
5/29/19, 5:59 PM - Shikhar Vaish: nope
5/29/19, 6:06 PM - Shabd Saran: ek baar dekhio
5/29/19, 6:07 PM - Shabd Saran: editorial mein ek baat samajh hi nhi aa rahi
5/29/19, 6:07 PM - Shabd Saran: https://www.codechef.com/problems/CLKLZM
5/29/19, 6:12 PM - Shikhar Vaish: thodi der mei.. abi CERSOL kar rha
5/29/19, 6:13 PM - Shabd Saran: sure
5/29/19, 6:20 PM - Shabd Saran: rehende, ho gaya
5/29/19, 6:20 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ook, coo
5/29/19, 9:58 PM - Shabd Saran: I wanted to ask one thing, when will I be ready enough to participate in live competitions, like on codechef?
5/29/19, 10:40 PM - Shikhar Vaish: - understand the question in 1st attempt
- if u think abt a logic in mind, you should be able to implement it in 1 go (assuming there's no pressure of time/typing speed)?
- have your ide, folders ready.. as in, be ready with all kind of scripts/template code stuff
5/29/19, 10:41 PM - Shabd Saran: ?
5/29/19, 10:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: as in achchi rankk ke liye?
5/29/19, 10:43 PM - Shabd Saran: I was asking, when should I start
5/29/19, 10:43 PM - Shikhar Vaish: right now
5/29/19, 10:44 PM - Shikhar Vaish: have u seen other's c++ solutions?
5/29/19, 10:44 PM - Shabd Saran: I was thinking to practice some more and then get into it
5/29/19, 10:45 PM - Shabd Saran: Because right now, I see a problem, I understand and solve it. But its some the best
5/29/19, 10:45 PM - Shabd Saran: It's either slow, or I am not able to implement the solution
5/29/19, 10:45 PM - Shabd Saran: Something goes south
5/29/19, 10:47 PM - Shikhar Vaish: its okay.. what ive experienced and seen in other competitive coders is that..
people have an aptitude, some reach 3* or 4* directly..
doesnt matter..
everyone gets stuck at a particular level and takes real struggle to jump that level of skill
5/29/19, 10:48 PM - Shikhar Vaish: either they don't practise regularly, or unconsciously stop learning new things
5/29/19, 10:49 PM - Shikhar Vaish: assuming tumhe graph theory mei problem hai.. i think you'll beat that level where you're stuck when you solve, even 2 questions on your own
5/29/19, 10:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: unke solutions dekho ek baar, then close their solution and ..can u implement it from scratch?
if yes.. you'll do it the next time
5/29/19, 10:51 PM - Shabd Saran: I see the submissions, try to understand it and then I do it
5/29/19, 10:51 PM - Shabd Saran: When I can't get the solution myself
5/29/19, 10:51 PM - Shabd Saran: How much practice does it take?
5/29/19, 10:52 PM - Shikhar Vaish: 150 - 300 solutions, you're at my level
5/29/19, 10:53 PM - Shikhar Vaish: dusyant bhaiya.. i stalked him on stop stalk.. 1000 problems solved... not just easy level.. he increased gradually
5/29/19, 10:54 PM - Shabd Saran: Sometimes easy level problems are also hard
5/29/19, 10:54 PM - Shabd Saran: How much time did it take?
5/29/19, 10:54 PM - Shikhar Vaish: you do it in a month
5/29/19, 10:56 PM - Shikhar Vaish: are you feeling frustrated?;_;
5/29/19, 10:56 PM - Shabd Saran: Not frustrated
5/29/19, 10:56 PM - Shabd Saran: But I invested a lot of time in a problem today and in the end I had to see the other solution
5/29/19, 10:57 PM - Shabd Saran: Kinda discouraging
5/29/19, 10:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ik ik, then i realised learn to give up, thats the point i started learning new ideas and stuff.. its okay to see other's solution..
5/29/19, 10:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: there's always one guy who'll beat you
5/29/19, 10:58 PM - Shabd Saran: I also realized that there's a lot on C++ that I don't know
5/29/19, 10:58 PM - Shabd Saran: Plus, I'd need to revise some of the algorithm
5/29/19, 10:58 PM - Shabd Saran: It's just a lot to take in
5/29/19, 10:58 PM - Shikhar Vaish: yup.. isse yaad aya, someone recommended me instead of using calloc to dynamically create array, use memset
5/29/19, 10:58 PM - Shikhar Vaish: yeah
5/29/19, 10:59 PM - Shabd Saran: I use vectors
5/29/19, 10:59 PM - Shabd Saran: For dynamic arrays
5/29/19, 10:59 PM - Shikhar Vaish: C++ 
leran STL Library
priority queue, stuff
5/29/19, 10:59 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ookay
5/29/19, 10:59 PM - Shabd Saran: There are a lot of functions in STL
5/29/19, 11:00 PM - Shabd Saran: What do you do when you feel tired?
5/29/19, 11:00 PM - Shabd Saran: After not able to solve 2-3 problems in a row, it's just tiring
5/29/19, 11:01 PM - Shikhar Vaish: do a thing that doesnt require thinking.. movie/writing, i donno why but writing a poem/take photographs
5/29/19, 11:02 PM - Shikhar Vaish: also
5/29/19, 11:02 PM - Shikhar Vaish: do not exhaust yourself, in 1 day, you should not take more than 2 hard problems(anything that are above your level)
5/29/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: i did that, i lost in icpc prelims in first year, it was a major setback, i started learning 2 new algorithms in a day solve problems related to it the next day, I got tired.. after a month
5/29/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: i wasnt able to do easy problems... took a 6 month break
5/29/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: a russian guy then adivsed this..

5/31/19, 8:31 PM - Shabd Saran: the solution will give the correct answer but it might be slow
5/31/19, 8:31 PM - Shabd Saran: its a greedy algo
5/31/19, 8:32 PM - Shikhar Vaish: recursion hai kya?
5/31/19, 8:33 PM - Shabd Saran: nhi
5/31/19, 8:33 PM - Shikhar Vaish: if yes, submit karlo
if not
approx 10^8 iterations take 1 second
now check it with the questions time limit
5/31/19, 8:33 PM - Shabd Saran: but its complexity is very bad
5/31/19, 8:34 PM - Shikhar Vaish: question ke constraints agar small hai, to n^3 bi chal jaata
5/31/19, 8:34 PM - Shabd Saran: its N^2log(n^2)
5/31/19, 8:34 PM - Shabd Saran: N <= 6666
5/31/19, 8:34 PM - Shikhar Vaish: question ki time limit?

6/15/19, 1:07 AM - Shikhar Vaish: han
6/15/19, 1:09 AM - Shabd Saran: i was thinking of making a website, for our college, where every coder can put their details, e.g. what project they've been working on, what technologies they learnt, where did they learn those technologies, their codechef, hackerrank user names, etc
6/15/19, 1:09 AM - Shabd Saran: now, i know there's already a website for this
6/15/19, 1:09 AM - Shabd Saran: StopStalk
6/15/19, 1:10 AM - Shabd Saran: But, this is going to be exclusive for our college. for people you are getting into coding and need some guidance
6/15/19, 1:10 AM - Shabd Saran: e.g. when i wanted to get started with machine learning. i wanted to know how others around me learnt that technology
6/15/19, 1:10 AM - Shabd Saran: how does it sound? is their a better alternative?
6/15/19, 1:12 AM - Shikhar Vaish: yup its great... "where did u learn it from" is a nice thing.. is it better to have a common page for say ML, and ppl can update the tutorial links?
6/15/19, 1:13 AM - Shabd Saran: there are going to be updates for this website, and i can definitely consider this
6/15/19, 1:14 AM - Shabd Saran: initially, there's just going to be profiles
6/15/19, 1:14 AM - Shikhar Vaish: oohk, yup just a suggestion, whatever works out.. we need this portal..
6/15/19, 1:14 AM - Shabd Saran: later, people may also write blog posts
6/15/19, 1:14 AM - Shikhar Vaish: sounds coo
6/15/19, 1:15 AM - Shabd Saran: i thought this was a great idea, but just wanted to confirm from someone else. might be that there was already a portal for this issue and everyone was already using it
6/15/19, 1:15 AM - Shabd Saran: thanks
6/15/19, 1:16 AM - Shikhar Vaish: there's already a portal(that wasnt publicized much, needs UI improvement) where ppl can upload their projects, or want to work on XYZ project and are looking for a team
6/15/19, 1:16 AM - Shikhar Vaish: if ban jaye, btana if you're interested and want to merge with this one 👍
6/15/19, 1:17 AM - Shabd Saran: well, mine is a different thing
6/15/19, 1:17 AM - Shabd Saran: You deleted this message
6/15/19, 1:18 AM - Shabd Saran: i'm not helping people collaborate, but helping people in getting proper guidance
6/15/19, 1:18 AM - Shabd Saran: we can have analytics, e.g. which programaming language is being most using by other students
6/15/19, 1:18 AM - Shabd Saran: or which technology is currently hot in the market (based on what other's are doing)
6/15/19, 1:19 AM - Shikhar Vaish: great!
6/15/19, 1:19 AM - Shabd Saran: so its nice, right?
6/15/19, 1:20 AM - Shabd Saran: i mean, should i go for it?
6/15/19, 1:20 AM - Shikhar Vaish: yup this is really cool, and its needed.. if u complete the analytics part, talk to placement cell and get money lol
6/15/19, 1:21 AM - Shikhar Vaish: good luck man! this is great
6/15/19, 1:21 AM - Shabd Saran: thanks
6/15/19, 1:21 AM - Shabd Saran: please, don't discuss it with anyone else

6/15/19, 5:40 PM - Shabd Saran: how does Mext.in does it?
6/15/19, 5:41 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Manipal check karna hai, to regex it is
6/15/19, 5:41 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Valid email id hai, to otp/email confirming
6/15/19, 5:41 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Let me ask, I think Google firebase
6/15/19, 5:41 PM - Shabd Saran: firebase? for checking emails/
6/15/19, 5:41 PM - Shabd Saran: ?
6/15/19, 5:42 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yup, google authentication hai usme,

7/2/19, 8:53 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Bro ek doubt tha
7/2/19, 8:53 PM - Shikhar Vaish: C++ Mei dynamic memory allocation hota hai?
7/2/19, 8:54 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Like har loop iteration pe,
are[n] karke array creatr karna
7/2/19, 8:54 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Does it give any error on Codechef?
7/2/19, 10:22 PM - Shabd Saran: Nhi, well, depends how many loop. If it's too much and the size of the array is also very big then memory will be exhausted
7/2/19, 10:22 PM - Shabd Saran: Yes
7/2/19, 10:31 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ookay

7/18/19, 12:02 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Ooky
7/18/19, 12:38 AM - Shabd Saran: are we just gonna have a mobile application or should we also consider a web portal?
7/18/19, 12:43 AM - Shikhar Vaish: I don't wanna do that rn, app pe focus karte
7/18/19, 12:43 AM - Shikhar Vaish: If it's a need to karenge
7/18/19, 12:43 AM - Shabd Saran: sure
7/19/19, 2:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Bro, iska detail jaruri hai kya?
7/19/19, 2:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Like areas likh diye , specifically kya kar rhe, it's gonna be mix
7/19/19, 2:51 PM - Shikhar Vaish: I'm trying to list framework/libraries.. thodi der mei update karta
7/19/19, 2:55 PM - Shikhar Vaish: or will it be better to have someting like this:
Tarushi: Review analysis, Data Cleaning, Safe Route Machine Learning model
Aditya: App development for iOS, Android
Shikhar: Maps, Login API
is type ka detail chaihye kya?
7/19/19, 2:56 PM - Shabd Saran: Kya Kar Rahe hai se matlab ki Kya hoga tumhare end per
7/19/19, 2:56 PM - Shabd Saran: This will be good. But we must have a flow
7/19/19, 2:56 PM - Shabd Saran: You know what I mean?
7/19/19, 2:56 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ookay , han mei confused tha.. got it.. abi karta
7/19/19, 2:57 PM - Shabd Saran: Like when this happens, then this will be triggered resulting in this
7/19/19, 2:57 PM - Shabd Saran: Sure
7/19/19, 3:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ok so backend pe rough idea:

users api: login/create account/email verification/different user modes
location api: live location(private mode, public mode) sharing
route api: route-suggestion-list, filters
review api: route-review, transport-provider-review
7/19/19, 3:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: mei isko hun dono mei divide karrha, actual mei kaise karna.. we can split later?
7/19/19, 3:05 PM - Shabd Saran: I can have users API and you can have location api
7/19/19, 3:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ook
7/19/19, 3:05 PM - Shabd Saran: Review API ka workload divide Kar lenge
7/19/19, 3:05 PM - Shabd Saran: Jitna modular hoga utna hi better
7/19/19, 3:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: okay..
7/19/19, 3:56 PM - Shabd Saran: Server application nodejs mein ya Java?
7/19/19, 3:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Java mei mereko practise nhi hai
7/19/19, 3:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Nodejs kardete
7/19/19, 3:57 PM - Shabd Saran: Sure. Just asking
7/19/19, 4:01 PM - Shabd Saran: Vese technologies used koi negative impact to nhi hota na?
7/19/19, 4:02 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Hackathons mei nhi hota
7/19/19, 4:02 PM - Shabd Saran: Cool
7/19/19, 4:03 PM - Shikhar Vaish: But, jis type ka product him Bana rhe, i saw actually mei iske liye postgresql and Java server use karte
7/19/19, 4:03 PM - Shabd Saran: That's why I asked
7/19/19, 4:03 PM - Shabd Saran: Nodejs is not used for high computations
7/19/19, 4:03 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Performance,.. isko counter karne ke liye I added NGINX just in case.
7/19/19, 4:04 PM - Shabd Saran: Simple rest API ke liye to it's good Varna it's not recommended
7/19/19, 4:04 PM - Shabd Saran: What's NGINX?
7/19/19, 4:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Oh, ye pehli Baar dekh rha itna detail document maang rhe, group pe poocho if anyone got any idea
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Server load balancing ke liye, it's like a intermediate server to manage multiple servers
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shabd Saran: Idea regarding what?
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shabd Saran: Okay, cool
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shabd Saran: Kinda like microservice architecture
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Tech stack mei koi problems, we're not using ideal tech stack
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shabd Saran: Hmm
7/19/19, 4:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ohkay
7/19/19, 4:08 PM - Shabd Saran: You divide up all your work into services, and then call these services according to use requests.
7/19/19, 4:09 PM - Shabd Saran: One service can interest with another service but has no dependency on any other service at all
7/19/19, 4:09 PM - Shabd Saran: *interact
7/19/19, 4:09 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ookay
7/19/19, 10:08 PM - Shabd Saran: bro "Next Larger Element" problem solve kari hai tune?
7/19/19, 10:08 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Nopee
7/19/19, 10:08 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Codechef ya hacjerrank?
7/19/19, 10:08 PM - Shabd Saran: its a standard problem
7/19/19, 10:08 PM - Shabd Saran: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/
7/19/19, 10:09 PM - Shabd Saran: second solution is the efficient solution (the actual one)
7/19/19, 10:09 PM - Shabd Saran: i can't really get this algorithm
7/19/19, 10:09 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ooky dekhta
7/19/19, 10:09 PM - Shabd Saran: they also have a video for this one
7/19/19, 10:09 PM - Shabd Saran: inka code bhaut ganda hai
7/19/19, 10:09 PM - Shabd Saran: tu solve karo to code bhejdio
7/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ok
7/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shabd Saran: baaki report mein kitna hua?
7/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Karna kya hai?
7/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Solution architecture?
7/19/19, 10:10 PM - Shabd Saran: yes
7/19/19, 10:11 PM - Shabd Saran: tarushi ne nhi bheja bas
7/19/19, 10:11 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ek base nhi ban rha.. kuch bi random outline points mei likhne ka try karo pls
7/19/19, 10:11 PM - Shabd Saran: 2 din mein submission bhi hai
7/19/19, 10:11 PM - Shikhar Vaish: I'll try building up on that
7/19/19, 10:12 PM - Shabd Saran: okay, mein bhejta hu fir
7/19/19, 10:12 PM - Shabd Saran: ek bar vo problem dekh liyo. its not that difficult though. I'm just not getting their solution
7/19/19, 10:13 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ok
7/19/19, 10:57 PM - Shikhar Vaish: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element-in-same-order-as-input/
7/19/19, 10:58 PM - Shikhar Vaish: mera ye wala soln match kar rha.. actually ye better hai
7/19/19, 10:58 PM - Shikhar Vaish: btw, mereko ye n^2 hi lag rha.. bas optimised hai
7/19/19, 11:04 PM - Shabd Saran: Jo mene link bheja hai, usme second solution dekh (using stacks). That's the solution.
7/19/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: vo dekha.. sahi hai.. bas order mei nhi hai elements
7/19/19, 11:05 PM - Shabd Saran: I don't get their algorithm, so I asked that if you understood then can you code and then send me
7/19/19, 11:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: okay.. wait
7/19/19, 11:16 PM - Shikhar Vaish: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 11:17 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Line 40 se dekhna

7/20/19, 9:18 PM - Shikhar Vaish: In 10 min
7/20/19, 11:15 PM - Shikhar Vaish: bro vo jo array search operation ka bta rhe the call pe
7/20/19, 11:15 PM - Shikhar Vaish: ek baar fir btado..
7/21/19, 12:19 AM - Shabd Saran: there is an array. count all the number of subarrays whose starting and ending elements are present in a hash table. values are stored in hash table as hash[pair(starting element, ending element)] = rank
7/21/19, 12:20 AM - Shabd Saran: i really think java is a great option for this server application. it would be ideal
7/21/19, 12:20 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Java mei, get post requests handle kar Sakta.. but I don't know how to do live data sharing
7/21/19, 12:21 AM - Shabd Saran: live data sharing sockets se nhi ho sakta?
7/21/19, 12:21 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Mongodb bi connect ho jayega, template ready hai, 
Node.js mei I use sockets
7/21/19, 12:21 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Yeah, I have never done that in java
7/21/19, 12:21 AM - Shabd Saran: i have used sockets in java
7/21/19, 12:22 AM - Shikhar Vaish: OokY, springboot se Kiya?
7/21/19, 12:22 AM - Shabd Saran: nhi, normal sockets in java. socket api
7/21/19, 12:23 AM - Shabd Saran: which framework?
7/21/19, 12:23 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Springboot
7/21/19, 12:23 AM - Shabd Saran: are you good at it?
7/21/19, 12:23 AM - Shabd Saran: basically are you confident enough?
7/21/19, 12:24 AM - Shikhar Vaish: I know get/post request handling, doing stuff with mongoDB,

Sockets se, really no idea uske kaise hoga
7/21/19, 12:24 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Nope not for this app
7/21/19, 12:25 AM - Shabd Saran: iske results kab tak ayenge?
7/21/19, 12:32 AM - Shabd Saran: rehende fir, faltu mein kuch nhi ho paya to vo jada bekar hoga
7/21/19, 12:32 AM - Shabd Saran: ye dekhle ek baar
7/21/19, 12:35 AM - Shikhar Vaish: we can use nested hash:
let mem = {
 'starting_el1': {
     'ending_el1': rank,
     'ending_el2': rank,
  },
}
7/21/19, 12:36 AM - Shabd Saran: 2 rank kese?
7/21/19, 12:37 AM - Shikhar Vaish: if we have 2 pairs:
(starting_el1, ending_el1): rank
(starting_el1, ending_el2): rank
7/21/19, 12:38 AM - Shabd Saran: okay, basically we group all pairs with same starting point. right?
7/21/19, 12:38 AM - Shikhar Vaish: yep
7/21/19, 12:38 AM - Shabd Saran: for a really large data set, like for a city, will it improve anything? what is the radius of one point?
7/21/19, 12:40 AM - Shabd Saran: no wait.
7/21/19, 12:40 AM - Shabd Saran: i'm wrong
7/21/19, 12:40 AM - Shabd Saran: this will improve searching process. you'll just have to search the starting point
7/21/19, 12:40 AM - Shabd Saran: cool. noice
7/21/19, 12:40 AM - Shikhar Vaish: 😁
7/21/19, 12:40 AM - Shabd Saran: searching the pair for ending point will take much less time
7/21/19, 12:41 AM - Shikhar Vaish: i forgot.. hum ye kyun bana rhe the;-;
7/21/19, 12:42 AM - Shabd Saran: routes ranking system
7/21/19, 12:42 AM - Shabd Saran: for a route from A to B. we want to rank it using its sub routes
7/21/19, 12:42 AM - Shikhar Vaish: oh right.. ok coo coo
7/21/19, 12:43 AM - Shabd Saran: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
let say rank of C -> D is 2 and rank of D -> E is 3. then the rank of this route will be 5
7/21/19, 12:43 AM - Shabd Saran: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uXNXQd_UEP1W7pIf6nmReEBDVb_ZzGJ9R9tWVrGeB30/edit?usp=sharing
7/21/19, 12:43 AM - Shabd Saran: dekh ek baar
7/21/19, 12:45 AM - Shikhar Vaish: mast haii 🔥🔥
7/21/19, 12:46 AM - Shabd Saran: ranking system ek baar clear kar deta hu
7/21/19, 12:47 AM - Shabd Saran: we have get top 5 routes from google api, sorting based on traffic, and other google generated data. we'll then rank these routes based on their sub-routes ranking.
7/21/19, 12:49 AM - Shabd Saran: if a user is travelling and encounters a road-blockage or witnesses an accident, he/she can report their current location as unsafe. such reviews will later be used for suggesting routes and ranking them
7/21/19, 12:49 AM - Shabd Saran: anything else?
7/21/19, 12:49 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Cool. this is it..
7/21/19, 12:49 AM - Shikhar Vaish: nope

7/30/19, 11:04 PM - Shabd Saran: For making desktop applications using JavaScript right?
7/30/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Ook cool, so.. like there is flutter that can be deployed on playstore, available for both iOS and Android applications
7/30/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yes
7/30/19, 11:04 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Electron is on the rise, and there's no way to publicise and release electron apps
7/30/19, 11:05 PM - Shikhar Vaish: If I release an update to my electron app, there is a framework that can update your app for Mac and windows only.. that too separate frameworks
7/30/19, 11:06 PM - Shikhar Vaish: What I plan to do is have a common framework and portal, so PPL can deploy apps publicily
7/30/19, 11:06 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Currently famous electron apps:
Vscode, atom, slack
7/30/19, 11:07 PM - Shikhar Vaish: For Linux , there's no auto update thing.. so I need to manually download from the site and install the updates
7/30/19, 11:07 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Squirrel framework
7/30/19, 11:09 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Abhi broadly speaking, we might need to implement/use git for updating apps,

Have a Java server,
Security.. coz this kind of thing can be easily monetized

8/18/19, 2:21 AM - Shabd Saran: Mr. Stark is the owner of Stark industries, a manufacturer of weaponry.
A local Mafia group has hijacked one of the factories in the desert. The mafias want to transport the weapons from the factory to their base camp, and use a single truck to do it.
But, every kilometer the truck travels with the weapons, one weapon falls off and breaks. The truck can only travel integral values of distance, and will lose 1 weapon for every km travelled.
The weapons can be unloaded at any point from the truck, and can be picked up again later.
Given the number of weapons X, max capacity of the truck Y and distance between the factory and the base Z, find the maximum number of weapons that can be transferred intact from the factory to the mafia base.
8/18/19, 2:23 AM - Shabd Saran: Input:
500 -> Number of weapons
1000 -> max capacity of a truck
100 -> distance between factory and base

output:
400 -> max number of weapons that can be transfered intact
8/18/19, 2:23 AM - Shabd Saran: input:
200
100
125

output:
25

8/21/19, 5:54 PM - Shabd Saran: We need to finialize the routing and ranking algorithms
8/21/19, 5:54 PM - Shabd Saran: Around which we'll later build our whole application
8/21/19, 5:54 PM - Shabd Saran: At least the basics
8/21/19, 5:55 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Oky, I'll read about existing stuff, coz koii naye ideas Ni aarhe

8/21/19, 5:55 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yee
8/21/19, 5:56 PM - Shabd Saran: Shortest path algorithm, which one to use
8/21/19, 8:50 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yooo

8/21/19, 9:21 PM - Shabd Saran: this is what we'll use for c++ integration
8/21/19, 9:23 PM - Shabd Saran: we don't need to create an API using C++, we can just add all our compiled C++ code into the java API as jar files
8/21/19, 9:24 PM - Shabd Saran: and the java api will use those functions defined in the C++ library
8/21/19, 9:24 PM - Shabd Saran: so basically, we'll make a C++ library
8/21/19, 10:16 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Damn, this is good

8/23/19, 12:32 AM - Shabd Saran: Sabka hai
8/23/19, 12:32 AM - Shabd Saran: Sahi hai
8/23/19, 12:32 AM - Shikhar Vaish: :)🤘
8/23/19, 12:32 AM - Shabd Saran: Acha I'm trying the mailbox API
8/23/19, 12:32 AM - Shabd Saran: It'll give us at most 2 alternative routes
8/23/19, 12:33 AM - Shabd Saran: That means Google API must give us more than that
8/23/19, 12:33 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Ooo
8/23/19, 12:34 AM - Shikhar Vaish: tomtom mei, they have free but we need to send them special request.. by email
8/23/19, 12:34 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Idk Kitna time tak free
8/23/19, 12:35 AM - Shabd Saran: I don't get it, what?
8/23/19, 12:36 AM - Shikhar Vaish: We send a request by giving our email, they'll tell us the details how to actually get their free api
8/23/19, 12:37 AM - Shabd Saran: We can rank those two routes for now
8/23/19, 12:38 AM - Shabd Saran: Investment Mili to Google API use karlenge baadme
8/23/19, 12:38 AM - Shabd Saran: The main thing about our application is not the map API but the algorithm itself
8/23/19, 12:39 AM - Shabd Saran: We can also suggest them alternate routes while they are traveling
8/23/19, 12:39 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Yeee ,o yes, I have got some ideas
8/23/19, 12:39 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Kal btata
8/23/19, 12:40 AM - Shabd Saran: Sure
8/23/19, 12:41 AM - Shabd Saran: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 12:42 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Ok
8/23/19, 3:32 AM - Shabd Saran: And remind me again why we are using web sockets
8/23/19, 3:48 AM - Shabd Saran: bc, we should use NoSQL database. that the whole fucking reason why it was created
8/23/19, 3:49 AM - Shabd Saran: bc Google Maps use NoSQL database (BigTable, motherfuckers created their own database for NoSQL operations).
8/23/19, 3:50 AM - Shabd Saran: we want to store unstructured data, and we were struggling all this time because we were trying to stucturize that data
8/23/19, 5:04 AM - Shabd Saran: https://www.github.com/trippy-api/prototype
8/23/19, 6:40 AM - Shabd Saran: we'll be dividing this application into different modules
8/23/19, 6:40 AM - Shabd Saran: one will be responsible for ranking routes and routing itself
8/23/19, 6:41 AM - Shabd Saran: and one will be responsible for keeping the DB updated with local news and all
8/23/19, 6:41 AM - Shabd Saran: we'll discuss who will do what
8/23/19, 8:50 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Stapler le aana if still at room
8/23/19, 8:50 AM - Shabd Saran: Kyu?
8/23/19, 8:50 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Dip assignment

8/23/19, 9:03 AM - Shabd Saran: Bc kaha hai?
8/23/19, 4:16 PM - Shikhar Vaish: 6.30 around free ho kya?
8/24/19, 12:27 AM - Shabd Saran: which website are you using for applying for internships
8/24/19, 12:27 AM - Shabd Saran: ?
8/24/19, 12:57 AM - Shikhar Vaish: https://angel.co/
8/26/19, 8:44 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Lab file ka format PTA hai?
8/26/19, 9:02 AM - Shabd Saran: Nhi
8/26/19, 9:03 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Aur lab file sheets mei karna hai na?
8/26/19, 9:04 AM - Shikhar Vaish: First year type physics file mei to nhi karna na?
8/26/19, 9:25 AM - Shikhar Vaish: 5 min mei Jaa rha..
8/26/19, 9:26 AM - Shabd Saran: Abe yr
8/26/19, 9:27 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Kya?
8/26/19, 9:28 AM - Shabd Saran: Aa Raha hu ruk ja
8/26/19, 9:28 AM - Shabd Saran: B7 ke niche milta hu
8/26/19, 9:28 AM - Shikhar Vaish: Ok
8/26/19, 12:07 PM - Shabd Saran: kya kar raha hai?
8/26/19, 12:08 PM - Shabd Saran: radius wala problem solve karle
8/26/19, 12:08 PM - Shabd Saran: samajh nhi aa raha
8/26/19, 12:09 PM - Shabd Saran: how to group coordinates with their radius, basically we only want to search the group and not each and every coordinate in the database
8/26/19, 12:10 PM - Shabd Saran: if only we could hash coordinates such that some set of coordinates have same hash, that would make the searching really fast
8/26/19, 12:11 PM - Shabd Saran: this would also be a problem if we were to implement using web sockets
8/26/19, 12:12 PM - Shabd Saran: we can't send all traveller coordinates to all the transport providers. we would want to group them acccording to areas
8/26/19, 12:12 PM - Shabd Saran: warna unnecessary network calls karte rahenge
8/26/19, 12:13 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Abhi algo/dynamic programming kar rha tha lol,

Aaj bahushrut code examples dikhayega.. data collection ka base prepare kardeta fir ispe aata
8/26/19, 12:13 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Scrape and stuff kaise hota nhi aata
8/26/19, 12:14 PM - Shabd Saran: scrape? why would we scrape something?
8/26/19, 12:14 PM - Shikhar Vaish: I mean JSON data jo ayega, how to look for relevant data
8/26/19, 12:14 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Location
8/26/19, 12:15 PM - Shabd Saran: ObjectMapper se JSON object read kar sakte hai easily
8/26/19, 12:15 PM - Shabd Saran: kuch idea hai kaise karenge is problem ko solve?
8/26/19, 12:16 PM - Shabd Saran: searching bhaut slow hogi, if we just store all the coordinates without managing them
8/26/19, 12:16 PM - Shabd Saran: coordinates grouping karni hogi
8/26/19, 12:16 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yeah, ABI koi idea nhi tho
8/26/19, 12:36 PM - Shabd Saran: ek idea hai
8/26/19, 12:36 PM - Shabd Saran: why not create documents on the basis of 'Country', 'City' and then 'Area'.
8/26/19, 12:36 PM - Shabd Saran: e.g. India -> Uttart Pradesh -> Noida
8/26/19, 12:37 PM - Shabd Saran: that way, we would only need to search coordinates in a city and at this point we won't have many customers
8/26/19, 12:37 PM - Shabd Saran: and we get this partitions by MapBox itself
8/26/19, 12:37 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Yep, nice idea
8/26/19, 12:38 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Prob solved😂
8/26/19, 12:38 PM - Shabd Saran: honesty 100
8/26/19, 12:38 PM - Shabd Saran: i'll try implementing it in the prototype
8/26/19, 12:38 PM - Shikhar Vaish: Cool

	problem statement
		we were given a problem to develop a product recommendation system that can help Dell increase its revenues and also increase engagement of dell customers.

	how are we solving it
		we have come up with a solution that consists of two unique features, game-specific search engine and Automated sale concept.

		now, let me explain you the first one. so, here's how its done. you go to the homepage of our website, switch to the game tab, and now you can see a list of popular games.
		let's say you are a really big FIFA fan and you want to buy a new gaming laptop, but you don't really know the game specifications of FIFA. what you will do here is simply click on FIFA 20. When you do that, we will get the specifications of this game and search our database for matching laptops. And now you have it, all the laptops you can buy to play your favorite game.

		Now, my friend Shikhar will explain you our next feature

shikhar
	
		Another aspect of our solution is to help the dell administrators view product analytics 
		on the dell store. This is offered through a Admin Portal:

		The Portal will allow us to view product details such as Most Viewed product and Least Bought Product.

		moreover, the adminstrator can view the order conversion rate for a specific product for the last 12 months.

		We're also introducing the concept of Automated Sale. So, what it does is it selects the 3 products that have least bought count in the current month and calculates a discount rate using their order conversion rate.

		Now, the adminstrator will have complete control over this sale, ie, he can add/remove the items that are up for sale, change the discount rate and even cancel the sale.

		Now, my friend Shivang will explain the rest of the features on our website.

Adversarial examples are designed to fool a classifier. We can take an image that is classified correctly using any neural network, then backprop through the model to find which changes we need to make in order for it to be classified as something else. These changes can be quite small, such that a human would hardly notice a difference
