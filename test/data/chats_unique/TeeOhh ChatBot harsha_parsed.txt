7/27/16, 9:59 AM - Harsha Varma: I don't think you're wrong there
7/27/16, 10:00 AM - Harsha Varma: Or just keep Russel around for a body shield when bullets start flying and then mourn for his loss and then make a joke about how we don't have to keep seeing him and then the other goes, "too soon dude, too soon"

7/27/16, 10:14 AM - Harsha Varma: I don't know if I'm laughing cause I find this funny or because no one can do the o e job that they are supposed to do

So on my way I'll drop off the vacuum and then go there...
After that I'll give Jon a call and he'll get the van and come over there and pick up the desk and then drop off at Hillside and then get that there and we can go to Walmart
7/27/16, 5:00 PM - Duc Vu: Cool

9/22/16, 3:26 PM - Duc Vu: Fuck me...
9/22/16, 3:27 PM - Harsha Varma: Tell me this isn't that idiot of a guy... Indian Ask It All
9/22/16, 3:35 PM - Duc Vu: I'd prefer this types of idiocy
9/22/16, 3:36 PM - Duc Vu: Ask It All's type of idiocy is nesting 3 for loops and conjure up Satan and wondering why it doesnt work
9/22/16, 3:36 PM - Harsha Varma: 
9/22/16, 3:36 PM - Harsha Varma: "conjure up Satan"... Lost it completely
9/22/16, 3:36 PM - Duc Vu: might have overexaggerated with Satan...
9/22/16, 3:36 PM - Duc Vu: sorry Satan...
9/22/16, 3:37 PM - Duc Vu: but the 3-level nested loops are true story
9/22/16, 3:37 PM - Duc Vu: only one in the lab that had the audacity to try that...
9/22/16, 3:38 PM - Harsha Varma: Worse case just fucking print it so it looks like that, who the fuck even thinks about 3 nested loops
9/22/16, 3:38 PM - Duc Vu: no they can't hard-code it lol :v

9/22/16, 4:31 PM - Harsha Varma: Umm lika or Liza or something
9/23/16, 2:14 PM - Duc Vu: I went to talk to Diesburg
9/23/16, 2:15 PM - Duc Vu: "Some of the students were frustrated that they knew what to do, they just dont know the syntax to implement that"
9/23/16, 2:15 PM - Duc Vu: "Well, sometimes it's a good thing to be frustrated because if you cant handle that, CS might not be one for you"
9/23/16, 2:16 PM - Duc Vu: 
9/23/16, 2:16 PM - Duc Vu: Almost as savage as McCormick
9/23/16, 2:17 PM - Harsha Varma: Isn't implanting thoughts into code pretty much the nutshell definition of CS
9/23/16, 2:17 PM - Harsha Varma: 
9/23/16, 2:18 PM - Duc Vu: They got the step-by-step algorithm...
9/23/16, 2:18 PM - Duc Vu: I think that's more important than put that into codes
9/23/16, 2:18 PM - Duc Vu: but ofc some of them r at total loss
9/23/16, 2:23 PM - Harsha Varma: Well looks like you're doing a good job!!
9/23/16, 2:50 PM - Duc Vu: This bitch is complaining in the lab
9/23/16, 2:51 PM - Duc Vu: "I don't like programming. It's tedious. Can I go to a CS stream where there's not too much programming?"
9/23/16, 2:52 PM - Duc Vu: I'm trying so hard not to snap with "Have you tried the non-CS stream?"
9/23/16, 2:54 PM - Harsha Varma:
