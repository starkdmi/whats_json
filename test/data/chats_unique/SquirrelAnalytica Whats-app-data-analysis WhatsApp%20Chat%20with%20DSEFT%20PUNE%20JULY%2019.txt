14/12/19, 12:34 - Varsha Pai (New): Guys, 
Zensar is a leading digital solutions and technology services company. 
Data Science role in Zensar is going to be a great start to your careers. 
The drive is for multiple positions. GL students will only be considered for Data Science profiles. This is only for 2017, 2018 and 2019 graduates. 
Believe in your strength and give your best shot. 
All the best!
14/12/19, 12:57 - Pratik Nirgudkar: Can you please share with us a detailed job description for these multiple positions or just for data science position as  mentioned, so that we can prepare accordingly and give our best.
14/12/19, 13:06 - +91 75031 39630: I think Varsha is referring to the interviews which are taking place today. 

Position for Data Science Freshers questions today and subsequent work will primarily will be on Statistics , R  or Python, Visualization ‚Äì Tableau or Power BI

14/12/19, 13:13 - Varsha Pai (New): This message was deleted
14/12/19, 13:18 - Pratik Nirgudkar: Yes Vikalp, Iam also referring to the same interviews for Zensar.

Also the position for Data Science Freshers speaks for the job role/designation but not the description about the job profile. We had a word with the contact person here at Zensar mentioned in the mail, they themselves don't have a  job description.

Also vikalp, as you said these are for Freshers and out of the 10 shortlisted from our batch, 3 experienced including me are not allowed/eligible for these interviews considering they have a 2 year bond + No ctc more than 3.2lpa. 
Request you to please consider this going forward.
14/12/19, 13:18 - +91 75031 39630: All those who are attending, All the Best ! Please do well.
14/12/19, 13:23 - +91 75031 39630: Its a Data Science Fresher position. Skills required have been shared. Organizations generally do not have extensive JDs when they come to colleges for entry level positions. Bonds are very common when analytics companies hire talent at entry level. Mu Sigma has a 3 yr bond. Its because they train you extensively. All those attending, please make the best use of this opporrunity.
14/12/19, 13:53 - Varsha Pai (New): Guys,

*Candidates have to update the CPM before and after they appear for each process, so that she can keep a track of it. 

*if you are looking for opportunities outside, you will have to inform the CPM about the same. 
You need to inform about the company and profile you have applied for.This will help in smooth functioning of the process.

Please reach out to me if there are any questions.
