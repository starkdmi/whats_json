11/03/2021, 10:05 pm - subi: hi
11/03/2021, 10:06 pm - IT Abi: Hi
11/03/2021, 10:08 pm - IT Abi: How are you?
11/03/2021, 10:08 pm - subi: Fine
11/03/2021, 10:15 pm - IT Abi: Hello Subi, it's been a long time since we last met?
11/03/2021, 10:16 pm - subi: Oh, hi Abi I'm have got a new job now and is going great. How about you?
11/03/2021, 10:16 pm - IT Abi: Not too bad.
11/03/2021, 10:17 pm - subi: How often do you eat at this cafe?
11/03/2021, 10:17 pm - IT Abi: This is my first time my friends kept telling me the food was great, so tonight I decided to try it. What have you been up to?
11/03/2021, 10:18 pm - subi: Well, I hope you and your family have a lovely meal.
11/03/2021, 10:19 pm - IT Abi: Yes you too.
11/03/2021, 10:20 pm - subi: So, what are your plans for this weekend?
11/03/2021, 10:21 pm - IT Abi: I don’t know. Do you want to get together or something?
11/03/2021, 10:22 pm - subi: How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
11/03/2021, 10:24 pm - IT Abi: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
11/03/2021, 10:25 pm - subi: It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?
11/03/2021, 10:25 pm - IT Abi: Let’s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.
11/03/2021, 10:26 pm - subi: Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
11/03/2021, 10:27 pm - IT Abi: When should we meet?
11/03/2021, 10:28 pm - IT Abi: This message was deleted
11/03/2021, 10:29 pm - subi: Well, the movie is shown at 2:00PM, 4:00PM, 6:00PM and 8:00PM.
11/03/2021, 10:29 pm - IT Abi: Why don’t we go to the 2:00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
11/03/2021, 10:29 pm - subi: My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.
11/03/2021, 10:30 pm - IT Abi: Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara’s high school graduation party two years ago
11/03/2021, 10:30 pm - subi: I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?
11/03/2021, 10:31 pm - IT Abi: She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
11/03/2021, 10:31 pm - subi: She wears eyeglasses, right?
11/03/2021, 10:31 pm - IT Abi: Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
11/03/2021, 10:31 pm - subi: I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too
11/03/2021, 10:32 pm - IT Abi: She will be happy to meet both of you again.
11/03/2021, 10:32 pm - subi: What is she doing these days?
11/03/2021, 10:33 pm - IT Abi: She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
11/03/2021, 10:33 pm - subi: What grade is she going to teach?
11/03/2021, 10:33 pm - IT Abi: She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
11/03/2021, 10:34 pm - subi: Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
11/03/2021, 10:34 pm - IT Abi: I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children.
11/03/2021, 10:34 pm - subi: I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten
11/03/2021, 10:35 pm - IT Abi: You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with
11/03/2021, 10:35 pm - subi: There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do.
11/03/2021, 10:36 pm - IT Abi: Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
11/03/2021, 10:36 pm - subi: Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
11/03/2021, 10:36 pm - IT Abi: Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Subi?
11/03/2021, 10:37 pm - subi: I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
11/03/2021, 10:37 pm - IT Abi: Michael’s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
11/03/2021, 10:37 pm - subi: There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.
11/03/2021, 10:38 pm - IT Abi: So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael’s afterward. Right?
11/03/2021, 10:38 pm - subi: Yes
11/03/2021, 10:44 pm - IT Abi: Hello Subi,  It’s been a long time we have met
11/03/2021, 10:47 pm - subi: Oh Hi abi,  What about you?
11/03/2021, 10:48 pm - IT Abi: I am fine too. So where are you working right now?
11/03/2021, 10:48 pm - subi: I am working at the Bosch Company.
11/03/2021, 10:48 pm - IT Abi: Oh, really. That’s a great company. What is your post there?
11/03/2021, 10:48 pm - subi: I am working as a Software Engineer.
11/03/2021, 10:49 pm - IT Abi: That’s really nice to hear.
11/03/2021, 10:49 pm - subi: Thanks Abi! So what are you up to nowadays
11/03/2021, 10:50 pm - IT Abi: I am a travel blogger. I used to travel to different places and explore different cultures and varieties of food to write it in my blog. I would like to ask you also to follow my blog.
11/03/2021, 10:53 pm - subi: Sure Abi. I will certainly follow it. You are doing a great job by letting people know about different parts of the world.
11/03/2021, 10:54 pm - IT Abi: Thanks Subi
11/03/2021, 10:55 pm - subi: Hey, why don’t you join me and my family for tomorrow’s lunch. They will also be happy to see you
11/03/2021, 10:56 pm - IT Abi: Actually, that’s a great idea. I would love to meet them
11/03/2021, 10:56 pm - subi: So it’s decided. You will come to our place tomorrow at 1 PM. Will see you then.
11/03/2021, 10:56 pm - IT Abi: Ok Subi. See you tomorrow then.
11/03/2021, 11:00 pm - subi: Hi abi
11/03/2021, 11:00 pm - IT Abi: Hi Subi, after a long time.
11/03/2021, 11:01 pm - subi: Yeah dude, where do you live now?
11/03/2021, 11:02 pm - IT Abi: With my parents
11/03/2021, 11:02 pm - subi: Where do your parents live?
11/03/2021, 11:03 pm - IT Abi: This message was deleted
11/03/2021, 11:04 pm - IT Abi: With me
11/03/2021, 11:04 pm - subi: Where do you all live?
11/03/2021, 11:05 pm - IT Abi: Together
11/03/2021, 11:05 pm - subi: Dude don’t joke
11/03/2021, 11:06 pm - IT Abi: I’m not joking dude
11/03/2021, 11:06 pm - subi: Ok, now tell me, where is your house?
11/03/2021, 11:06 pm - IT Abi: Next to my neighbor’s house
11/03/2021, 11:06 pm - subi: Where is your neighbor’s house?
11/03/2021, 11:06 pm - IT Abi: Next to my house
11/03/2021, 11:07 pm - subi: Great
11/03/2021, 11:11 pm - IT Abi: Hi , How are you
11/03/2021, 11:11 pm - subi: Fine ,How is your preparation for the exam going on?
11/03/2021, 11:12 pm - IT Abi: Not too bad, overall. I’m worried about English and chemistry, though. How is yours going on?
11/03/2021, 11:12 pm - subi: Mine is alright. I’m also finding chemistry to be bit challenging because of its vast syllabus and too much memorization in organic chemistry.
11/03/2021, 11:13 pm - IT Abi: Organic chemistry has been a problem for me too. Can we study chemistry together, at least the organic part?
11/03/2021, 11:13 pm - subi: Sure. I think it’s a good idea. Can you help me with English though?
11/03/2021, 11:13 pm - IT Abi: Yes, I can. Where exactly in English you’re facing problem?
11/03/2021, 11:14 pm - subi: Thanks. Prepositions and reading comprehension are the main problem areas for me.
11/03/2021, 11:14 pm - IT Abi: As far as prepositions are concerned, I can help you in understanding the rules. But for reading comprehension, you need to put in lots of practice to get better at it.
11/03/2021, 11:14 pm - subi: OK. Will do. How’s your preparation going on for other subjects?
11/03/2021, 11:15 pm - IT Abi: Other subjects are more or less on track. Economics, however, seems to have an inexhaustible syllabus and I don’t think I’ll have enough time to revise the subject.
11/03/2021, 11:15 pm - subi: Thankfully, I don’t have Economics. But, yes, I’m also struggling to get enough time for revision. Anyway, we’ve to manage in whatever time we have.
11/03/2021, 11:15 pm - IT Abi: That’s right. OK, enough of talk. Let’s get back to study. All the best for your next exam.
11/03/2021, 11:16 pm - subi: Thanks. All the best to you as well.
